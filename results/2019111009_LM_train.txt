Resumption of the session	34.0179758294628
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999, and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.	30.300884997805042
Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded 'millennium bug' failed to materialise, still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.	82.73089796255928
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.	20.82629266764729
In the meantime, I should like to observe a minute' s silence, as a number of Members have requested, on behalf of all the victims concerned, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.	23.00112454480834
Please rise, then, for this minute' s silence.	145.6936123049597
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)	33.05170326724384
Madam President, on a point of order.	32.99230105435773
You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka.	28.177683574576875
One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam, who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago.	45.6402413906662
Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation?	66.00255483693353
Yes, Mr Evans, I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.	144.8195067326087
If the House agrees, I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested.	77.40722215621138
Madam President, on a point of order.	32.99230105435773
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility.	62.14796239078996
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again.	55.493683696231
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.	105.84041792145416
It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability.	32.16617890394645
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible.	23.98102808947446
I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report, not a legislative proposal, and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday.	73.65620843469448
That is precisely the time when you may, if you wish, raise this question, i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report.	51.34056048235323
Madam President, coinciding with this year' s first part-session of the European Parliament, a date has been set, unfortunately for next Thursday, in Texas in America, for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sentenced to death. We shall call him Mr Hicks.	90.12024967355237
At the request of a French Member, Mr Zimeray, a petition has already been presented, which many people signed, including myself.	75.89063198584806
However, I would ask you, in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community, to make representations, using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent, to the President and to the Governor of Texas, Mr Bush, who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.	45.78674489849764
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.	23.8938745556973
Thank you, Mr Segni, I shall do so gladly.	23.607666304338593
Indeed, it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted.	66.31290838784545
Madam President, I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest.	20.407213729404557
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.	10.905106927680375
All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia, too, access to environmental information is a constitutional right.	75.89805078046626
Now, however, he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.	87.37699298826315
We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.	60.546991389577094
These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea, and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament's position, as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted, clear as far as Russia is concerned.	46.44947106351021
Yes, Mrs Schroedter, I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter.	54.08394653894033
Madam President, I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that, during this first part-session of the new year, the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.	40.43489715066058
But, Madam President, my personal request has not been met.	41.03540944485421
Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one, there is still no Dutch channel, which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.	77.67773196515374
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.	40.90252890780329
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors' meeting on Wednesday.	28.352957078993246
It will, I hope, be examined in a positive light.	56.950878822342396
Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes?	46.523174348068544
Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected?	208.6497970158503
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998?	206.46887002931538
Why has there been no fire drill, either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings?	100.61625447231224
Why are there no fire instructions?	42.59110065393145
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?	163.9740330606328
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced?	89.02798240581903
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.	44.631397687378055
Mrs Lynne, you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done.	44.09975384735662
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors, and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.	34.81922602980077
Madam President, Mrs Díez González and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, which appeared in a Spanish newspaper.	48.68640428989065
The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session.	55.446734493090155
I would ask that they reconsider, since this is not the case.	34.88950306768969
The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio' s intervention, on another occasion, and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November.	82.64332774328982
Mr Berenguer Fuster, we shall check all this.	38.19818240079954
I admit that, at present, the matter seems to be somewhat confused.	76.72887840447217
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.	43.26623800787842
Madam President, I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia, considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past?	58.6704463387633
Today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there.	96.80107135915998
So Parliament should send a message, since that is the wish of the vast majority.	89.50714775354433
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.	62.7179415798601
As people have said, the situation there is extremely volatile.	48.31167013178014
There is, in fact, a risk of a military coup in the future.	24.15185574057324
We do not know what is happening.	12.682458063154149
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people?	143.80362288949684
In any event, this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday.	40.62123123927622
Agenda	634.2024716887657
The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	25.72721279773299
No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday.	77.76248780244589
Relating to Wednesday:	65.43086138715962
The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission.	28.42968385455112
I would like Mr Barón Crespo, who made the request, to speak to propose it. That is, if he so wishes, of course.	73.34264110338182
Then we shall follow the usual procedure, hearing one speaker in favour and one against.	197.09158477986372
Madam President, the presentation of the Prodi Commission' s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi, who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech.	40.60055933290899
This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and, therefore, basically dictates this Parliament' s political and legislative activity for the next five years.	45.47534820985807
I would also like to point out, Madam President, that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature. It did so again during this legislature, in July, and then, in September, it voted once more to approve the whole Commission.	64.83424863176877
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.	48.649064897648145
To this end, I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.	26.568004945297485
The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents, that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma. Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme, in which case it should clarify it.	105.5240998654274
According to its President, it is in a position to do so.	21.571309423973865
Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio, I believe that, before voting, it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme, as agreed. Alternatively, Parliament is not ready to examine this programme, as some appear to be suggesting.	74.11700469317772
In my opinion, this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware, in writing, of a speech concerning the Commission' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier, as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February, so we could forego the debate, since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it.	73.92390201362794
My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen, debate and reflect, there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that, if the Commission is ready to do so, we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.	54.12990958145832
Therefore, the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and which you have mentioned, is that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday, including its proposed administrative reform, because, otherwise, we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: on the pretext that there is no text, on the one hand, the President of the Commission would be denied his right to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.	41.05034194083362
Therefore, Madam President, I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.	24.084727379369895
(Applause from the PSE Group)	21.4213999689991
Madam President, I would like to make it very clear that, above all, the Commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, amongst those, the decision establishing its agenda.	28.55339618240664
We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide.	345.42323439081554
But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate, as Mr Barón Crespo has reminded us, which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission' s legislative programme, on the broad areas of action for the next five years, that is to say, for this legislature.	27.946127388408048
Madam President, I would like to say that the agreement reached in September distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission' s legislative programme.	22.99116246478392
I would also like to say that the Commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally, on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.	33.467276546927934
Therefore, Madam President, I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and, when Parliament decides, - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for 2000, which is what we fully agreed upon.	32.86811918384999
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated.	19.804335510467684
(Parliament rejected the request) President.	129.12996008510152
Still on the subject of Wednesday' s sitting, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.	88.87956722852987
The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.	51.78501790316501
Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this?	36.87303503192952
Madam President, I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists. I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda, because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter.	46.20931407971982
I do not know whether this information is correct, but the PPE-DE Group would, in any case, be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already.	66.99244354832484
Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind.	62.26103167589768
That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.	43.75681721800858
Thank you, Mr Poettering.	16.676214794610527
We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request.	67.4219022902838
Madam President, I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering' s lack of logic.	17.11846163401816
He has just been preaching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents, and now he is doing just the same.	32.42476125214875
We discussed that matter and we were unanimous, with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups. As my fellow chairmen will recall, I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax, but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it.	84.6557800167584
It is not a lot to ask.	30.90611248817594
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out, once and for all, the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion, particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.	49.50879806819254
We shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda.	44.11657977748568
(Parliament rejected the request, with 164 votes for, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions)	91.03814816736235
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate.	9.22734892422598
Thank you very much.	10.122046454846277
Madam President, has my vote been counted? I was unable to vote electronically, since I do not have a card.	56.18025759281298
My vote was "in favour" .	55.66287097904537
Indeed, if we add the two Members who have declared themselves, then the result of the vote would be ....	86.76798892427956
Madam President, the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote.	28.55232059236246
There is no room for amendments.	28.828476020690097
Madam President, in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group.	24.471263569739726
That did not happen.	38.138104249524375
I would appreciate it if, on the close of this item of business, I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group.	39.67825477443102
This is an important matter.	10.263038112440347
It would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis.	40.03075971228974
Madam President, I do not wish to reopen the debate, but I had also asked for the floor, to comment on Mr Barón Crespo's motion.	25.756837913766045
You did not call me either.	147.07644590286398
I regret this, but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there.	58.88201960746848
I am terribly sorry, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox. I did not see you asking to speak.	41.502415834110245
Even so, I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes.	76.78524335486343
When we adopt the Minutes for today' s sitting tomorrow, then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.	166.0633032456449
This seems to me to be a workable solution.	16.761369037023417
Of course, the Minutes for tomorrow' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.	41.06803115671927
I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes.	92.43229062240779
Mr Cox, Mr Hänsch, would this be acceptable to you?	68.55326709562333
Madam President, if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not, and cannot, object to that.	87.63114094569431
If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote, I accept that but with reservations.	79.61693564095845
We shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes, as we always do, of course.	41.035683386680944
If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted, then we may correct them, if necessary.	127.38351014210959
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)	109.47496325885326
Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods	39.87604456845234
The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)).	8.535072700448245
Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	16.67405601009924
Firstly, we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training, instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.	50.68832752350349
Secondly, by adopting this directive we achieve a) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped; b) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.	94.78253832857156
Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.	88.8168230061272
All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.	29.89447991996142
Our amendments from the first reading have, I believe, been taken into account very satisfactorily.	81.0870339711958
They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.	126.33947986452225
The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive, is something which I would urge you to support.	48.062985110708155
By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.	67.04990436346426
I would urge you to endorse this.	15.020897182726504
Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.	64.7347466281727
As an Austrian, I still have a vivid memory, as, I believe, we all do, of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel, where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.	83.1837072416162
The renovation project, which lasted for months, cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe.	98.03488000257171
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit.	42.542883891707106
In fact, all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.	40.20162828124832
Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available, so that the right action is taken in good time.	88.20602690802642
All the same, we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety.	53.7503129443902
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.	35.14449638636146
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.	80.84234316882386
I should like to address one final point. We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done.	33.24151933234013
In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.	38.75279797738621
Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has, at its heart, the issue of transport safety.	18.813915401393366
The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway.	30.053650735477216
I congratulate him on his excellent report.	18.5694384210168
Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington rail crash in London, the terrible rail crash in Norway, the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.	98.90153843881814
The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments has been retained.	53.548062475325054
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.	55.08974512203723
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.	91.34775528817417
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.	54.314087951379165
Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.	6.923071394086436
I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and, secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has submitted.	28.8647964843294
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements.	63.13131623975001
This is a pity, in a sense.	19.410452884260415
Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.	53.02584408489265
This is important, but so is enforcement and there are, of course, a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.	31.917845811732054
Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead.	93.1140790141448
Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.	138.9082400937698
Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.	72.81079361984189
In short, the issue is an important one.	36.415128010389054
If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.	42.875366064187645
There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors.	143.3607894785455
These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which causes problems.	285.4397004234781
It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.	56.67425986505699
The work is done. All that remains is the business of enforcement.	111.0070566692187
I would like to mention one final point.	14.16261741643219
With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months' time.	60.1810065226933
This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.	63.296437996282854
This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.	63.95421023492788
Madam President, the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so.	44.29971277000838
The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.	145.30300876437863
Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.	207.3816615339999
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.	69.11693562809286
I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations, although I would have preferred it if uniform, set standards and modules had been established, so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.	96.57875149512925
This, however, does not seem feasible.	34.007709463824135
Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can, therefore, give it my wholehearted support.	43.722038865072484
Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which, though technical, are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.	52.940980782510614
I should like to make just a few comments.	11.228426987626584
Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea.	46.880805527060524
Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this time lag is a little too long.	101.7879678296915
This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.	18.200038194933132
My second point has already been mentioned: it concerns the minimum standards.	32.82987645317739
In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.	76.5875991795667
However, when it comes to safety, I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden, for example, is in principle no different from safety in Germany, Italy or Austria.	130.28256610150348
I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully.	46.828603299688545
Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.	181.63378902075632
My third point has also been mentioned already.	49.68945378821398
As you know, like Mr Rack, I come from a transit country, where this issue plays a particularly important role.	45.42357382696587
We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.	72.83833090716625
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.	38.95409083993166
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	22.64589111818313
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.	52.38320253120563
The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.	40.79882212848983
Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport.	25.331785614740667
As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.	64.65913351950381
The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.	98.6226983192307
In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.	30.899127852871263
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.	139.154328117843
Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster.	73.6376663439275
Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.	65.90537651267998
Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.	24.794948765454738
This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.	35.564338986181454
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.	20.638647552366542
As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.	48.43646010750212
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.	20.04244123719788
The debate is closed.	3.7754896132534173
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	3.2691741867479744
Transport of dangerous goods by road	36.53059084355994
The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)].	6.637617734822177
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European Committee for Standardisation.	32.37854937308019
Delays in the CEN' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive.	93.16959587384693
In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments.	60.52987327408829
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.	44.392500820481
In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today.	27.444878238547034
Should the European Union fail to take action, then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period, until the CEN completes its work, which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.	96.80850313842032
The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community.	27.41442268046951
It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions which are no longer applicable, and lays down the procedures for a) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b) enacting less stringent national regulations, in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.	102.41962946351586
The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity; the Member States obtain more powers.	66.06474224453636
The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own. In so doing, it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.	38.37377914367878
The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999.	52.710348469243414
The proposal to be discussed today, to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road, dates from May 1999, however, and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure.	41.66456362138747
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.	140.2776317448083
We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months.	33.68065597915988
In addition, the need for greater transparency has been pointed out.	27.994755338849934
A further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements, in particular for vacuum tanks, if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20ºC. This is in the special interest of northern European regions.	94.22376354373618
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.	51.773833172789004
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety, but I would ask you to endorse this report.	40.21836685211433
Mr President, colleagues, a happy new year and millennium to you all.	167.8656068608804
I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session, so this is quite exciting for me, a little like first love, although that did last longer than two minutes.	81.92362968243405
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.	8.588050754506149
It is good that this directive should be established now, as, otherwise, Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time, a period of transition, which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy.	86.45324836265155
The Commission' s proposal, however, does not take account of all the facts, such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions.	32.52008879210532
Consequently, I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch' s intrinsically excellent report, which have been adopted by our committee.	28.27345099216672
My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods.	113.91511954255964
According to the Commission' s proposal -20ºC would have been sufficient. On the shores of the Mediterranean, it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that.	36.763992091512854
There is support for the EU in Lapland also, so let us remember them.	60.8823590737693
I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40ºC.	41.71579289606761
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously.	76.7907356598662
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow' s vote.	53.39262228179503
Mr President, with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate.	26.899240320868913
I thought that it was quite superb.	27.889497095251226
On the subject at hand, I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe's roads, railways, and so on are as safe as possible.	55.95891003120763
This directive is a contribution to this.	28.385802025787353
What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.	32.316781705646854
The rapporteur, Mr Koch, to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this, has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN, which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive.	45.51402782099035
That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that, in 2001, we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.	40.18127528781579
Mr President, the report we are discussing here does not, in itself, entail any major changes.	27.73288027855022
Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.	49.373193005684655
It is nonetheless worth emphasising that, each time we make this type of decision, it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market.	53.2389533744249
Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU, both on roads and railways and by sea.	67.45270832502104
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind.	58.80791456523199
In area after area, we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States.	93.858344354101
This is extraordinarily positive, and there is cause to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for the work he has put in on this issue.	34.89505181880683
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned.	23.92119465478721
If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running, it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also, as far as possible, apply to every country.	65.17179274141168
I should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance, namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament, Mr Ari Vatanen.	41.34487141991741
In many ways, the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another.	24.726575332383756
By approving this amendment, we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union.	22.25559995585739
This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind.	31.947773987306952
It is good that, in establishing the present regulations, we can also be flexible.	41.42447734499231
I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment.	15.665895101731552
Mr President, I would like to thank not only Mr Koch, but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority.	27.96727669264161
The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously.	113.86608007854369
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations, and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts, in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.	40.44342983202012
For one thing is clear: even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union, traffic does not stop at our borders, it goes beyond them.	60.9370198841952
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions.	194.76344821142956
If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at?	88.43626841690386
Mr President, I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report, which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport.	36.81473386680991
We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has not been able, in the required time, to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union.	40.4317930511208
This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours.	77.62367292651848
A moment ago, Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures, not of 20 degrees below zero, but of 40 degrees below zero.	90.14152366260684
Of course, we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union, which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.	53.02633713869462
I would like to say, with regard to Mr Swoboda' s comments on the activity of the CEN, that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if, despite the new deadline, we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.	34.633585309998864
Lastly, Mr President, the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out. We have referred to the delay by the CEN, the amendment of certain provisions, the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific.	52.20843460626546
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr Koch, which are contained in the various amendments, specifically four.	48.39166245849212
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.	25.808780897820263
The debate is closed.	3.7754887131066557
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	3.2691741867479744
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination	492.930605444887
The next item is the report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 [COM(1999)344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)].	8.134590198573342
Mr President, it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament, namely Wales.	34.805481375864616
A major part of Wales, as you know, has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme.	118.14402942920677
It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face.	51.625069457189085
We have seen poverty growing in Wales; and growing still further since 1997.	213.8212612198094
We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen.	46.6718443875789
We are looking, therefore, within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality.	68.3904093875792
What is, however, deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been, in a sense, a success of the government. It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces.	67.28335289902199
That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront.	21.17436722639072
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.	34.0967714070293
We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures.	61.36963850609117
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects.	56.17388221200013
We look to it to challenge the UK Government, to ensure that the private sector, which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure, is involved in the planning stage.	74.27345075690607
Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.	53.94991859799151
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent.	53.41573185608139
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales.	29.01236256387112
Mr President, our committee views these issues very differently and, to start, I will speak from the point of view of research.	78.18161661526707
We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee' s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.	55.4288909971109
This will be possible with action on the part of governments, and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.	91.09112422872005
Another matter we would like to address, specifically from the point of view of industrial policy, is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services, electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet, when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds.	58.18822606537447
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.	228.7335028474373
The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry, but today those areas might have become a burden, and they may well be poor, meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production, as I might call it, and the production of services, because they are the industries of the future.	104.07045988534378
In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this, so on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would draw the Commission' s attention to this issue.	29.438651362797042
Finally, as the committee representing energy, we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more, thus, through a process of coordination, increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.	103.07255905092264
Mr President, I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague, Mrs Flautre, who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill.	30.307351430781498
I would like to draw people's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	15.196907993857169
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.	103.79011145588379
In the past, this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.	52.43972132892209
These amendments also fit in with this Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.	92.43665416532947
We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.	118.87475380579662
In her report, Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking, yet desperately needed.	97.19277679282342
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund.	62.15818711972816
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted, as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme.	54.18926903826799
It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance, which is subject to review after three and a half years, and the Member States' annual national plans for employment.	84.14723593970645
We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.	20.387800057583906
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal presented by the Commission, in accordance with its mandate, is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	22.040001002493472
I would like to point out, however, that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us: maintaining a population in rural areas, given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture' s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society.	81.71677272799165
This, as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment, which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity, exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.	81.96840952487223
The consequences do not inspire hope.	69.71202616437958
It is the young people who are disappearing, who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas, all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas.	75.57393050754949
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs.	28.040198600482565
We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union.	33.17468042782897
Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union.	146.2277180324653
Furthermore, three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes.	145.39546552278796
For this reason, one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside of the agricultural sector, in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage conservation, the conversion of businesses, new technologies, services, etc. However, even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive, it is still essential, not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land, in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.	63.55708245620298
Therefore, we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set. We want rural areas, at the dawn of the 21st century, to be competitive and multi-functional, both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities.	59.937922550205364
It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium, and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues, which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport, Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17.	50.08298194713521
In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that, for the European Union, maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.	41.81835075945155
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter, the rapporteur, for her work.	9.524124956475337
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well.	22.303108784492178
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing.	52.42519531550467
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament, at least in spirit, because at this stage, it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise, and nothing but hot air.	55.85438260717736
The truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament, particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives.	43.40906404240202
In our amendments, we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives, so that their application should be reflected, in the best and most profitable way, by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are, when all is said and done, the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.	55.83044427132325
In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives, we think that those who generate employment, the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment, that is, businesspeople, must participate in this initiative.	77.16841035293693
Small and medium-sized businesses, above all, need to take part in the distribution of these funds.	27.562846254996842
If they do not, if businesspeople feel marginalised, if entrepreneurs cannot take part, not only in managing but also in receiving these funds, we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly.	85.79523121312064
Also, in order to attain our objectives, to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment, it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies, to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies.	85.24491849008884
All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business, which, by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations, but complementing them, never obstructing or excluding them, will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs.	74.17127412568063
Mr President, it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague, Mr Evans, of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status.	93.06720414983668
It was because of the discredited policies of his own Conservative Party.	42.810126022907106
Let me also remind him that when his party leader, Mr Hague, was Secretary of State for Wales, he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements.	111.5915332921581
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality.	47.56757750755698
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation.	133.9489226878273
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today.	97.18114486192927
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines.	23.769378671940828
The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration, to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine.	85.88454406117704
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector.	28.172034232931953
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industries of the future.	50.30993832615947
The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about.	48.780657419626955
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape.	52.22560247676796
They should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development, resulting in inevitable delays and underspends, particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement.	119.76289077270003
The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer, either in the Commission or in the civil service.	59.34598764827212
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate, while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes.	123.59132567507893
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad, indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration.	84.18961811184333
If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence, which will be the key to future success.	80.11937757893
This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines: whether EU regional policy with a good, solid, enabling guideline, can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU.	79.43275633287361
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report. She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report.	20.566950757620862
The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.	60.07621201507123
We are badly behind now in this matter.	57.777951813932056
Hopefully, the stands Parliament has taken will help, however, in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation.	151.93760223124443
For the time, the report grew too large when it was being debated.	68.02539271421678
It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports.	105.55484852755485
At this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy, bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality.	43.50046366087703
Our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes.	41.46883608108418
It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes.	36.55501193189251
Our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas.	49.98859607399401
We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes.	49.32068480228577
Projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes.	180.47657419201963
Funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned.	120.55213436818363
Projects have to be carried out more efficiently, more flexibly and they have to be made more productive.	33.71017950732672
While the report was being prepared, it was interesting to discuss the Union' s regional policy in general.	50.277514774628116
For us new members, it was the first time, and this was a very interesting process.	42.48978794572924
This report is very good and our Group supports it.	51.09294578939382
Mr President, Commissioner, as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution, the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group, Elisabeth Schroedter, has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission' s offices for several months.	61.203852004292926
Bearing this in mind, this House should, in any event, demand that, before the Community support frameworks for the period in question are approved, they be studied and submitted for debate in this Parliament, specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today.	76.6765765703385
This is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least-developed regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in European society and to the move towards a fairer Europe.	47.62876747154571
Mr President, we should not forget that the main, strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion.	29.40357165440603
We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results.	82.64466760607557
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions.	33.95316162385214
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.	32.45200009082421
We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator.	74.97397520564698
Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population.	84.67774252489947
We will have to study several indicators, which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others, and how they are evolving.	63.72377360272374
It is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament' s plenary sitting today that Europe' s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions.	65.69619117160595
This fact means that the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically.	31.423267693623355
I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity, as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives.	37.98686377579296
I do not think, however, that this report has come too late.	19.4309649245056
We need to consider it together, so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development, which have been drafted before the directives come into force, can be submitted for revision and proper assessment.	66.53198819623553
We all agree that we should ask that, halfway through these programmes, when the assessment of the directives is made, Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens' representatives.	66.98627854613474
Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is, at least on the face of it, bureaucratic.	39.73467664938887
They need to see the political dimension working, to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens.	99.83653731212925
This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for.	37.503624084941144
I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.	66.36244451898848
Mr President, I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following: there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.	31.02986454926354
This means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent.	35.719217131568904
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.	59.02665381149125
This latter point is of particular importance.	51.997925475807314
While urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers.	90.62979377246256
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone.	26.64969714160763
The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries, mainly through the upgrading of roads, water treatment and related transport networks.	55.949011407086594
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year, which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session.	90.3610459370003
Key EU programmes between 1989, 1993, 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe.	104.06847491778018
The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date. This would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions, the poorer regions in Europe, are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone, as well as within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital exist.	84.98204789585694
In conclusion, while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society.	55.20500183684739
The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions, financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment, assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy.	200.91993858524856
Mr President, on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues. This time, however, I actually agree with her.	41.686403409507406
Whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path, I cannot say. Nevertheless, I would like to commend her on her work.	91.06689036976601
The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex, as we and Mrs McCarthy, as rapporteurs for the general regulation, had asked.	52.69952928393558
Unfortunately, this did not happen. Mr Bernié is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee.	32.940135845017615
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament' s position.	59.88901248041076
Thirdly, we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far.	54.31584911025548
They are particularly beneficial to the Member States, and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development, job creation and, more particularly, on equal opportunities and transport issues.	36.189135354847856
Personally, I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines.	104.3718690927184
As an islander, however, I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development.	30.746619643193704
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves. This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, and I have raised the issue time and time again.	36.11757519671282
Commissioner, we shall continue to raise the issue, as Article 158, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands.	49.426393451920376
Therefore, the Commission should address the issue once and for all.	66.80019051885412
The time has come to implement the programmes, and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly.	69.64305140303529
As for us in Parliament, I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May.	33.224943538424974
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes.	51.511858248739316
Mr President, Commissioner, in this minute and a half I should like, first of all, to congratulate Mrs Schroedter.	30.991506953541773
I know many have already done so, but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides, and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today.	111.76215160385176
I share the regrets she expressed, namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines, since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect, which in my view is a pity.	83.91823642508967
Consequently, I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in 2003, and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003.	86.82945137146211
In brief, I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006, which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face.	44.94858776082861
The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies.	36.53220214983407
Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking.	102.51412472483
We must ask ourselves a fundamental question: how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development?	73.1463239124004
The second challenge is that of enlargement which will, of course, have a considerable impact, both in budgetary and geographical terms.	53.978661440916916
These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us.	34.17342735899899
Finally, in this time of natural disasters, I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds.	26.525542056235828
As you know, it is up to each State to redistribute part of the total appropriation.	37.579157878299334
Europe should not be completely absent, as the states tend to want.	82.22670230819189
Public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response, even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations.	70.05856073961593
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear.	38.343462118309986
I also think we should ensure, or ask Member States to ensure, that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.	72.77389678961885
Mr President, the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form.	146.5685907326252
As far as French planning experts are concerned, for example, the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country.	44.96350771366843
Well, the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process.	49.83235465554211
Our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator.	92.76039402161713
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds.	61.86515422900762
What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax, which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level.	58.69201999210887
The Commission, however, though bound to issue guidelines, does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner.	188.05892998768473
The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere.	49.941303165520736
It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development.	28.703859290742766
This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it.	20.5995999175551
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work.	4.80066092008958
Over the coming years, faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement, Europe will, more than ever before, require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy.	118.38827043477448
To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds.	41.073583245372724
For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States.	74.11516694538336
For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.	59.71737248080638
There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission' s attention. Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided.	39.35580251511495
Secondly, a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent, since, they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated, to the point of hindering access to the Funds. This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, tend to complain.	63.05862840583411
I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that the failure of the Commission' s communication to focus on territorial pacts and, especially, methods of combating unemployment among women and young people, is cause for serious concern.	58.46244880542725
Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue, especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular.	50.56791043479562
But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.	78.59550866389803
The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often when we deal with these issues, lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability.	69.13114178033011
That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text, not to take anything away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide.	54.73949132868246
I would like to explain our thinking here.	29.128649867533586
Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.	41.165600497399346
Past experience dictates that, as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer, we should, and indeed must, demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money, hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as "value for money" indicators in the grant-giving process.	123.62167986428719
Next, we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period.	128.86140780434806
But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.	99.20112670115071
Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer, but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad.	118.7964424622803
Finally, we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed.	43.14917161090623
There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.	71.07195793412633
Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see.	136.02827624755224
That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform.	72.03667947740412
If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a "hand-up".	76.38627488421011
I urge the House to support these changes.	27.631827981573124
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report, which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work.	14.825210100462199
The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions.	46.837111657046606
Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment.	96.5425151052465
These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines.	152.23631495261876
Let us not forget that when these policies are effective, they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life.	93.13308426164363
Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland.	35.728603134285926
In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best.	51.862154560191414
Mr President, Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that.	21.0678932483508
However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community' s regional policy.	33.89167059719641
Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it.	88.33507690723674
The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South.	46.47836212399897
Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States.	52.87692447456771
If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report, we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities.	55.521395751858805
Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.	126.8057179918166
The Union' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy.	33.20965866875441
A large section of the Union' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots.	83.16264774902145
Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.	59.46028149729112
Mr President, I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union.	32.01617870962678
The first is the fundamental, central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion.	22.128805974028566
We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously.	80.67098362155733
We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union' s fundamental objectives.	21.7817471085569
Secondly, I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention.	27.816987001046478
In future, we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as, in my country, the islands of the Azores and Madeira.	36.43850757232068
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission' s report on the outermost regions, which has been long awaited by Parliament?	21.68604525195096
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made.	32.10518378237968
Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes.	50.44519352681349
However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.	68.88727452159966
Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities.	222.93853693605647
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.	119.82246860126855
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10, to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.	42.77015472902804
I should be very grateful, Mrs Schroedter, if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations.	98.94040585520021
Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.	38.85103533282572
Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion, despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how, in fact, these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from Europe' s most highly-developed regions.	71.91172048715951
They are growing, but only in terms of GDP.	73.63004717903007
They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions.	63.88864751870123
Commissioner, please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority, because this is our citizens' greatest problem.	44.95880182040826
Please take account, in strategic terms, in the revision and in the allocation of reserves, of employment needs, because this, fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require.	113.51971350340457
Mr President, it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation, particularly for women and young people, and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.	50.07402721272996
It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas, employment in rural areas, aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which, of course, comprise half of the islands of the Union, as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty.	54.76455481536883
Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable.	136.95011004069252
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments, occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Schroedter' s report.	28.60363320255796
Everyone understands, Mrs Schroedter, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons and the time limits involved - and I shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limits or delays, since we are discussing this report right now, as the representative for the Commission, I consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000-2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming.	58.581325813013066
Mrs Schroedter, you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the Member States and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters, European Union cofinancing of the programmes requires, and is the justification for, a situation where Community priorities as debated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out.	57.603516833708035
So, ladies and gentlemen, I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you, Mrs Schroedter, and the various Members of this House, have made.	62.23574231919275
Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines, Mr Hatzidakis, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1, 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds.	88.57726966661181
This means putting forward the Commission' s priorities, based on past experience in implementing the programmes, as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations.	83.01086796346934
The objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use, to the optimum and efficient use, as some of you have wished, of Community involvement, including, Mr Bradbourn, using, if necessary, the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public monies.	100.29120487420519
When I speak of optimum utilisation, I am referring both to the national and regional levels.	62.93681764186844
And so, Mr Seppänen, I shall also mention at this point, speaking of the national level, the link with the Cohesion Fund.	53.68352386725189
This is the purpose of these guidelines.	16.609426221621856
Regarding their content, as you know, ladies and gentlemen of this House, they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but, at the same time, very passionately, as I understood her presentation just now.	83.04586641637552
The first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create, in all sectors, but especially in the private sector, as Mr Berend said, the maximum number of serious, worthwhile and permanent jobs, the competitiveness of regional economies, all regional economies, and in particular, Mr Evans, that of Wales, but not only of Wales.	72.73951592706838
And, because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission, let me also add the regional economies of the European regions handicapped by their distance from the centre, be they remote regions, island regions or, of course, the most remote regions which are, naturally, the most distant.	99.78028314563703
Perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro, who asked me about this, that, as I wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions, the Commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report.	109.03136669468813
Concerning the most remote regions, it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments, but this is not necessarily an excuse, just an explanation.	49.760574123761835
We must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work.	50.35477095262146
I myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 November and, within the College, we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions. I would thank you for your understanding in this matter.	67.0352308736962
So that is the first priority, the competitiveness of regional economies.	39.02177097318977
The second priority, which several of you have stressed, Mr Puerta in particular, but there were others, not that I am mentioning them in any order of priority, is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment, particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past.	92.83004069733133
Ladies and gentlemen, we now have a European Union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great, proving the effectiveness and worth of the Cohesion Fund, but where, at the same time, in relation to unemployment - as you wrote, Mrs Schroedter - an increasing gap exists between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest or most disadvantaged regions. This is a situation which is, as it should be, unjustifiable and intolerable.	99.45347635338457
As far as I am concerned - taking into account my own concept of the construction of Europe and regional development policy in particular - this is a situation which I find unacceptable and I have every intention, as far as possible, with your support, of dedicating all the appropriations for which I am responsible to this improved social, human and territorial cohesion, particularly in order to prevent what I once called in this House a two-speed Europe, a Europe of wealthy districts but, at the same time, a Europe of impoverished areas.	65.97102695377612
The third objective is urban and rural development, within the scope of a balanced territorial policy.	49.85674034848045
In fact, the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account. The first is rural development, and let me say, Mrs Schroedter, that I am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport, an issue I have been involved in personally for a long time.	102.11543387245587
I particularly remember the time when I was Minister for the Environment in my own country. The second principle is that of equal opportunities, particularly for men and women, as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union.	37.52323805485418
Finally, and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this House, particularly yourself, Mrs Schroedter, in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies, for development or redevelopment, which, of all the priorities, offer the maximum opportunity to synergy, to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership. You expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership, yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines.	98.64856654314875
However, I do wish to mention - since you have asked me to do so - that, as far as I am concerned, this partnership - and I spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely - is a tool, one used to involve local brainpower, be it in the public sector, in the form of elected representatives, the social and educational sectors, associations, or in the private sector; a decentralised partnership, and let me mention in this connection, in response to Mrs Angelilli, the territorial pacts, which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership.	75.74367238199866
These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities, since they must be taken into consideration, under each of the objectives, to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions.	49.803183561259424
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made, ladies and gentlemen, and firstly on procedure.	44.970497785378456
It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date.	55.540619685651485
Let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission, in the form of a draft in February 1999, in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text, my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, presented them to Parliament immediately.	51.124469069997474
Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time, however, Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted, in July 1999.	89.26692433057774
Here in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, among you, I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned, your observations will certainly be taken into consideration.	61.25257993963743
And let me assure you, furthermore, that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind, in line with the regulations, then the point of view of this House, as expressed in this report, will also be taken into account.	50.911071458253346
Now to the form. On the subject of the role of the guidelines, Mrs Schroedter, you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives, often very precise ones, should be provided.	75.22095145617972
I shall not list them all, but they include implementing intersectoral policies, increasing efficiency in the use of public funds, assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together, etc. The Commission takes note of these, but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents, such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document.	130.56727844331505
Drawing to a close, I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated, Mrs Schroedter.	54.10053155969049
I am thinking, for example, of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations.	42.32620463816281
This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring' s negotiations.	60.134077290301995
The Commission kept to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulations, which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad, indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed Community policies.	88.1343859285119
I actually quoted the text itself, in quotation marks.	240.28113078602829
Moreover, the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes.	90.91243179181758
You then mentioned, Mrs Schroedter, the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development, pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration.	105.38767590382118
I find the opposite the case.	82.30837545438393
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attaches, and shall attach, to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy.	89.13600294014816
Indeed, I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere.	118.53468429043974
As regards rural development, which a number of you brought up, particularly Mrs Redondo Jiménez, the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur: a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas, but also protection of the environment and Europe' s rural heritage.	104.25264242253408
It must, however, be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds, whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority.	82.4166131985701
And indeed, on the subject of the balance of rural society, let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section, aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture.	70.00776783656794
At this stage, I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas, in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section is for Objective 1 regions.	37.062451926113674
In any event, I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter.	25.48541911419799
Before concluding, I should like to tell Mr Savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck France, Austria and Germany, in particular, in the last few weeks, and at the same time we shall once again be discussing, together with my fellow Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of France.	49.13984672956101
I shall therefore reserve the right, if you permit, sir, to give you my own opinion, which, to a great extent, matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using Objective 2.	114.11752864935171
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow.	81.47084202484308
We shall then have an appropriate tool for working, particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms.	37.642932389852064
Indeed, this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the storms.	92.90346077594336
In conclusion, with thanks for your understanding, Mr President, I should like to thank you, Mrs Schroedter, for the quality of your work and that of the committee, and to tell you that I am very pleased, apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines. We have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view.	37.51829111186089
I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines, which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes.	49.771383260727205
This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes. I feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions, at this time when programming for the period 2000-2006 is being undertaken, good joint working practice, which is, Mr Hatzidakis, backed up by something I am very attentive to: observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions.	105.40219995215577
The debate is closed.	3.77548916318001
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	3.2691741867479744
Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union	23.59413925223989
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)].	6.835214064656632
Mr President, Commissioner, this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report.	29.54567740130394
I consider, however, that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.	121.39137300488376
The Commission report generally relativises this observation, particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest, by which I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the most remote regions.	44.23473101469249
In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	34.38831634448528
Finally, in my view, this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe, particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions.	60.241701594725164
Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.	93.26253848378802
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Berend has just presented and congratulates the author, both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility, which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee.	43.68042464101231
It must be remembered that, currently, the European Union' s overall competitiveness is, in general terms, 81% of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units, that is the regions, also improves. Furthermore, this is at a time when technological development, economic globalisation and our problems, which are enlargement and the single currency, demand that the regions, as well as businesses and individuals, make more of an effort to be competitive.	96.19566703977748
The European Commission' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions.	176.39035257276734
I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur, one positive and one negative.	101.9704820898906
The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major, although not decisive, factor in reducing regional inequalities.	43.06338670037924
The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.	93.19154526122921
It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation.	63.88170199456651
This, Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period.	56.21640735586964
Thus, Mr President, I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as other speakers have done, to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006.	37.49287786879522
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.	17.35790485177765
The sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union' s regional policy aims.	45.34608762332476
The report shows that growth has been uneven, despite all our efforts.	45.964382021419844
Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe.	107.76686801502737
The strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average, whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly.	158.64446819065154
We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas.	78.26128704767636
Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences, long distances, climates that are too cold or too hot, sparse populations and austere conditions?	163.6335615567059
How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development?	55.9695309874835
It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union' s more remote areas.	32.37898939599099
The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility.	18.141993983890504
Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased.	100.87518617283801
This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced.	93.66479915566067
In the future, we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.	43.84191379594911
For example, uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration.	43.09799049449654
In this connection, too, weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development.	64.9146784640459
It is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how.	139.10583182981472
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report.	24.882737019178606
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union' s regional policy has, until now, not been able to interpret, in any significant way, the existing differences in our inhabitants' incomes.	53.539534896626265
We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today, there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty, as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached, on average, 23.7% in the regions worst affected, regions which also happen to be poor areas, whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment, corresponding to the richer areas, unemployment stands at just 4%.	74.36899461293726
Given this situation, the report approved by Parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment: measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes, which are often misspent, with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems, with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the Trans-European rail Networks, which are due in 2007.	70.48209429892347
There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries' agriculture and fisheries, which are often harmed by the European Union' s own insensitive policies, as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs, particularly for women and young people. Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality, which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects.	55.677948947960346
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Berend' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore.	41.87531978041131
The overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation, boosting equality of opportunity, increasing the sustainability of employment and development, are only mentioned in passing.	85.4551238717539
This attitude appears to me to be unjustified. I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report.	36.03048435920802
This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness, particularly as I myself am an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 Region, that is in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises.	37.45154885653394
It is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the Objective 1 Regions, that is to say job creation measures, special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business.	82.81666542792706
They are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities.	83.10913067130937
Supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development, simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these Objective 1 Regions.	73.75064177866246
After all, the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 3% in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all.	93.70951734663058
Concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer.	207.44703632967943
And those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and, to a lesser extent, in rationalisation.	66.28932372061347
It is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas.	40.46269041960394
The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions.	83.72266963230716
In other words, what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there.	40.23426823494654
For example, these would be measures for vocational training, for further education, for re-integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process, for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements, in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again.	69.3300041827146
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report.	27.123299117616185
The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union.	19.027289043523414
By stimulating a diversity of investments, the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment.	36.56139215703323
From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect.	55.625936599834375
The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase, not really a satisfying result over a period during which, certainly over the past couple of years, there has been economic growth.	55.296368286264716
As indicated by the rapporteur, the effects of the structural measures, on the other hand, are minimal as far as employment is concerned.	30.871124130179993
Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for.	66.84731744529684
Also, the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions.	123.99969691881262
Mr President, it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities, especially in connection with boosting employment.	60.26643931232111
It is, after all, they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit.	106.1252923581783
By allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and, if necessary, tying this in with financial aid, a higher return can be achieved.	98.4565980204434
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.	41.829229740780896
I am therefore in favour of the Commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions.	26.89137237885614
Following on from this, it is probably also more meaningful, with regard to the financial aid to regions, to give Member States more say anyway.	114.39893097912459
By shifting the criteria from the regions to the Member States, we can avoid a great deal of problems later on.	55.70917969800973
Finally, I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries.	12.756370065392652
The report shows that, in general, they are a long way behind EU countries, especially in terms of GDP per capita.	41.70581843120258
With the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future, it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy. I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later.	29.03161920279502
Mr President, Commissioner, following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part.	83.54285435017762
For example, whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased, there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect.	35.516184327840705
Equally, unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all, indeed they rose in some cases.	107.63211220086892
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently.	31.54445736726855
Even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries.	38.97450984871043
Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment, then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development, improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training.	77.15097065703331
Genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base.	85.62398795336092
If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term, then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.	59.93589335992044
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate.	26.740265020429185
Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report, because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work.	40.721340851057555
This issue, which has an impact on their everyday life, is a key issue as regards EU credibility.	83.05651932606052
It has to be conceded that the EU has already aided, I would say quite magnificently, the development of poor countries.	32.585927384988175
I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago.	80.15067268045202
In this connection, French speakers would speak of a "coup de chapeau" : in other words, I take my hat off to the EU.	61.758487223613955
The EU really deserves such a gesture, but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great.	122.80876804156463
What is the result?	21.45174835483687
People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.	131.44389326508212
Consequently, we have to build schools, hospitals, and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over.	56.18240074044023
This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems.	58.93539033681528
Most people, however, would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised, if they were given the chance to, in other words, if there was work there.	64.3627190526296
We must give them this opportunity.	30.25125865998585
This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have.	42.22205901990042
The solution, as I see it, lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship.	168.56561120084075
By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business, but creating will.	201.32531934201404
I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life, whether he or she is an employee, the owner of a business or an official.	191.50552663905447
What is a fair society?	44.64124165565713
One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children.	150.78986731380135
In this way, positive development of the regions is also possible, because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance.	85.63954510084336
Finally, I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America, where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy, as it often is here in Europe.	57.367397072241964
Mr President, Commissioner, as my time is limited, I shall get straight to the point.	60.26715774854473
Firstly, let me make a statement of fact: the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the Union.	51.82079809900034
The most remote regions, still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates, offer one example of this.	112.10518688655542
In Reunion, for example, the rate is 37%.	66.18960850920597
This is not a situation related to the economic climate, however; rather it is a structural problem, created by our remoteness, our insularity, in short, our own specific personality.	68.68807710373005
The principle of specific, exceptional treatment was envisaged in Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to deal with such cases.	40.456970119094066
It only remains to put this principle into practice.	63.86775230235645
The Commission document expected to be ready in December 1999 was delayed until January, then February, and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism.	141.34097208295918
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission.	21.030344833428682
As regards taxation, state aid, the Structural Funds and defending our traditional products, practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency.	93.9995634626284
If these do not materialise, then, unfortunately, convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us, and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions, despite the size of the amounts committed, will end in failure.	94.1743092663639
Mr President, as all the previous speakers have done, I should like in turn to thank Mr Berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report.	27.2596222925869
Just like the previous report, this extremely competent and precise analysis, the recommendations it supports and your own comments, ladies and gentlemen, shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000-2006.	66.40745765910985
I should also like to make a few comments, firstly, Mr Berend, regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report.	32.64534511142092
You pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote, if I am not mistaken, that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports.	58.84858923347533
On behalf of all the officials of the Commission and my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this House and by yourself.	30.904012510966613
The Commission was certainly very anxious to ensure, Mr Berend, that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you.	55.335880706428945
I am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 2.1 of this report, where the Commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported, improved and influenced by factors which some of you - Mr Markov, just now, and Mrs Raschhofer - stressed very forcefully.	84.96093824445262
I am thinking of technological research and development, infrastructure provision and quality, human resources potential, small and medium-sized businesses and direct investment from abroad.	94.83027714981924
So much for the quality.	95.4565790497317
I do not wish to spend time right now, Mr Berend, going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your House has already endorsed.	127.06616891433022
Let me just itemise them: the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy, particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the Member States.	38.10095085856731
Secondly, partnership, a subject which a number of you stressed, the role of local and regional authorities, the private sector, both sides of industry, associations and local community action groups.	101.83399062950102
Regarding this problem of partnership, I shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the Structural Funds regulations are applied properly.	72.67693660982629
Thirdly, the need to develop the employment side of growth, even though I am aware, as Mr van Dam just said, that the prime responsibility is that of the Member States, and that, when we speak of the responsibility of Member States, and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy, we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in.	64.90257668348454
Mr Fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably.	46.34651573471656
Mr Fruteau, we at least need to recognise that there is growth, and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession, as has been the case in the past.	26.33281419008991
You will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike.	89.1857882709403
I agree with your analysis.	22.83943801227348
When there is growth, it must be better distributed, but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness, be they the most remote or island regions, is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades.	81.13294268624166
Fourthly, a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stressed just now, the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people.	71.28622626999963
Fifthly, the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now.	83.65423125277611
Finally, the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the Structural Funds, the motives of officials in managing these funds, even if it is occasionally complicated, and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation, follow-up and supervision of the Commission.	68.19785161107242
In relation to this, I must inform the European Parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of Structural Funds.	49.06081662883311
I should like to mention a few specific points.	11.23254239146347
Mr Berend, you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly.	81.06410868324494
Well, we are coming to an end of the zoning phase.	41.89116715499128
Tomorrow, the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy' s turn.	134.7753442805004
You may therefore be satisfied on this point, since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by Objective 2.	51.03727011220727
Regarding the informal economy you mention in your report, I am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and, as Mr Cocilovo mentioned, there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data.	40.49447065271498
To a certain extent, they are taken into account in the statistics on GDP and labour force surveys and, in any case, I wish to point out the efforts which Eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics.	45.63730348522253
Mr Berend, you also mentioned, as did Mr Aparicio Sánchez, the lack of reform in the fisheries sector.	56.35610625049869
On this point which is of personal interest to me, let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context.	40.66496251829598
This type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries, under Commissioner Fischler.	94.27328874430383
Nonetheless, I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which, no doubt, will respond better to these concerns.	42.04768537703405
Several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion, and your rapporteur mentioned some of these.	80.95297628074438
I wish to assure you, firstly, that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is, as far as I am concerned, Mr Berend, an extremely important instrument, not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner, so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated, but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of Europe and, furthermore, with the elected representatives, i.e. yourselves, on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy.	50.936786542169656
In any event, I have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report: the definition, compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe; a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned, particularly Mrs Sudre and Mr Fruteau; analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This will constitute a great challenge to us all, for you and for the Commission, in the next few years.	35.7201964993695
And finally, there are the cross-border aspects. I shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points.	61.67623281586402
Finally, I should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are, in any case, familiar with, but whose main elements I should like to reiterate.	37.43474797511565
Ladies and gentlemen, considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence, particularly for the four cohesion countries, but also frankly, Mr Pohjamo, for the Objective 2 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development, especially regarding infrastructure.	86.44603444242227
This is my first point regarding the policy.	31.641390975851447
My second point regarding the policy is as follows: the Structural Funds have made, and continue to make, a significant contribution to the convergence process.	38.69144163450164
All the macroeconomic models we are working on show that, over the last decade, more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the Structural Funds.	68.20617705226468
I have, however, taken note, particularly with regard to the most remote regions, Mrs Sudre, Mr Fruteau, and Mr Nogueira Román too, that your observation is that there is still much to do - and this is my third point regarding the policy - in terms of improving employment take-up aspects, the fight against social exclusion, which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions, and the integration of women and young people into the labour market.	42.52545162324215
Now to my fourth point regarding the policy; enlargement of the Union, the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions, the major challenge, too, for the European policy on cohesion, a point which Mr van Dam highlighted.	100.29364385509086
I shall say that something is already taking shape in Berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us.	51.7334845342833
I am thinking in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument, which I shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks.	27.41243577573354
You see, ladies and gentlemen, we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the Union' s enlargement on our structural policy.	97.90136900456248
This sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole, Mr Berend, is a good basis for our thinking, for us all and for myself.	90.60866378156483
I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines, as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006.	23.924576925421363
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	6.573406575229789
The debate is closed.	3.77548916318001
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	3.2691741867479744

Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	14.546692295191853
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	14.154465199446003
Are there any comments?	12.892326383115599
Mr President, I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes.	26.704300230406712
I refer to item 11 on the order of business.	148.82134832455486
Firstly, I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated.	36.13092486972514
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group.	31.65944112031763
The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament, as other speakers remarked yesterday, can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission.	52.68211769891586
We should also have the humility to recognise that, if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission, but also by a five-year programme, we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House, so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were.	45.22576585582701
There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this.	34.76108076456832
When there are major set-piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future, we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance.	168.6323384324726
There needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission.	59.40805010894852
We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships.	93.83283738728746
Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday, I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly.	60.32011569899619
That is something for which I have a deep appreciation.	36.81289067647954
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions.	57.595689128885304
It should not be dramatised into something more than that.	24.219950743395092
Thank you very much, Mr Cox.	11.578537685935254
I understand what you are saying.	39.61375199460919
We have taken note of this.	13.410693461431133
Mr President, concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business, we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today's agenda.	92.44987828061515
However, it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on.	58.6054376025735
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today's agenda.	32.526067207848996
Mr Wynn, that makes sense.	58.49635714970959
The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda.	25.586178840900875
Mr President, regarding Mrs Lynne's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building, I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower.	58.54630735759839
This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong.	55.299796149712876
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly, but this is a serious problem.	18.830101872609937
Mrs Ahern, we have taken note of this.	27.123506052755534
I would ask you to bring this specific case, which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor, to the attention of the Quaestors, who are, in fact, responsible for the matter.	46.83167372283526
We will also pass this on to our services, however.	89.89672559771226
Thank you very much.	10.122046454846277
(The Minutes were approved)	22.452217819019545
Reform of European competition policy	133.17823540070492
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	8.287329113573406
A5-0069/1999 by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty [COM(1999) 101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)];	6.620677027249469
A5-0078/1999 by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy 1998 [SEK(1999) 743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)];	6.111657111415198
A5-0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors. [COM(1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)] (Report 1995-1997);	11.801075483801611
A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No. 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code). [COM(1999) 94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)].	17.094178460347976
Mr President, Commissioner, today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union' s competition policy.	17.711023300418262
We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law, that is Mr von Wogau' s report, and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe.	42.45583443917748
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term "modernisation" to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper, or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression "retrograde step" .	41.15020420089038
However, we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998, and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter.	83.0141929740353
But, of course, both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper.	100.04641341827585
It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy.	27.44160020652214
On reading both Commission documents, one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed, which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us.	196.75842354590552
Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture. As the competent authority, the Commission, with its logically consistent approach, has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition, not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned.	80.21700976836429
It should continue along this path.	33.70489952442213
But, Commissioner, none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union, the deepening of the internal market, technological progress, globalisation.	60.959485112584865
Indeed, it is not just about modernisation of Community law, more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases, about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions, for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population' s acceptance, together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned.	73.7366466222295
Only, without transparency there will be no acceptance, indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency.	196.3550289170165
The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but, in fact, there is nothing that could not be further improved upon.	64.35452520111828
Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought, Commissioner, but there is one point that I would just like to go into now. Transparency and accountability belong together.	82.15517747077801
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question.	37.763737817156795
The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role, for the sake of its own independence; but Parliament is a supervisory body, and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one' s decisions than a democratically-elected Parliament, indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion?	112.41190813378294
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen, strengthening and intensifying it.	67.26801887568227
There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though. Parliament is a legislative body, but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law, of all things, is truly scandalous.	47.302756696303675
Therefore, I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area.	26.63619877258197
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases, even given the Treaty status quo.	144.82889856093257
I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures.	84.50143629556455
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions.	30.800840273257588
With all due respect for the principle of competition, competition is not, however, an end in itself.	64.70021462519767
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions.	117.93835887489635
At the end of the day, one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue.	54.30214983592108
Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts.	102.8387288272233
But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord.	160.1096783089532
Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses, monopolies law being one example.	207.0086978231726
But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation.	272.89887231318755
Competition yes, restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible.	340.0243260725395
However, since state aid forms the lion' s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like, regardless of Mr Jonckheer' s report, to say one more thing about it.	89.34702649269445
It is certainly possible, indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy.	30.079908872088506
Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes, provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition.	35.688555217197376
This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible.	54.02739454349586
It is not just that we should pillory state aid; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives.	56.3296965905969
My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party.	21.67720574506522
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties.	27.370509101195562
The Commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors, according to various typologies, such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued.	48.919708365806
Let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid, on average, for the period under review, is in the order of EUR 95 billion, corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993-1995, a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany.	70.7511045234794
To put it plainly, the level of state aid declared, roughly speaking, is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2% of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent, coincidentally, of the Community budget for one year.	99.84515432848393
This being the case, there are considerable disparities between states, which may be measured in various ways, such as, for example, as a percentage of added value and per wage earner.	64.85713004885916
I think it is also interesting to add state aid and Community aid, which may be assimilated in some way into state aid.	57.12952096496138
This clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the Cohesion Fund, among other things, which come at the top of the list.	50.15899445000185
This being the case, let me now come to the proposals made in the report.	34.326454613661745
We note, first of all, that the committee considers the data, as presented in the Commission' s annual report, to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in-depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate, sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition, pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty.	69.08072479899378
The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States.	19.36449304124649
It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided, and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect.	43.112727882266725
It is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example, has championed the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid, accessible via the Internet.	45.709391129896936
Having better, more detailed information available, particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded, must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies.	103.10706730219589
And insofar as such studies already exist, to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties, which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy, but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion.	43.17541287568585
By stressing, primarily, the quality of the information provided, our debate in committee, and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you, avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was, in absolute terms, either too high or not high enough.	81.8516659310251
Most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between, on the one hand, the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and, on the other hand, acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty, particularly, as I have said already, as regards sustainable development, research and development and economic and social cohesion.	55.20231687493085
This being the case, various amendments to the rapporteur' s initial draft report were adopted in committee, particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of results.	85.87655860876431
Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting.	54.19664670543208
Most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid, in view of the inadequacies, acknowledged or not, of private investment alone, the market failures or inadequacies of the market.	76.82992550015327
There is in particular one amendment, let me point out, concerning the energy sector, which, in my capacity as rapporteur, I see as particularly important.	102.18747538167003
I should like to conclude this presentation, Commissioner, by stressing two things: firstly, a concern of the members of the committee and, secondly, a demand of our committee.	57.28011931433364
The concern involves the pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in terms of competition policy and state aid.	25.73585070198685
This is undoubtedly a complex issue, and one where we should like to see the Commission informing us of the latest development in the matter, particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and, as far as state aid is concerned, the need, in all probability, to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors.	57.120940543678714
And finally, in conclusion, our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing, competition policy and state aid, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	48.80612260486686
As you know, Commissioner, our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid.	45.29394205460033
Mr President, Commissioner, my contribution to today' s debate concerns the steel aid code, that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission.	40.27953236501754
There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these.	87.04833732712247
The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly.	54.83068867872609
Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future.	52.4091613705904
The European Commission' s decisions, which feature in the report, are welcomed by the European Parliament, as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases, thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty.	62.24618925861644
The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission' s most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament.	40.068151770016065
As in other sectors, the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry.	31.91709244968586
According to this article, state aid is irreconcilable with the common market, in principle. Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases.	98.6806525641537
Under Article 88, the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid.	70.28921076356036
In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany.	71.4861406211647
Furthermore, the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid.	62.769581006033626
The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996.	35.243416559938346
These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular, precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether.	88.65058106785644
In addition, there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece.	46.24732788846848
However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report.	54.53384384750321
As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired.	52.08547424375761
There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code.	39.504835131766896
No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe.	74.29137358766744
This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market, regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years.	22.041619523601614
Consequently, Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry' s claims about unequal treatment, and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations.	50.021107600616006
We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind.	31.383705468008202
The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires, they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission' s supervision.	46.834599185974575
We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires, steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94, for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity.	64.91449274192675
This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code.	38.346616166871264
A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments.	82.80004177987955
What we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets.	52.25530787776909
We also need to criticise the Commission' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view, do not fall within the categories of the code, even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned.	70.66964345405646
The Commission will be called upon, in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999, to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions, thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made.	56.94723999503843
Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions, I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity, which we have ourselves created, in plenary sitting.	50.41265876790678
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the internal market is not complete.	11.289347661092807
Subsidies, monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike.	146.04215338026313
National governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time, but then it happens again.	102.16886344481092
Subsidies distort allocations, both within and between countries.	277.95335926270513
A successive phasing out of State aid is required, and more and more markets must be opened up to competition.	50.958152804090965
This applies to those which have been turned into monopolies, both private and public.	62.58437318874276
Public monopolies are, more often than not, phased out reluctantly.	81.02183182041149
Increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare, including within the spheres of education, health care and social services.	78.42715399923381
Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures.	46.63628353284365
Europe must be modernised, made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies.	52.47297629251468
Effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living.	474.2158408925623
It is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently.	83.05453912793413
In fact, competition policy and consumer policy belong together.	103.52799232514472
The internal market is the basis for our work.	21.783803702226344
Its legislation is to apply equally to all, to large and small countries alike.	125.31458254497144
A systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled.	63.557718893339704
The EU' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed.	62.87463637819576
The new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy.	57.40956647457124
In order to be effective, it must be well anchored in the Member States' national authorities.	23.085148339521957
In six months' time, it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation' s effects upon the Commission' s role.	36.939706282850366
The question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests.	88.0179255363891
This will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed.	40.26302752196042
There will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate.	61.40874676271053
The law must be correctly applied in matters of competition.	53.10130933054782
Wrongly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership, which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for.	84.41396428179085
We have a quite exciting debate in front of us.	60.50318098536173
A conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to straighten out misunderstandings, at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points.	66.568481864013
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens.	81.63272822574453
In fact, in my own constituency of Stockholm, we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies.	122.54003883927471
We would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Rapkay.	49.712762083825936
We hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law.	38.230034292089385
Mr President, as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today, even though there has been a delay.	25.355913094014685
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau, Mr Langen, Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer, as well as the Commission, for their excellent cooperation.	28.469866072832826
Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story; take the energy and telecommunications sectors, where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service.	56.450696779289906
All this is to the good of the consumer.	78.22274716023178
But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further.	43.63500059910062
The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points: dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement.	34.55944824844611
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs, at any rate.	75.738110507
At the same time, this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world, of course.	48.55194049321365
It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved; for one thing, each person will have to take responsibility themselves, and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters.	86.89493499922106
However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape.	26.845717111063784
The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement.	17.723150641380528
If we are to create a culture of law in Europe, then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission, by central bodies, but also by national authorities, by national courts.	31.79960350086851
We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally, it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty.	68.28121689170463
It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter.	43.589883609627634
The way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear, something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion.	100.69439227931268
But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy.	33.08082532716569
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted, then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined.	36.18464898859849
However, when it comes to what the future holds for competition, there are two issues dear to my heart.	54.889049902349534
One is subsidiarity.	185.6849602398358
We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency, and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions.	58.81313057112499
Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union.	50.477039232471384
I would cite, by way of example, the issue of job creation schemes, savings banks and regional banks, and Gütesiegel.	58.93294546271625
Here, a region has, by its own efforts, created a means of marketing its own products.	126.16814355080976
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention.	67.59499070636728
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation.	30.709278444986914
We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other.	45.37390294243653
My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy, although I am not going to talk about market failure just now.	45.395619826658745
I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector, but I would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters.	46.4541114759662
These days, someone who lives in an old people' s home is accommodated within the social field.	64.1016438606729
However, I could also regard them as a customer, and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field, that is evolved structures, stifle competition.	72.86021536844119
Apart from that, I could refer to any customers, any sector, as customers, and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields.	76.50073132556821
To conclude, I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity. I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes, they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe.	51.900363808347116
Thank you very much, Mr Radwan.	8.109524817298277
I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliamentary-speak, inappropriately in your case, as a maiden speech.	47.97050751327775
Mr President, Commissioner, I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member, Robert Goebbels, who is unable to attend due to a political commitment.	20.652912485980153
Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market.	16.019948154759266
A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures.	126.9409308200754
Even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market, it would not make any difference to the real world.	52.83343615875115
Economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources.	83.32761750704405
While, since the dawn of time, the market has been the key forum for human interchange, it has never been perfect.	72.51278794999683
The market favours the short term and immediate profits.	96.6091047542685
On the market, the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties, consumers and workers.	79.26037835615004
In order to function, the market needs rules.	97.21873352965835
The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society.	62.17707024272805
We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose.	54.905881810703924
The market is not an end in itself; it must help to improve the human condition.	49.8053209278887
The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators, but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion.	80.65355998751203
Finally, aid can enable restructuring, offer training, save jobs and thus know-how.	604.4868066961311
The main objective of the Union' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid.	29.487394579733028
This aid must be aligned with the objectives of the Union, particularly economic and social cohesion, sustainable development and research.	28.94515802289336
The Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market.	42.97403245636101
It would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid.	31.964124129114243
The Internet is not a product of the market, but the result of research financed by the American army.	37.01516332045219
The World Wide Web, which has enabled the meteoric development of the information society, was developed by CERN in Geneva, once again with public aid.	70.31354796034297
The German Government' s intervention to save the Holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy.	48.224278541427864
President Duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness, the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism.	64.67004892536775
I did not hear Mr Duisenberg criticising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the hedge fund, LTCM.	42.06440028908617
Wishing to save 60 000 jobs is, apparently, a sin against the market, but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market.	74.7302329461202
Public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation, as was the case in Mexico, Asia and Brazil.	38.189877577111815
Human labour, on the other hand, is considered to be a simple factor in the equation.	32.88581063110934
We Socialists reject the liberals' naïve optimism on this point.	59.034141149418474
We want a true culture of competition in Europe.	47.618389599410264
The state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge.	89.51564154298909
Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation.	19.553835814862655
I want to thank you, Commissioner Monti, for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that, as we enter the new millennium, you have an especially important role.	37.59140760579967
It is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments. These may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy, but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless.	60.32727807945682
Let me mention the latest examples we have seen: Holzmann, a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government; sawmills in former East Germany; and, especially, aid to shipyards.	80.70703518126848
These are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets.	54.94487940758355
I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and, to that extent, are helping to undermine the value of the euro.	26.1107965654176
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee, all concerning state aid.	32.82542304858879
These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness, which is very important with a view to making the internal market work.	48.15335628205237
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	7.098140914434645
As I say, our amendments concern transparency, and I should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the Commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful, specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be.	48.335184906488976
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful.	53.45432102082666
How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back?	55.88483293223724
At present, there are no common rules in this area, and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment.	39.06534503841139
This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition.	27.160734778730323
Finally, we propose keeping both a register, as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs, and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid.	76.64612627160285
You have shown us the way, Mr Monti, with the single market scoreboard.	86.02410209310918
It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid.	43.62208149557716
I very much hope that you, Commissioner Monti, will support these amendments, and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter.	37.65919819444045
To conclude, I want to welcome the Commission' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy, on which, once again, a good deal of work has been done.	27.441665632473427
But, as I have already mentioned, our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness.	91.14247961784884
There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid.	44.89470497699005
This is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, and I should like to thank Mr Jonckheer who, in his report, has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria, as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition.	39.74874726554839
As Liberals and Greens, we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look, but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives, and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems.	71.8206691689356
Mr President, Commissioner, there are just two questions which must be answered.	29.223851792470473
Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy, and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy?	125.67308447771775
Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid.	62.1474289728392
It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements.	120.21953326085249
So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified.	133.80439490630283
The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level.	118.81094486627404
We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything.	38.41598848077689
We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact.	70.62036060103733
Mr President, once again we are debating the European Union' s competition policy.	16.12721600329199
But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us.	42.25648041994987
The overriding features of today' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational groups.	156.2463674567679
Should we not be discussing this issue?	46.59959429705741
We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies.	72.57162693166909
Certain sectors of European industry, such as the shipbuilding industry, air transport and the steel industry, which have been hard hit by existing competition policy, have suffered tremendously.	80.06247399044466
They have lost their status, and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant.	34.03098758731229
When will we debate that?	369.5525528879386
The scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states, and Member States of the Union at that.	161.10472430064266
And yet, we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with public-sector corporations as state aid.	104.70709869302249
At the same time, unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.	13.610002966627505
Workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights.	80.52394334514533
Consumers see their standard of living being eroded, poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismantled and dissolved in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition, in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business.	78.24430924968271
We consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it.	62.09627177034322
Mr President, Commissioner, in the course of this pivotal year, prior to the changeover to the single currency, the Commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment.	31.292783391554682
The competition policy has, as far as these resources permitted, contributed to this event.	92.37258808250279
For our part, we remain staunchly opposed to the single currency which, far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency, imprisons us in an artificial straitjacket, which has been imposed on the peoples of Europe.	62.405544000098985
Having said that, governing means planning. It also means being responsible and, in this new context which has been forced upon us, competition law naturally has an essential role to play.	131.6983585209509
In this area, the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action: acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-competitive practices, by refocusing its departments' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest Community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law.	151.29178732577358
As regards state aid, it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex, and the introduction of a public register, where all aid would be recorded, does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints.	89.5973767470207
Finally, on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction.	36.43688302411921
The Commission is, in fact, retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities, but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all.	48.120796677224945
National states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control.	73.25026701583897
In conclusion, I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction, we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which, if it were realised, would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states.	37.83263292995228
Mr President, Commissioner, we have a basically positive view of the Commission' s White Paper on competition, particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation, but we are also puzzled by several things.	39.55146629322843
First of all, there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers, though necessary in many ways, will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives, and that some people will be tempted to use competition law, not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails, of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets, but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves, or even for protectionist purposes.	63.434823040584234
In this respect, we should heed the words of von Eieck, and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni, who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies.	53.02919441252656
State interference in the economy is, even today, still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market, competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers.	71.33845698663079
There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this, there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of stock exchange capitalisation; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vodafone' s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann.	65.35156821295926
Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state, ranging from state television, which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer, and the Post Office, to some compulsory insurance schemes, including health and social welfare systems, which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option.	101.37566427173594
Commissioner, I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties, but I believe that, it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy, especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition.	40.9965087182984
What is being done may well be very important, but it is still not sufficient.	40.395159553315224
Mr President, a White Paper, by definition, is not something you can take or leave.	81.3574450584625
It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that.	54.97349699570314
It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense.	48.024990273216986
I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views.	92.24489699506452
I also assume that you, Commissioner, want to honour the reputation of, and the work put in by, your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective.	74.38754349948185
I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner, but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless.	108.3020030083174
Firstly, these relate to the coherence of the policy' s application.	58.446728253110685
In general, I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market.	32.469057272079475
The internal market needs a uniform competition policy, not only in terms of concept, but also in terms of application.	51.059603705631524
It is true, there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way.	48.06093397403404
The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities.	42.81495407815118
But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward.	40.96409031784149
So, I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible.	79.25508733165873
Secondly, I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty.	54.57856264143249
Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern.	74.20622556624959
This instrument will fall by the wayside in future.	39.67684525453176
In the White Paper, you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines, but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next?	122.12051822230126
Thirdly, I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy.	59.580534050255665
I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection, as is already the case, one has got to admit, within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector.	85.54045238189346
Fourthly, I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules.	42.99863968322991
Fifthly, with the pending enlargement, I wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game.	92.93354522522803
They are still in training, as it were.	91.59825173806337
What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market?	43.49542349198262
Sixthly and lastly, I would remind you of a point that I have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions, namely the legal privilege of company lawyers.	54.63239603996202
If the Commission implements the White Paper objectives, it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable.	83.86791223097308
Is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege?	118.19440406975461
Commissioner, I am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and I hope that, in this sense, we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain sterile but can bear fruit.	43.159336921531754
Mr President, I would like, in beginning my speech regarding the White Paper, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau.	21.018229426298756
The fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure.	28.60836642261655
We are, therefore, in agreement with the report, Commissioner, as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper.	21.803683724672457
Since the Treaty entered into force, Community law on competition has been one of the tenets of Community policy.	36.11887549636367
After almost forty years of being in force, these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion. For this reason, modernisation was essential.	139.6190492369837
That modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons. Firstly, the authorisation system; secondly, decentralised application; thirdly, procedural rules; fourthly, judicial application; and fifthly and finally, excessive red tape.	296.2365512154363
The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform, as was unanimously requested by specialised companies, academics and lawyers.	170.80840797651422
I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system.	61.14207092148842
A system, such as the current one, which is capable of making so few decisions, be they approvals or prohibitions, is something less than a valid system.	91.7788173457419
National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81(1) and 82 for some time.	95.97633935271132
However, they could not apply Article 81(3), which, to a certain extent, prevented the coherent application of Article 81(1).	95.70410357038749
You will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the Court of Justice, both brought by German courts, which question the feasibility of applying 81(1) without being able to apply 81(3).	131.70017969500222
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary.	67.17740142267253
The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762.	51.94978437493605
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous.	83.61056371071813
The fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure, that it did not establish time limits, that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files, or that the right to defence was not properly recognised, were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform.	87.9439631360815
The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994, the Commission published a communication on this subject.	39.85838412156015
It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach.	29.360685549972978
One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape.	58.66362053112419
As a consequence of the continental legal tradition, consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market.	128.85956444030788
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis.	32.29250491719148
The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals.	34.72208422230394
It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report.	28.850815842731325
Amongst these, firstly, is the fact that, despite trying to modernise Articles 81 and 82, Article 81 and not Article 82 carries exclusive weight.	171.60019969364126
At the moment, with inter-company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them, the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important.	150.97109780633266
Secondly, Regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation.	43.12148637357939
For these reasons, we are going to vote in favour of the report.	13.169367589209667
However, if some of the amendments are accepted, particularly those presented by the PPE-DE Group, we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document, lacking in rigour and, in that event, we would reconsider our support.	60.11162961187652
Mr President, amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate, I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Berenguer, that is to say, the modernisation of competition policy, which is the subject of the Commission' s White Paper.	24.328232714165097
Frankly, I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory.	66.20845350529802
Through his management, Commissioner Monti achieves good results, as did his predecessor and, clearly, he has established a guarantee which, in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market, has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the Union may work adequately, without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged, as has happened in the European Union since 1993.	84.36104986825873
If it functions well, if we are satisfied, if the Commission has basically acted correctly, why the need for the modification?	86.2285396465067
Various arguments have been presented in its favour.	97.80231112096023
Mr Berenguer made a very accurate analysis, justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition, but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States, are truly identical in all regions.	56.38672255271481
Because, if this is not the case, we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market.	39.538257343449786
In that event we would not have moved forward, but rather backwards, in the application of competition policy in the Union.	39.073793662846555
Mr President, I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union, when compared to previous reports.	22.822890156949022
I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way.	20.274407162390517
I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the Basque Country, which I represent - a margin for action, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity.	21.410549790841678
Nevertheless, I cannot forget the numerous criticisms, both from Member States and from market operators, which, given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the Commission in its evaluation of specific cases, maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment, the planning of company mergers etc.	100.85724608145873
The only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval, through individual cases, which will take more than six or eight months to resolve, an excessively long period, which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility, affecting the generation of wealth and employment.	93.54089708826366
I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations, lay down clear rules, which will benefit all of us: businesspeople, investors, workers and the citizens in general.	97.22276671621778
Mr President, I would like to stress that, in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future.	42.94145289777252
From the point of view of economic growth, and therefore of increasing employment and wealth, safeguarding a competition policy in the Member States is becoming a crucial factor, and one that is certainly very important for our future.	37.14274657379565
This is why I give this report my full support.	35.338537049833114
Recently, I have noticed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner, precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility, both for products and for services.	56.010752975834734
I would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future, for Europe' s economy, and, above all, for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general.	25.458746422543705
Mr President, for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union.	48.61877815664809
It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined.	136.21904323559272
The truth is that the single market is not yet complete.	21.34020071417691
During my six months as a Member of this Parliament, I have become acutely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project.	52.85903839264834
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe.	66.61176071653477
But all this, in effect, is so much rhetoric when we look at the national, regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market.	58.509468440116066
That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission's proposals.	20.159337750828463
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti.	20.98111968239584
We look to him as the man to root out cartels.	84.58875693946385
But he would recognise that, as for everybody else, we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination. That is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr von Wogau.	41.870637614552884
I want to congratulate him, sadly in his absence, for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side!	53.63162282286206
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support.	71.80741689414849
So although I may not share his conclusions, I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address.	56.41684435407511
The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy.	24.831556598302555
I know that the Commission is set against this, but the potential exists.	39.27993786040543
I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities.	48.96344220387819
I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process.	49.731207911254955
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation.	70.49584150836809
Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court.	33.270221649507455
Well, we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment.	52.36989081168048
We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment, in which we have the support of the Commission.	32.15142710343458
Unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point, in the Factortame case, in which the British Government was the defendant, it took ten years for the European Court to give a ruling.	49.10993355074964
So, judicially, something needs to be done.	46.00419051718366
I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area.	40.16069322145276
In relation to legal certainty, I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen.	26.62592554059044
It is important that business has legal certainty.	37.2276084160703
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently.	146.6955647605204
He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers.	72.09238197225852
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom.	40.16407335825089
We all have, as it were, our histories to live with, but it is important that business has legal certainty.	60.94251191135722
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business: a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy.	62.994194061582654
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change.	36.32407190914227
We have been told how, currently, people's time is being wasted and that the changes, therefore, could be beneficial.	64.45159877537634
But I really feel that, in the circumstances, we want to know what the implications would be for business.	46.40657751518261
Finally, we, as British Conservatives, are looking for a change in direction, towards the development of an independent competition authority.	67.87757579444873
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that.	15.864654343987642
Mr President, the European Union' s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration began.	37.8579063952007
It is an integral part of the tension, inherent in the very concept of European integration, between solidarity and cooperation between Member States, with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy, and competition, which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the European Union as an entity.	34.86258709966915
It is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies.	20.64089640599879
We can be proud of a European competition culture, for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality.	83.10837771380814
We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision.	112.92438390660217
However, we must be vigilant in the face of global operators, against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits.	63.238062580184014
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vivienne Forestier, who described the state of the world in terms of the economy' s reign of terror.	22.8706938863955
Society is surrendering itself to the economy.	48.88010394701967
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union.	15.83206064463705
We are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practices are being held in check, not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan, or others, until we get the international competition law we so badly need.	116.585792081462
European competition policy, as we very often forget, is not just important for fair competition as such, but also for prices, growth and employment, and hence for the public.	117.48505907265778
In common with the other Members, I call for Parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned.	89.29493701249108
It is essential that this long overdue step be taken.	68.38620268655038
It is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection.	26.23742640299591
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament, as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations, consumer protection associations and the public.	31.794918407171433
Greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy.	59.157057805907066
Then it is possible to understand that, for example, lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to European competition policy, and Brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are, of course, bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context.	70.57400615557066
It is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement.	38.761899842320354
Emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis.	76.56276973230973
At the same time, it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose, with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering Community objectives.	36.17315952573039
A word on the White Paper: the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy.	59.63931534712291
I am opposed to this, unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group, because I believe that, in competition policy terms, the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met, and I believe there is a threat of renationalisation.	63.07736398691807
The system currently in force creates transparency, affords enterprises legal certainty and has, without a shadow of a doubt, led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement.	140.48313315680002
The problem of overwork highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system.	37.52244184819974
Indeed, it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty.	71.56966905355296
Mr President, I am very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so.	58.559820771447946
The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions.	57.603352028960174
For example, the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the European area was EUR 1.4 trillion, which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in 1990.	63.803221347735885
This poses enormous challenges for competition policy, which I hope it will be able to meet because, for certain, many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale.	89.24734621603902
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices.	68.25553265562586
Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the European element, and, particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that.	46.18175736781875
Mr President, in the limited time I have, I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here, in particular by Mr Jonckheer, who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid.	40.171457025928746
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82, especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration.	56.137625951897995
As a Member for the Basque Country, I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market.	30.058975061140078
I say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the Commission in general, and Mr Monti, in particular, for its persecution of the incentives to Basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid.	57.208657737062325
Our discrepancy stems from the fact that the Commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co-responsibility of our arrangement which gives our Basque fiscal rules the same nature, foundation and aim as the rules of the Member States of the Union, and that they are applied in a general way to all tax-payers who, by virtue of points which fall under an external system of law, are subject to those rules.	73.37209385768331
Mr President, Commissioner, competition is exactly what we need.	37.24766414362909
We need competition if there is the least unemployment, for a smooth-running healthcare system, for social justice, for high social standards, and, of course, we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products, equal market access conditions for all enterprises, and environmentally-friendly products.	122.96997171590887
In other words, we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics.	44.27584936316212
I often have the impression, unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded, that very often the reverse is the case; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics.	132.56701601371
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this.	29.58122991306168
But a system cannot function in this way: it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand.	113.5926505971217
I will give you an example: the European Union was right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg, although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained.	88.81229154745058
But these are competitive jobs, for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany.	152.0803947923214
Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too.	82.6863324122794
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is designed to achieve.	19.467866972064495
If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics.	40.26950767470333
Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people' s social welfare and boost purchasing power.	98.15715199459764
To that end, we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply.	77.3004395745038
Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today.	53.80712653849593
I would like to quote verbatim from the report: "State aid per capita is highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland. Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together."	110.03227325330415
I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures.	40.53730193606944
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation.	75.38903776247241
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus. This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe.	35.63493894743239
Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper.	34.81314152504291
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40% and a top-up of 15% for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000.	123.55974165747574
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace.	136.04371459769368
No other Member State is at such a disadvantage.	61.92288237223218
Mr President, the monopolies' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe.	56.537950864107806
The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies' ban to be unsatisfactory, something I would wholeheartedly agree with.	66.98132778935303
But opinion differs as to the solution.	116.34893126911332
The Commission' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation.	69.84195430890377
In other words, we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse.	33.76263846477776
Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system.	116.37595291992612
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law.	31.75775779110423
We would be changing the law to make it executable again, which is something I consider to be unacceptable.	55.12874187283908
The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions.	67.70030950680953
Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption, insofar as the provisions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty on European Union allow.	79.04660029379852
The requirement to lodge applications in Brussels will be dropped; in other words, the Commission will be completely in the dark in future.	38.38734954208756
This is unacceptable to my mind.	26.621037940434938
The Commission' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States' courts.	31.995621331885058
But if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy.	39.635017617715626
This is unacceptable in my view.	21.365589163491713
It would weaken a key element of European policy.	43.95957049108909
The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned.	63.37363045893999
There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition.	134.92967071113944
In any case, the Commission' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties.	31.898659646170895
There was no majority for this at the time.	42.65423737319624
Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time, it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy.	90.74771951390562
Forty years on, this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies, to the detriment of Europe' s consumers.	34.37066063412704
I consider this to be unacceptable.	29.880399495707394
Mr President, in this important debate on competition, I am speaking this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen' s document on the Steel Aid Code.	33.12005526124824
As the Court of Justice recognised in 1996, the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances.	48.78336733499813
Indeed, several years ago, this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector.	31.358073555687067
This is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses, even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty.	34.272792770181276
This indeed, is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code, but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.	42.20892425042747
It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research, development, environmental protection and cases of company closure.	53.562120625487374
In the same category of ideas, it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies.	51.268355376293194
The Commission suggests shorter deadlines.	62.271542247154336
I agree with this request.	16.35535596478291
Like the rapporteur, while I am pleased with the Commission report, nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid.	28.044531012334065
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the Code.	62.579061439439315
In the interests of equality, either the Code must be applied or it must be modified.	55.58295697615631
Finally, and in conclusion, Mr President, with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the regulations will have to be reviewed since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002, and in that case I am in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area.	36.1745480732608
We therefore await, and I await, the European Commission' s proposals on this matter.	22.781323103389425
Mr President, I am also going to refer to the report by Mr Langen, which concerns aid to the steel industry.	22.853665686639047
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues.	16.055979321966497
Firstly, I agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all Member States and, secondly, on the need for transparency with regard to this aid.	33.54032612603403
We agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that, despite the rules laid down in the sixth Steel Aid Code, the Commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that Code.	39.478302187017086
However, the thing that worries us most, Mr President, is the decrease in prices, by 30%, owing to imports.	150.4351601387994
The reason for this decrease is unfair competition from South Korea and Taiwan, in the case of steel, as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid.	63.65899350599734
Orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically, resulting in a loss of jobs.	99.63684066774776
I live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems: Asturias.	94.1764647699119
With global markets, we need global employment laws and global subsidies.	333.68385923647674
I know this is difficult to achieve now, but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers, here and elsewhere, and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries, here and elsewhere, it will be difficult to preserve jobs in Europe and outside it.	55.0041490096848
Mr President, Commissioner, Director-General, I would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von Wogau report: I welcome the Commission' s open-minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules, and to propose practical reform measures.	41.810883692634484
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von Wogau, who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification, indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken, and pulls no punches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion.	51.90740509820322
The White Paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection, discussion, and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves, the judiciary, the Member States, and above all the SMEs concerned, that need to be clarified.	57.73507133393352
Competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy.	54.80731975314183
However, it must be "europeanised" taking into account the principle of subsidiarity.	16.869196771788705
I also welcome, therefore, the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual, without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility.	63.42212011872906
In practice, only 9 cases were rejected, 94% of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished, non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines, which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-related, staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement	108.09485704852304
To conclude, I would like to tell you what I am expecting from this reform: fair competition and equal competition conditions, legal certainty for all enterprises, consistent application of competition policy, procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop, coordination of the national - and to me, independent - competition authorities, close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the Commission, along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and monopolies law, and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the European competition policies.	75.4322240290046
I am in suspense as to how the discussions, which were broadly based, will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal.	51.22802204275368
The Commission report confirms that, with the exception of Germany, state aid to businesses is increasing.	108.82479757007849
The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition.	42.84409728321604
As far as we are concerned, we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes.	23.591973618389503
Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business.	195.85699155532652
Take, for example, the car manufacturing sector, where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24% during the reference period.	215.28136737314335
With what aim?	625.7202159128716
Not to save jobs.	116.99243559021475
All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies.	125.64570146382061
Not to improve working conditions, for in increasing production with fewer workers, working conditions are made worse.	221.10838925300266
Did these firms need state aid to survive?	241.97395334761364
No, car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years.	89.74052878850608
State aid is not only counterproductive because, as the Jonckheer report acknowledges, it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another, but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders.	48.098383867449606
It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced, public services are being abandoned, hospitals are being closed.	128.51488950888023
In voting against the Jonckheer report, I wish to assert the need for another policy, to wit, ceasing all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff.	56.629147093159354
Mr President, today' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market.	20.2211893699775
In accordance with the principle of competition, the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94, competition policy in the strict sense, and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition.	79.5065361018515
Firstly, fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, there have been direct provisions, the code of good conduct in particular.	220.1097785383439
This has worked fairly well, but, as in the famous film Casablanca 'time goes by' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances.	124.44661860801494
In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions.	43.03956332683342
Firstly, it is necessary, in drawing up the legislation, to produce clear and complete rules.	61.07895420012529
It is probably horrendous, especially in this particular raft of legislation, that there are confused rules, regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts.	85.22837638184033
This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities.	62.139961602236774
Thirdly, it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission, in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies.	37.95011106380836
Fourthly, and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed.	71.79214727959977
We have seen this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world.	44.77774805728147
The principle of competition must now be universal in its application.	45.59476858455582
We must monitor compliance with environmental standards, employment standards, in order to prevent dumping in this area, and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid, which in many industries - as has already been said - distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own territory. To sum up, we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid, internal distortions by other countries, from being transferred to the international arena, in other words, through trickery.	83.83172787906527
Mr President, Commissioner Monti, there is much that is good in Mr Jonckheer' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors.	49.6835425422587
First of all the report reveals Parliament' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly.	36.06031375950775
Many of the report' s conclusions, however, are cause for concern, at least for our group.	87.52757345009104
For example, the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this.	53.51939579957394
Aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages, thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective, uneconomic division of Europe' s meagre resources.	161.61069020748906
The form the aid takes is important.	264.02029173618246
Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported.	81.59136088493905
For example, state guarantees, on which the Commission has just publicised its position, must naturally be considered state aid, but they are, in my opinion, a better option than granting aid directly to companies.	111.38999264688215
The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency, which affects competitiveness.	126.76255284603094
The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets.	73.21569601175712
If competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy, real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream.	58.126578701047805
Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights: we should not just be emphasising its social dimension.	53.06697293769799
The aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth, not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy.	69.86470412552825
Mr Rapkay' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law.	32.78238376136922
In my opinion, it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law.	46.767939559975176
Aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator, which will water down all the aims of competition policy.	82.36876054421388
Mr President, Mr Monti, the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the European Union, not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years, but also with a forward-looking view to the Union' s enlargement.	55.794303256783934
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts.	9.75423564972638
Moreover, I would like to say that I appreciate the remarks and observations that Professor Tesauro, Chairman of the Italian Competition Authority, sent me, and which I am sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration.	50.937199449236445
Our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market, and, above all, to achieve consistency between the different national markets. As things stand, there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the English, Italian and French markets.	80.52359777461203
There is a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which is not found in the English market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy.	54.4978405255294
Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement, which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment.	105.14638752801078
In my opinion, we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed: small and medium-sized businesses, which bind the European economy together, and social protection, which Europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy.	61.70079465415149
Safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade, pure and simple, and a system for improving people' s quality of life.	90.64232717847987
A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands, all of which must be protected.	66.38523216773203
We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries, precisely so that their economies become less peripheral.	105.25955905055793
I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed.	58.19316511786523
Mr President, competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force.	28.2016840654427
A free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition, marked by clear, uniform rules.	66.27307857614147
In his report, Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well.	23.603130164154607
But Europe is changing.	105.36421047772582
The economies are growing, we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States.	75.5294025681642
The European Commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy.	34.21387957436371
It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy.	14.44192591298833
This is not in question.	20.43971165068864
Having said this, I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation.	83.43313751340406
How will the Commission, as keeper of the Treaties, guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in London, Palermo, Helsinki and, soon, Budapest and Ankara?	68.49494251081053
This is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented, and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given.	81.62957531966391
It is not enough to say that, in the Member States, there is already 40 years' worth of experience.	30.0892047136139
In the Netherlands, the competition authority is still in its infancy.	36.29746845079217
This country has a very small market which, unfortunately, is often at the same time defined as the relevant market. This in contrast to Germany, where a very experienced Kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market.	80.17070184376817
The European Commission' s belief that, in all quarters of the Union, legislation will, almost as a matter of course, be interpreted in the same way, is what, within catholic circles, we term "foolhardy," and this is not allowed.	67.97124442834468
Uniformity needs to be worked on.	47.636535323729
Think of specialist, national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court.	155.18680329560632
This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise.	80.34306744697668
Moreover, due to the immense economic and social interests involved, we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event, as is now quite normal.	61.73466778630944
What is the Commissioner' s opinion of this?	24.039836188758
I would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses.	12.039418254574173
In order to grant small and medium-sized companies greater security, the European Commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized businesses so that, alongside vertical exemptions, horizontal exemptions will also be possible.	63.882372143804865
Through cooperation, small, independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains.	60.142794867538164
It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses.	55.965554564281895
Moreover, regarding these small businesses, we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in, the yellow card, instead of an immediate red card, which will be a large fine and will threaten the company' s very existence.	108.14600043885139
Mr President, being the last to speak gives me the privilege, Commissioner, of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total, and, I believe, justified, confidence in you at the helm of this boat. But we all want to be oarsmen on it.	70.12717791626224
We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you.	54.605648462899794
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform.	38.41924925355552
The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories.	64.92436770482945
Firstly, there is the concern that some have expressed, in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath, President of the Committee on Economic Affairs, of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the Treaty.	45.63365856913253
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed.	19.65159438026575
Secondly, we have the issue of companies' legal certainty.	78.53283421214384
It is true, Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty.	38.75873011784861
We all agree on this.	12.667650419569208
But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses, and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas, of legitimising the nature of the internal market.	26.083469362262083
On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said.	43.222182428149395
There have only been nine rejections.	72.1302746390582
But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer.	24.988047669872074
How often has a lawyer with two companies and one project, in the face of a Commission guideline given ex ante, changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules!	98.52868921898623
This is therefore an aspect to be considered.	58.495910859624715
Thirdly, we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law.	34.737940958714915
In this respect, the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon.	52.510934460000534
I believe that biodiversity is good, as is cultural diversity, but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market, that is to say, competition law.	53.6032309127166
Here improvements should be made.	108.69208767583179
Only in certain countries, Germany for example, is there specialised jurisdiction.	89.13226272308806
Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore, but we must also explore others.	42.81224907526773
What we cannot do, Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - is to give way, and give ammunition, to those who regard the European institutions as the property of the great and the good, of the rich, and not of the citizen, or the small and medium business, which, in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements, very late, with no real possibility of control apart from what the French call "le parcours du combatant", that is to say, after Lord knows how many years, when the Court in Luxembourg passes judgement, a Court which we know to be inundated at the moment.	81.36357478132534
Commissioner, it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform.	22.816546365149232
It transcends competition, it transcends the cohesion of the internal market. I believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of European integration, the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration.	40.318637127583024
Therefore, Commissioner, we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation.	59.563944796067936
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition-related subjects.	28.500502062246685
In my opinion, Mr President, this joint debate fully bears this out.	73.01470492229211
We have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order.	91.16895067485092
Our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy, a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction.	54.859796131769194
The guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy, which we shall have the opportunity to address together, aims to ensure more effective protection of competition, reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take decision-making processes closer to the European people.	86.16618775449703
I, personally, would sincerely like to thank Mr von Wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report.	27.44233952884948
I would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von Wogau report into four groups. I do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the Commission, but, on the contrary, fundamental contributions, since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome.	95.08660545114688
The groups are: the efficiency of the rules, the risk of renationalisation, consistent application of the rules and legal certainty. I will take these very quickly one at a time.	88.19526022791675
Efficiency: I am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it.	48.20198991723521
The current notification instrument, ladies and gentlemen, no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - I would remind you that, in 35 years, there have only been nine cases in which the Commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which, in the majority of cases, receive a simple comfort letter.	73.50050173436829
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions, also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements, and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges, whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals.	69.0363685200248
The question of renationalisation: first of all, although it is not really necessary, I would like to point out and stress, several times if I may, that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that, as far as Regulation 17 is concerned, there is a risk of renationalisation.	52.08608273640525
Of course we have pondered this issue, and we are still studying it extremely carefully, and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced.	48.10334957219375
At the end of the day, I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified.	24.790952861792597
The Commission proposal accords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy.	56.07555735631577
The reform does not entail any reduction in the Commission' s activities, but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers.	39.51376505585669
The reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term, used by Mrs Randzio-Plath, and, moreover, I fully agree with it - of European competition culture.	98.34830218308309
So, the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thrive, and they are certainly not all the same.	110.27735904590503
The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned, permitting greater use of Community law, which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply.	89.84033150720565
Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation, not renationalisation, of competition law.	43.61228549922548
The question of consistent application: the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind, but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated.	43.2305199539952
As with many other provisions of the Treaty, Articles 81(1) and 82 have, after all, been applied for decades by national authorities and judges, and I do not feel that this has created serious problems.	63.16501088532169
In a directly applicable exception system, consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules.	173.88876172999434
The Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework, both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice.	66.48264252269736
Secondly, we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes, and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation.	61.530299243803455
In this respect, I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen and Mr Huhne of monitoring implementation.	25.45420658843162
This then is the idea of monitoring implementation.	82.16234674294141
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up.	33.83895468018829
Though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on, it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts.	80.98343850517041
That is why the Commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application.	49.104992719225386
This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns, Mrs Peijs.	82.19573323142963
Concerning Mr Evans' point regarding the implications for businesses, it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted.	81.81245026291256
The purpose of publishing the White Paper is, after all, to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources.	61.2448696433291
We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business.	106.84218757887494
We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation.	101.87964559748794
There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance. This was raised by Mrs Thyssen, Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: the issue of SMEs.	50.55025099654426
Many speakers have underlined this.	50.17206716119785
The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs.	33.744990217735086
We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs.	70.40688506401114
Why?	1006.9559587694962
Is this simply a political gesture?	103.76482464505109
No.	1837.089500747943
In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations, as in the field of vertical restraints.	108.58848023514888
Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share.	101.84365417589295
We have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81(1).	97.78230641919514
We are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs, and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs, first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system, and secondly, by making Article 81(3) directly applicable, which will benefit SMEs in particular.	108.54991171453109
The fourth group is legal certainty.	83.58006977580094
Mr Evans, legal certainty is, of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses, not just for the legal professions, although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe.	46.54297776229528
Legal certainty is important for businesses: this is a subject, the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market, including, in this case, competition.	50.90766075367151
I am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons: by virtue of the direct effect of Article 81(3), it will permit authorisation, without a prior decision, of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions; it will create the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty.	114.4497279881157
(FR) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers.	71.75350843954602
Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982, as you know better than I. This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof.	70.34792267532106
The White Paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined: the exchange of confidential information.	58.585627768914094
The guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion.	101.78952100267145
(IT) I shall now quickly turn, Mr President, to Mr Rapkay' s report, and I would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement given to the Commission' s XXVIIIth Annual Report on Competition Policy.	30.721398187440915
We share the same basic views but the Rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully.	83.877470705151
I will mention only two, in order to be brief.	49.42920994891325
The first is greater transparency.	45.5003788195475
Parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy, as I did right from the moment I had my hearing, on 1 September, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.	49.280849756657204
As regards the international aspect of competition policy, I can confirm, Mr Rapkay, that the Commission is willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject, to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has also drawn our attention. We have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant American, Canadian and Japanese authorities as regards competition policy, and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation.	41.60190985554266
Mr Jonckheer, I would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on State aid in the European Union.	18.370937632320942
I will not talk about codecision here, but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important.	48.92246099794279
It has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition; I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion, and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	51.6187679534487
With regard to your suggestions, Mr Jonckheer, you already know that my staff, who, although short-handed as usual, are fortunately highly qualified, are working hard to produce the register of State aids and the State aids 'scoreboard' .	202.81804866860773
I am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey, which, according to the scheduled timeframe, should be being drawn up by the staff now, in January, and for adoption by the Commission in March 2000, to see whether the latest trends are confirmed.	67.50167963693896
Mr Jonckheer, Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid.	39.198611639583575
I can only say very briefly, that we are actively working with them on a practical level: they are making preparations, they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities.	75.61704240375467
I can also say, in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which, as you know, I share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental State aid.	58.077263528196625
In connection with the issue of State aid, I would also like to take up one of the points raised by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, among others regarding repayment of illegal aid.	26.721285889216873
In April 1999, the Commission adopted new Rules of Procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment.	83.58867870105745
In the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules.	63.2930878725512
Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen warmly for his report, which, although geared more towards a specific sector, is a valuable contribution.	42.660603994523285
I would like to say that, as we know, the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure, pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty, but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector.	41.652039226946776
In respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector, which will come into force in July 2002, we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied, and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this.	61.44878826767535
When we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form, I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you.	79.47761475858013
So, Mr President, I will walk away from this debate, for which I am very grateful to Parliament, in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament' s intellectual and political support, which appears to come from all sides of the House, for competition policy, its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future.	40.386916295710776
I am especially grateful for all of this.	28.761937443737523
We will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, and, at a more general level, with Parliament.	54.83421840915377
In this regard, I liked your term, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: we must all pull together, preferably in the same direction.	43.139255538608424
Competition is not an end in itself, as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out, but it plays an extremely important role in European integration.	37.6895133418062
As Mr von Wogau said at the start of the debate, at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept: it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy.	24.37809093320143
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social, as well as economic, role in the European integration process, as it has done in the past.	27.84063380259076
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.	16.769287422196612
The joint debate is closed.	10.970049441828781
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	3.2691741867479744
Protection under criminal law of the Union's financial interests	49.54243856758471
The next item is the report (A5-0002/2000) by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, containing Parliament' s recommendations to the Commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.	10.520094813943494
Mr President, year after year we learn, mainly from the European Court of Auditors' test reports, that money is lost to the budget of the European Union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage, mismanagement, and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud.	88.03966879424539
For some time now, these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpayer' s money, which, when all is said and done, is what sustains the Union' s budget.	90.12102318517944
Particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud, to detecting it, punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening.	85.9010087218233
Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps, as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring.	109.23436924061039
The Union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed.	83.27439134979062
So far, efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success.	99.91845282511464
It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures.	35.49136565374508
Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States.	81.14563308082039
Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States, together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement.	50.18068050659954
What is more, the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this.	54.72871233699092
For it to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States.	35.25605646471074
After five years only four have done so.	193.80534638341013
This state of deadlock, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office.	40.588141885002216
There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority, rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests, that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity.	64.84748176423052
We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised.	61.78626363135485
The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as articulated in its position, together with those of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will also be taken full account of in this process.	21.689168371899292
We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency, transparency, and the protection of the rights of individuals.	63.78551718386298
In addition, we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and in which main principles are firmly established.	57.28702999337352
I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment.	58.55521357543706
The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings.	32.95042558972589
The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission, for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF.	99.52539578436163
The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency.	69.498313788078
The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and to OLAF' s relationship with the national authorities.	55.82642448945346
There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States.	18.900082883934502
The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts.	42.88824807667468
In addition, we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union, where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts, the so-called corpus juris, and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared.	41.12768437072987
Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men.	48.14168187155156
The Commission, Mr Barnier, Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally receptive to the idea.	68.3496576731671
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of this report, which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority.	22.8770200072225
We can set another example here, to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular, fraud, and to mete out punishment where necessary.	58.34058594222086
Mr President, I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato.	13.977025308850605
I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well, and the result, which we have received today, is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area.	39.39467734519551
This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280(4).	31.898499936675442
If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand, least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought. The Treaty is a collection of complex articles.	157.73462614874427
However, this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize.	61.07764360201392
At the same time, it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community' s financial interests, as Mrs Theato has explained very well.	24.62106931063172
We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community. But be careful.	29.04048722568471
As the French say, "ne jettons pas le bébé avec l'eau du bain" [let us not throw the baby out with the bath water], that is to say, in the protection of the Community' s financial interests, we must respect, on the one hand - as Mrs Theato has said - the competences of the Member States, but also other matters which affect the citizens, which affect the essential guarantees.	31.167447738795104
The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly.	148.47077617570304
Therefore, in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and, of course, as an MEP, I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission.	21.20366292809938
Mr President, this, as Mrs Theato said, is a critical report.	33.86797098216052
It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report.	23.06880745877115
One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because, whether we like it or not, the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement. It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is.	78.43642899898066
We need to do something about it.	12.656266351591391
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget.	19.92843179897891
A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done.	62.01457287761221
We need to take this responsibility seriously.	25.9378850022803
We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union.	23.061499073772254
The question is: who prosecutes?	50.050024486162066
That is where we really get into difficulty.	77.45485152898809
Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers?	100.97258966733655
We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States.	30.255932696479274
The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one.	18.28047812211834
We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people.	96.6370252755238
But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions.	67.4890312096415
Of most importance to Parliament, as the guardian of the budget of the European Union, is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions.	44.59544574940511
At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal.	43.19003257556566
People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted, and that is not the case at the moment.	35.15410014793037
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio.	48.149694092443006
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question.	30.239036006589192
We are aware that it is a delicate debate.	20.244594917532922
We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties.	49.5660324240185
Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here, no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor.	40.28823397510831
But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable.	24.169240396269263
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report.	6.508855928221917
I think it is a first-class report which will, for the most part, be supported by my group.	26.736962779584793
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage.	32.40308398470318
Judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months, this could well be the case.	44.32199336463147
We all know that, in 1995, it was agreed that the Union' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law.	25.4415988373588
But the Member States failed to cooperate.	26.113093801804503
This is just a political fact about which little can be done at present, I think.	70.16500790147889
It is now possible, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, that the Commission will take new initiatives, and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity.	27.12621575541642
Unlike the previous speaker, who has now disappeared, my group is strongly in favour of a European Public Prosecutor.	33.67660102573419
My colleague Jan-Kees Wiebenga, will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter.	39.064599933192795
I think what we need is, at European level, to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible.	35.680081443982495
I myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic.	30.33428685670674
One of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong, especially when it comes to revenue of the European Union, then this will be termed an irregularity in one country and a crime in another.	54.50346691385024
This, I thought, is no longer permissible, certainly not at the moment.	33.3222899061579
I would like to make one general point on politics. Whatever we may say about the European elections, the low turnout is a fact.	57.61409279090639
We can improve on this by punishing crime in Europe quickly, and this must be done at European level.	45.78184369245272
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur.	6.304752450082747
Mrs Theato' s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions.	39.70529129614648
I believe that is something we are all desperately in need of, bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turnout.	44.03184239823695
Yet, every year we have the same problem.	44.523862267583375
The Court of Auditors publishes its report, which criticises the Member States on account of various incidences of fraud.	33.90761698447926
So far, however, the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here, to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied.	54.629139792447525
It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year.	53.72420216921843
I believe that Mrs Theato' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here.	62.29951969904631
It is important that after the first step, which has already been taken, i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF, in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework.	95.76317383546665
We will need the European Public Prosecutor' s Office for this, which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees, also for suspects.	51.87830563554515
Having said all that, I must say that unfortunately, my group will not be voting for your report as a united front.	43.49048759634492
I hope that the debate will convince a few more people.	35.90936705802824
Unfortunately, however, people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity.	61.25590968583939
But I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato' s report receives more support.	40.57973347165967
Mr President, we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled, even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Treaties, so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests can be guaranteed.	28.343880024542795
The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea, but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system.	49.484865712998804
Indeed, we are talking about criminal law, the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation is, and will be, fierce.	93.71394118486242
Indeed, it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a European legal system.	102.8890043728996
Reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are.	101.21660660426119
In any case, this idea must be encouraged, and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties.	50.53693515915432
On behalf of my group, but also personally, I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens' rights and guarantees, which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States.	57.86656756818975
Therefore, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that we support the Theato report; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda.	25.585312624266678
Mr President, Mrs Theato' s report on the protection of the European Union' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Prosecutor.	33.03117400033575
This proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state.	51.93198903786296
But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters.	38.148407820468414
Moreover, this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms.	176.77835514731126
According to the Theato report, the European Public Prosecutor is needed, in particular, in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office, OLAF.	42.07286556152926
At the same time, however, we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a European Union court.	28.788199477777457
In this way, a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one, and a medium-sized one may hide a large one.	95.64675722047744
Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one, as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then, why not a European Minister of Justice, supervised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament?	75.99014034352605
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform, which appears to be quite specific.	46.61941912585371
In the final analysis, we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a Europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form, organised around a superstate.	51.426107390254444
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on the other hand, wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network.	57.484924555315764
And such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities, for example, and the creation, if necessary, of national teams specialising in offences involving Community finances.	131.20080491783514
So the legal framework, Mr President, is already in place.	62.560772179180155
It is fine, in principle.	56.18591032122987
It need only be fine-tuned.	154.46360110375056
Mr President, Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason.	85.91391234064372
Public opinion, although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows, is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution: a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General.	123.71980728018629
Mrs Theato probably forgot to include a European prison now that we have the FBI, the European police, in the form of OLAF.	60.61698638409523
All this would be established by two regulations, one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code. The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty, i.e. based on secondary law, whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible.	102.53299512336046
And indeed there is a twofold shift.	77.51149105549918
Firstly, the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift, a single market, a single VAT, a single diplomatic service, a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor.	76.77480905757115
All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion, while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the Generalised System of Preferences, free trade areas, customs presents to Chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource, GDP, as a result of the budgetary rationing pact.	104.31693925475365
Next we have the Puritan shift: the Teutonic Europe of the North, the Europe of the Lutherans, Calvinists and Quakers, wishes to inflict its moral order on us.	59.64506014860404
Basically, the more we lose our grip on morals, the more we tighten our grip on our wallet.	63.68604553371818
Mr President, it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union, more so these days than there used to be.	40.1100444179873
The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe' s citizens.	54.24377893130018
The credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future.	98.0299249803979
This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law.	61.049719984737074
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this.	96.42257627190554
Now it is, of course, possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the Member States and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity.	28.873324422609922
There is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level.	34.0640422895799
When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda, it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage.	62.24120300061312
Now that is not a contradiction, since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law, as detailed in Recommendations I and II of the report, is actually about taking action in the EU' s own interests, which, as far as that goes, does not damage the legal interests of the Member States; on the contrary, it protects them, at least indirectly.	58.28505792298338
The compatibility with the various national systems of law, as confirmed by experts, shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common, for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned.	72.02792081970298
Taking these aspects into account, I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind, as proposed, and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF.	60.22113766038258
Mr President, will a European Public Prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving EU funds?	78.5418220960628
I do not believe so.	18.68984677077828
On the other hand, we can go a long way using the existing tools.	36.94588939309266
An alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be Eurojust, as proposed at the last Summit.	44.04866342129673
In the way it is structured, Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes.	135.82624740218887
It is just such practical cooperation there is a need for.	65.79064540536218
OLAF, Europol and the Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters should be used fully and, when the Fraud Convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the Member States, we can also achieve a lot with this.	75.64412607158395
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement.	36.72545410711853
It is simply too bad, and I can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common European Public Prosecutor' s Office instead.	45.390933640629264
However, it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office.	54.79260819216232
It is, after all, only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law. Ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence.	67.89214230486625
Instead, there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily.	43.28529488580994
We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and, especially, change our practice.	200.38834442415234
At the moment, Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used.	46.965527340946345
Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions!	93.82022071422205
Mr President, we all want to do something about combating European fraud.	38.803601681071825
But the question is now: is the European Union doing anything about it as well?	44.050196742866014
The answer to this is that we know very little about this.	33.890838325808986
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime.	72.24920521492244
Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but, in reality, we have made little progress.	67.95740624836571
There is no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States, as was stated before, have not ratified the treaty texts submitted.	118.14690257276801
So a great deal has to be done in this area.	20.99534601021983
And what exactly should be done?	79.47265029136108
Two things, and Mrs Theato' s report clearly spells these out.	118.88660133119832
Firstly, the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union.	62.94465089936405
So, unification in this small area.	59.909948644697074
Secondly, we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor' s Office with two tasks, firstly to assist the national public prosecutors, helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and, secondly, to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision.	123.9269912165877
The European Public Prosecutor' s Office is nothing to be afraid of.	31.08786056979168
I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on.	21.582194759528416
It is, in fact, something very positive.	30.326093815515197
Just like Europol. Europol, involving police cooperation, does not rank above the national police forces, but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces.	122.01004464273002
This is exactly the task which a small, limited, European Public Prosecutor' s Office should carry out, not just at the criminal investigation stage, but also at the prosecution stage.	61.123968463988064
Parliament supports this.	104.22252158520098
The Committee of Wise Men supports this.	43.21510349261029
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same.	15.945371760082049
Mr President, I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris.	11.288176880056596
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue.	18.29330068804031
Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation.	79.33324143041128
The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK.	75.7086827080334
The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about.	33.44341920581538
Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget.	89.94136028407712
But when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurists, with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity.	50.055871927023134
We need a public debate on this.	21.06754666577667
We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed.	17.203601665623545
The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed.	38.19561426903646
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date.	42.2807775766912
It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate.	34.50030552181064
Mr President, on behalf of the Italian Radical Members, I abstained on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control, because I share the concerns that have been voiced, in such an authoritative way, by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important: common law.	40.26163562521722
With this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue, since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be curbed, to be crushed.	46.65087388556188
Nevertheless, the way in which our committee intends to see this text through, with the drive and stubborn desire of its Chair, Mrs Theato, will not be without its critics.	85.0826439545286
Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law.	182.37033524783234
Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud.	48.422384955665144
Nevertheless, we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality, without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this. That is to say, they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system.	94.0074077247369
We wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee.	53.92665505787635
Mr President, we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament, during the plenary sittings and in the committees, even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture, the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed.	44.28420009297477
We find ourselves dealing with some very serious events, which in the past seemed to be the norm.	33.329043545526915
Today, something has changed, at least in terms of mechanisms, and especially as regards monitoring, but we are still not satisfied, particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a European Public Prosecutor, crimes, fraud, the misappropriation of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one' s office at European level.	80.94826704849021
I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community' s interests, its image and its relationship with taxpayers, who are an indispensable and essential part of Community life.	64.45187537222466
For this reason, it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests, and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual States.	34.56852949661468
In this respect, we are faced with the most sensitive issue: what role would a European Public Prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems?	48.51906510836194
This issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms.	47.63001660206265
Today, we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country.	91.9158557018882
Mr President, I would very much just like to add to two particular points.	18.75500441565761
Firstly, I would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States, although I am very much in favour of having such a debate, for my regular viewing of British television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home-grown legal system.	66.5354145762729
Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion, but I digress.	80.05182338216709
The point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato' s report.	26.433999741793006
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the European Union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences litigable as European criminal offences - we have become embroiled in legalities.	45.67397556270819
I am referring to Recommendations 1 and 2.	57.458205092590106
After all, there is no longer mention of a European Public Prosecutor, rather, for legal reasons it has now become an independent, European authority, or "body" to quote Mrs Theato.	110.71826388233214
We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis.	74.21103798514815
We also face difficulties with regard to offences.	65.95561461025684
Nothing has changed there.	121.55825117040776
As has always been the case, there are offences that transcend European offences, as it were, or at least there is the potential for them to do so, and these might include money-laundering, receiving stolen goods, and forming a criminal organisation.	105.15380817013647
As far as that is concerned, I believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome.	35.434150813592204
What Parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affairs.	49.23946201291565
Mr President, for years, Parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.	40.36845211262961
Frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention (and of the protocols relating to this protection) which, five years after being signed, has still not been ratified and has still not come into force.	94.40810921832184
On the other hand, more pro-active attempts, such as OLAF, which is currently operating, have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights.	92.2470963110094
The proposals in Mrs Theato' s report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection, under criminal law, of our financial interests, which would criminalise certain activity, specifically fraud against the Community budget. These proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently-needed uniform criminal law for the whole Community.	75.36445313845323
At the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigations by OLAF, without harming the administration of justice by each Member State and under the supervision of the European Court of Justice.	34.83433813001832
Finally, following on from what was agreed in Tampere, the report restates the need for a European Public Prosecutor. This issue has been brought once again to the fore by Commissioner Vitorino' s timely decision to ask the IGC to include in its agenda the creation of this new role, which everyone considers vital.	72.24710372803811
We should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions, by protecting the Union' s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community' s economic life.	51.05292085957336
Nevertheless, it raises some very basic questions.	170.82738636720794
Is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying, in legal terms, the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which, although it might be called subsidiary, will always clash with the practice, and in certain areas, with the traditional, separate criminal law of the Member States?	73.94787567122279
As there are doubts, would it not be more advisable, from a political point of view, to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda, and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor?	49.09898711715252
Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom, security and justice?	31.109154903900627
Mr President, the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny.	37.55476888844547
Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged.	31.871999241049092
To remedy this, vigorous efforts are required.	93.94525430602089
We therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently.	54.13060648705549
At the same time, we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way.	26.177804363646448
It is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States.	23.788835986384484
We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework.	80.85591342653238
On the other hand, I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime.	48.267195037726744
In the present situation, I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor, which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty.	26.58942986792727
We have more confidence in Eurojust, where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate.	84.38848879122462
The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but, rather, that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered.	74.58480911561963
The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is, however, to find the right mix.	60.843324936190925
The mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which, through an exaggerated supervision of detail, prevents the development of a modern administration.	93.90969254749791
We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten' s report.	21.764133797044995
The main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision.	98.65821007141322
Our experience of modern administration tells us that openness, decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision.	266.80900613784587
The major challenge is, therefore, to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law.	52.257475725443506
This requires staff training, more modern recruitment methods and, above all, openness and public control.	165.5118253450918
Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities.	215.92998759397375
Mr President, rapporteur, restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the European institutions and in European politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us.	27.50547119106204
The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this.	92.19309627905439
Parliament is committed to this task, which is something this report bears impressive witness to.	91.05712047650098
On behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do, in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change, to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the European Union.	51.21269612689925
On ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty, all Member States stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the European Union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment.	78.48689972383697
Yet as things stand, only the first four Member States have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995.	113.91973674788906
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation	27.75209489036929
A legislative act, a directive, in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility, and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective, may enable us to take a major step forwards, and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste.	58.56420492482017
OLAF, the European anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud.	53.414585691118276
Accordingly, the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks, the ECB and the EIB, contested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations, citing their independent status.	67.61542875885182
This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting, and I hope that Parliament approves this step.	60.915579564784565
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions.	42.97468819306028
It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF, which was set up at the same time as OLAF, to safeguard the independence of OLAF, however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF.	79.08030444368715
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point.	22.8790763732279
In other words, there is a loophole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on.	37.988693288213135
There is one thing I would ask though: I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority.	57.40343479878886
No, there must be no undermining of OLAF' s authority, and neither do I think this was the rapporteur' s intention.	61.29544234096904
As such, I would ask you to give OLAF' s work your full support, also in its present form.	94.9180418212768
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.	11.40811540516848
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	3.2691741867479744
VOTE	281.09893356486054
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)	35.43811322211077
Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE).	152.44457834626917
Mr President, on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure: namely Rules 133(2) and 138(4). These are both about voting.	61.43821149336328
Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes, the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then, if there is some doubt, should we utilise the electronic voting system?	124.1782726689135
That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call.	107.99135545023381
You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it.	161.10372563439216
In this particular case, I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on.	28.72310291074577
Mr President, I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general.	63.16073407186776
It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands, so to speak, but go straight to the electronic voting system.	86.22944422463102

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Own resources	433.59240372071594
. (FR) The European Union is apparently financed through four own resources.	114.85330226922775
The European budget is effectively sourced from VAT and on the basis of GDP, especially now that the Community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy, which had already been cut back drastically by the Generalised System of Preferences.	47.841191731666214
Since then, Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP, the taxable basis for the fourth resource, have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources.	75.58780581757034
Since then, of course, this Europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is, but which it refuses to see itself as.	134.3517279990363
This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us.	50.13395889702971
It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources, the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission.	125.52731018668426
Furthermore, the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States.	36.00207872786365
This is a long way from offshoots such as the "Community criminal code" , the "European Public Prosecutor" or a European police force, with OLAF.	41.62730939676231
There is as yet no federal European tax.	200.34601908903684
All the same, a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income, if not on profits, or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 2025.	138.18253323383013
Koch Report (A5-0105/1999)	14.37657378543322
- (FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods.	29.613160668605662
In recent years, the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably, increasing the risk of accidents.	54.781139573031886
Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation.	64.55983869836398
It therefore proved necessary, in the context of establishing the internal market, to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention.	57.758118733169
Directive 96/35/EC was a response to this requirement.	81.0644179188685
Firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged, quite rightly, to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention, whether road, rail or inland waterway transport is involved.	101.01361965657361
In order to facilitate achieving this objective, Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training.	90.92821271624146
This professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation, regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport.	126.89203187728957
While this represented significant progress at the time, the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem.	106.04051312637577
It therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised, high-level training of safety advisers, but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training, with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different Member Sates.	58.82249810859866
The Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised.	31.68910433361315
It outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies.	83.4915210888874
Parliament voted in favour of this text.	25.4437886672898
It did, however, table a number of amendments, most of which were adopted in the Council' s common position, particularly regarding the need to draw up a questionnaire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the 'specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body' .	51.86689053357857
In order to be realistic, I further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force.	65.34468176142461
I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users, to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods.	52.22500480559898
Koch Report (A5-0104/1999)	14.37657378543322
Last October I expressed my views on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail.	30.365712818563118
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then.	180.9026328064228
Essentially, my opinion is as follows: I deplore the fact that, in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods, we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment.	54.92790458566765
I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997.	21.40152663110013
This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999.	99.80093454528968
This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations.	32.57116945591571
In line with the usual procedure, it is the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) which puts forward standards in this area, and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 (known generally as ADR), applicable throughout Europe, whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU.	85.5774558848295
The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted.	45.346757931965286
Consequently, the Commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problems, rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements, as should have been the case!	35.08120743816181
This is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail, except for the fact that a time limit had been decided.	49.45081628517338
Right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the CEN will be in a position to put forward practical proposals.	42.33038266473348
Until then, there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations.	97.79638855672752
The report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted, and grants States the option of adopting or applying alternative standards.	200.2456396638599
They may, therefore, continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation, where there are no applicable European standards.	114.777092843716
They may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation.	84.99704257991247
In offering this explanation of my vote, therefore, I wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern.	60.54811737120397
Schroedter Report (A5-0108/1999)	15.870412244561583
Mr President, I wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the Schroedter report with regard to regional development.	81.6872031936015
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in Europe.	36.2949329200351
Not only the difference in income per capita but, above all, large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern.	94.51869138941024
Despite the fact that the Community, through the structural funds among others, injects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in Europe, these disparities continue to exist.	98.67477091419998
I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more drastic change of tack and, based on very strict evaluations, change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively.	57.98520064069394
Mr President, in relation to the Schroedter report, I am aware, and have had it confirmed to me by Mr Barnier, that the rules on additionality concerning Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self-governing regions such as Wales or Scotland.	49.33547980214057
I regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.	59.341403489051736
I hope we can revisit this issue at a later time.	19.727026954090817
I want it to be clear that though I voted in favour of the report, I have this important reservation.	37.33435897785015
- The Schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of EU Structural Funds in Europe for the period 2000-2006.	31.879378604539625
I believe that this is particularly important as EU Structural Funds are always spent in a manner which maximises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision-making process for the spending of such funds.	37.083338168188476
As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster, I have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom-up schemes supported by national EU funds.	39.588363458017966
I believe that the Irish Government and the European Commission and different EU governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities.	85.49041908118403
I believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision-making process for the spending of European Structural Funds.	30.801493851030784
For example, we have seen the success of the Leader I and Leader II schemes in Ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of Ireland and within Europe.	37.58758977894945
The Leader III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year.	99.37942903019311
The Leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public, private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long-term and sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas.	52.51482819447598
This is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit.	63.435337260041166
The European Peace and Reconciliation Fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in Ireland.	70.43512529865498
Once again, there is active participation from groups from the private, public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region.	125.63599600733247
During the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006, other EU initiatives such as "Equal" and "Urban" will be operating.	102.36040672311144
These initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spent.	56.31428100728736
The rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new EU Structural Fund plans and programmes.	49.66453418459068
They must promote a decentralised, efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities.	68.19248614263766
This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national, European and local funding.	100.44794615619594
.	785.4324778346265
(FR) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy.	58.36782706118967
In order to reduce disparities between regions, of course.	34.33003942110058
But more especially because, even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy, it may also be a source of inequality.	91.36417813180063
Jacques Delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities.	82.48541568255706
It is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the European social model, which we are all in favour of, and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion.	26.590089175166348
This is a real political objective, alongside economic and monetary affairs, drawn up in collaboration with Member States, regions and local communities, with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming.	54.77066577956995
This is why I shall support this report, despite regretting the fact that, for timetabling reasons, the European Parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist Member States, regions and local communities in the programming of Objectives 1, 2 and 3.	43.562611469587765
Moreover, I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion, support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy.	26.750582368671264
Mrs Schroedter' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid.	32.103637616207656
It highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved, chiefly those involved at a local level, who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems, hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships, which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned.	86.11131268278068
This is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid.	32.07770833573616
In order to do so, the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament, associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society.	56.78996113635716
These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid.	66.08147199025431
Amended again as such by the Schroedter report, they are a step in the right direction.	62.01457287761221
They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006, but that is another subject.	50.89215160612411
In the meantime, let us support this first step.	30.780292694353
- This report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some Member States.	40.757900891213865
Although I wholeheartedly support this aim, I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether.	267.1419055779488
In my mind, illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping.	160.01808902255044
We all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry, we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments.	137.86287306158752
If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans, then we must have a level playing field.	70.59595087184313
Illegal state aid, by contrast, destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment.	375.90342286588356
There are, of course, cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate, for example helping companies restructure.	95.26886867061202
In all such cases, however, strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained.	101.04705311910436
Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry, EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law.	58.746451042252836
I enthusiastically support the report's proposal to publish a "scoreboard" showing the amount of state aid per Member State.	57.39445745509071
Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed.	97.41167924632899
Member States cannot be allowed to proclaim European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private.	67.67064882682119
I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling.	47.47272539958364
Much remains to be done, however, and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe.	42.44834462771573
.	785.4324778346265
(PT) The Commission' s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. It is therefore crucial that the European Parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity, given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective Member States.	54.77319915695436
Unfortunately, the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight.	57.28601928865986
It is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions, of which the Portuguese regions of the Azores and Madeira are examples. This must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion.	33.50876226817949
The truth is though, that the Commission' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives.	53.786066069344706
On the other hand, it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs - with rights - effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity, and supporting the social economy and solidarity. There must also be support for rural development, for small and medium-sized enterprises, for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas, specifically in the field of social housing, with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.	69.76466698268182
.	785.4324778346265
(IT) While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities, we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled, or rather in some cases, as with Italy' s Objective 1 zones, paradoxically, disparities are being exacerbated, particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures; despite the changes to the rules, the Community structures have not yet been streamlined.	72.94385369119492
In the first place, if administrative procedures are not simplified, it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform, with a view to greater efficiency and concentration.	90.06805298451746
In this respect, the Commission document has shortcomings, as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities, and for their funding, execution and monitoring.	62.339577238243926
SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still "weak operators" , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds.	117.56648614173393
A considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time.	81.68521669157072
In view of this, in accordance with the decision on the 97/99 guidelines (Howitts report), the Commission should have consulted Parliament in time. In fact, it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States, and it published the guidelines back in July 1999, even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative duties, thereby preventing Parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines.	85.19424557002374
This is why the mid-term review, provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99, will be of considerable importance.	67.07660620358934
In general, the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent.	117.7920637538641
They merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies, and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities, or candidate countries.	73.74772297156773
That said, the differing approach adopted in the guidelines, which are not geared to geographical objectives, but rather to policy areas, can be considered as positive.	175.45067014503243
While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions, we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows, in practice, a policy of integrated interventions, for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary.	107.4892725382096
We could then, theoretically, also support the Commission' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there,provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level, but guarantees real help for those zones - and I stress this once again - which, owing to a whole string of converging negative factors, have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels, with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could, in fact, amount to a negative intervention.	112.35596139007129
The guidelines, as adopted by the Commission, are very limited because, instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance, they are providing a shopping list of possible measures, a shopping list which, as it fails to set priorities in ascending order, could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration.	90.36384666818678
We could say that, in this state of affairs, we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and, hence the destruction of the countryside.	94.38411804920487
There has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument, which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and, moreover, would accord proper status to local bodies which, being independent, could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly, and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency, concentration and administrative reform.	87.77278374597674
Rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in, by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration.	43.90365968212542
It is now a fact that in order to attain this goal, rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs, which are no longer solely connected with agriculture, in the traditional sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also, for instance, in rural tourism, sport and cultural activities, environmental projects, SMEs, services, and so on.	76.87371723487219
A genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy. The fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need "guidelines".	57.52542478585587
I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities.	22.089661666067215
In conclusion, the document is not particularly satisfactory, and in some aspects is disappointing.	58.69179610024773
Berend Report (A5-0107/1999)	26.644481196330922
. (PT) We basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union.	22.825464084772737
We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues.	51.60118442701322
Firstly, and as the Commission itself states, it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German Länder in calculating the Community average from 1991 onwards.	78.74676232629683
This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union' s per capita GDP level.	89.26083763062691
We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment. This consequently imposes the need for new development strategies, with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area.	85.50150788258443
This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States, which is what the report proposes.	48.15624949397123
Finally, but no less importantly, I would like to refer to the rapporteur' s proposal that, in future, this type of report should also include, amongst other issues, an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State.	68.70134336080518
The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue. This kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional (and other) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State.	90.78364228639124
. (FR) Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union' s declared ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment, the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration.	115.58957567694117
As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power. A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today.	104.91105420316596
The management of ABB Alsthom Power, following a merger carried out in June 1999, announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries.	51.2614618825399
This damaging situation for employment raises many questions, particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council, in existence since 1996.	175.2960483912057
It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened.	58.63140449112617
It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment, the environment and consumers into consideration.	172.38275615644332
Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect, I abstained.	23.59822918608455
.	785.4324778346265
(PT) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy, the Commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion. Issues of mergers and state aid however, still remain within the notification system.	147.19101526641248
The position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy, moving towards applying Community law in national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice, and even aims at having specialised courts.	109.23806748065348
This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States.	68.44283549063698
On the other hand, as the rapporteur points out, in the name of competition policy, public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies, with the privatisation of important industries and public companies, as has happened in Portugal, with harmful consequences for the country and its workers.	69.96595230147189
- (FR) The Commission' s White Paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (now 81 and 82) certainly does not propose any "renationalisation" of competition policy, as some Members of the European Parliament fear.	45.572543544404894
But it does, at least, make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union.	43.37907112893586
In fact, taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade, and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States, the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements, and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion.	80.94050899281294
The most remarkable thing, in my view, is the message conveyed by this proposal: that the Commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily, and virtually automatically, requires reform of the centralised system.	73.1273522595609
Admittedly, this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling.	134.6123361033709
Indeed, the White Paper envisages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system.	46.64422314351637
Moreover, the von Wogau report, which the European Parliament has just voted on, supports it in so doing.	51.379965665779345
But at the same time, one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended.	76.10650721793279
It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term.	25.30990767205294
Is this not, indeed, what is so distressing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament?	42.97646078140515
The German Social Democrats voted against the von Wogau report because, in their view, it might break up European policy on competition, which is to say, in plain terms, attacking the standardising superstate.	49.03387411801397
Curiously, a number of employers agreed with them, preferring the European "one-stop" system, which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally.	97.31237439988946
Indeed, this is one advantage of the present system.	42.225662989052495
But, on the other hand, the wider view must also be taken, namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may, in the long term, lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account, and this will be of benefit to everyone.	55.240576743077646
Rapkay Report (A5-0078/1999)	16.286807820446725
The Members of Parliament from the Lutte Ouvrière Party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on European competition policy.	31.806966102483585
Competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other, which constantly takes the form of layoffs, factory closures, not to mention extensive waste of production capacity.	145.6388091057205
We see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in Europe proposed by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power.	44.2530116705405
Eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union, despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world: these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote.	47.13617227816248
The Commission' s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market is ridiculous, for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest elements.	57.786686037805495
This is repulsive most of all in social terms.	47.582402496739846
The European Commission' s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes.	56.34038792186459
There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still!	107.00105432272034
We acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions, and still less of improving them.	83.39391968957155
- (FR) In voting against this report, we are acting as spokespersons for all the men and women who in Seattle and throughout Europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic.	86.19285749981765
We are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services, in memory of the victims of the Paddington rail disaster, killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations.	59.87639148098989
This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle, for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century.	77.20970737002331
Whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere, culture or cooperation with the third world, excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity.	70.02896880986198
Do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy?	67.69524141887756
We are convinced that the opposite is true, and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive.	35.44079168948537
Excessive in comparison with what iron rule, what criteria of efficiency?	545.9432485222186
Finally, after Seattle, do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO?	110.21695618481947
Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness.	195.5706747156457
Jonckheer Report (A5-0087/1999)	15.44793589211361
I am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU, and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report, and also that the Directorate-General for Competition will be making information, both general and specific, publicly accessible via its website.	49.493750488375056
I am happy with the rapporteur' s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this.	28.920938527462802
There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition.	101.46643847442569
Admittedly, an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union.	23.98581985211748
However, as the rapporteur pointed out, such aid is occasionally essential and may, in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm, make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general economic interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158).	84.1092866952755
Clearly though, it must be monitored, a task which falls to the European Commission.	56.54091647542366
The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997, including 40% allocated to the manufacturing sector.	170.80669758136483
This aid is considerably less than the previous period, 1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector).	87.99132044026366
This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder.	52.80477436393968
Like the rapporteur, I deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid.	44.91935173046222
The European Commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible.	25.71260612575803
It must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time, which is to say in time for the ninth report.	24.86499921658065
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per Member State.	43.95540981900177
I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid.	17.721038003109523
In order to compensate for this situation, the European Commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us.	28.266144783379808
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous: the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one Member State to another, with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU.	51.63881974371525
This is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment, industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries.	43.77266696149587
Langen Report (A5-0073/1999)	22.55835073116594
In the important debate on competition this morning, I expressed my views on Mr Langen' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Steel Aid Code.	42.485148496508124
Just as the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996, the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation.	73.64472443044745
Establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable, even though Article 4(c), of the ECSC Treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry.	70.39221535798559
This, indeed, is the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code.	29.65430857841796
At the same time, it is, of course, essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.	39.387736956037024
It is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development, environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure.	44.698773810793845
In the same way, it is vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings, as stipulated under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code.	35.02426133230763
The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or, at least, annually, without the need for reminders.	68.98881679633206
Like the rapporteur, I am pleased with the Commission report, but I did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid.	31.45960187861532
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has, on a number of occasions, authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code.	41.394621980966114
In the interests of equality, there are grounds to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment.	91.79663083927427
Finally, we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty.	20.071577736915962
The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002.	81.83082660928203
My feeling in this respect is that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code.	66.27747132555344
For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report, and I now await the Commission' s response to our requests and demands.	29.778287370602783
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	7.3163623546009156
Oil slick off the French coast	82.10591055008416
The next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast.	14.196840335355779
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission.	21.37321617275346
Mr President, I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but also as an elected representative for Brittany, and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events.	26.338289377647325
Together with Mrs Grossetête and the PPE-DE Group, we tabled a motion for a resolution.	24.820831323559105
I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion.	18.71094449348631
The Erika shipwreck is a truly European issue, firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, with extremely serious consequences for tourism, people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists, and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale.	74.37243449679428
A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline, and why?	197.6945448848513
Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act, which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities, as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable, and is more restrictive, and, more especially, more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and, in particular, the existence of the American coastguard.	71.26705740395951
If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred.	77.41150390884994
This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed, particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners, in this case the oil tanker charterer, from any liability.	64.30529200377859
Well, if the charterer is exonerated, then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for.	78.75329618988088
The regulations must therefore be reviewed, and I thank you, Commissioner, for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations.	48.743164392196434
Moreover, as you said, monitoring must above all be stepped up: that of the flag state, that of the classification societies.	133.6803557801944
You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission.	119.5780056641789
What are the conditions for this recognition?	39.309280204157915
What guarantees are there of its reliability?	72.02915727152221
You are going to commission a fact-finding mission.	54.12839965011104
We await the outcome with great interest.	108.96208576933054
Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up.	80.7528827777042
There is a Paris Memorandum in existence, let me remind you, which stipulates a minimum for inspection, that is, one in four of the vessels putting into European ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned.	67.48803359740144
This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries.	59.04236142594023
Why not?	462.81688807855926
What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw?	175.1999489223045
I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for, in this case, the oil company.	42.99536952339842
If the charterer' s liability entails a financial commitment, then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent.	90.0874674797316
Finally, we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the United States.	41.03842290553238
Firstly, I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team.	57.400642913430914
This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area.	80.20266713161759
Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster.	108.89326426063984
I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes.	69.26005333345637
Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation, and last but not least, the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year.	94.5248661844128
How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union, not just certain areas of it?	72.15057018699318
How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds?	151.67628453453523
How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which, as our resolution points out, causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster?	284.9361362625374
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards, we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters: rust buckets badly crewed'.	95.17510656441151
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively.	26.905019305622645
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety.	50.049165327924314
The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods. Just as the Sea Empress, just as the Braer did.	93.05433544828395
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster.	54.99974287845843
My group's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster, just as my group's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions.	77.33992641865699
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again, later on this year, discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea.	155.8268776210215
The time for resolutions has passed.	82.14487518611001
What is now needed is action.	86.2608636433841
Sadly, I fear, the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster.	100.33286698646
Mr President, every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again.	52.90914476648658
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea, but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future.	74.58598276353163
The "Erika" incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected, but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe.	63.596614262953175
Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe.	64.43113390224318
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds, perhaps mainly guillemots, may have died.	137.51313036732225
The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic.	101.41458518657892
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying.	140.72107334680652
We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the "polluter pays" principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced.	58.20465419854238
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks, but the question is, how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes?	55.80643636326984
As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year, were a similar incident, just as devastating, to take place, if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice.	103.91445773858985
The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully.	77.60117176663299
Mr President, Commissioner, I have brought you a small gift. Here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of Noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows: "With every tide, the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the Erika.	73.06548448132546
With every tide, the volunteers, members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick, sticky, black tar.	53.21755701473098
When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident?"	58.41429707263662
Indeed this disaster involving the Erika, like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey, moreover, is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available.	119.77014363166306
It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster, despite our saying at the time and many times since, "Never again!"	114.41240553892155
It is, of course, the responsibility of policies, and therefore our responsibility, to guarantee the safety of sea transport.	45.89121386742879
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again.	75.24161434503009
But, listening to you, Commissioner, we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992, I believe, the Commission and Parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee.	63.29329913637687
Indeed, we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many.	123.38205539179879
This is why it is essential, as a matter of urgency, for the European Union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes.	38.34566535390232
We should be aware, for example, that Shell and British Petroleum refused to use the Erika to transport their oil.	81.50519118294474
Why, in these circumstances, is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised?	122.6840405229973
Your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance, at last, of the ban on degassing at sea.	71.53572066542961
A European inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently.	105.68206495701533
In addition, it is also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO, as a matter of urgency.	16.14037905777898
What point is there in issuing restrictive directives if, once they are at sea, most vessels do just what they wish?	343.518356901189
Finally, a compassionate thought for all the volunteers, nature lovers and bird lovers, who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds, organising rescue operation with the means available.	78.7328327375936
I can testify to this remarkable work.	56.43102330389439
You are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick, which is a major ecological disaster, practically unprecedented in scale.	47.878299171759274
In relation to this, you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces.	70.60456906762951
And, on this subject, Commissioner, you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats.	30.36048616885429
Once again, there will be no clearly defined party responsible.	136.37456759432717
In the meantime, it is nature that is taking the rap, as always.	61.071061912317724
Mr President, my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster, affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment to their natural environment.	47.809481522704814
Let me, in this connection, welcome the presence in the visitors' gallery of Mrs Javette-Le Besque, spokesperson for the oil slick action group "Marée noire" , made up of men and women from the French department of Morbihan.	59.12815138019206
Many volunteers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field.	104.89209625595765
As the European Parliament, we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and, at the same time, demanding tightening up of the quality criteria, on the European and international scale, of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport, stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders.	57.36520872145423
Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers.	45.883829072019296
Among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year, 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more.	138.42443131449258
This is no longer tolerable.	13.934558755099454
Next, we have flags of convenience.	59.744886113523926
According to the International Transport Federation, over 40% of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience, the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety.	52.988587542261165
This is no longer tolerable.	13.934558755099454
Finally, there is the lack of transparency.	32.88156914641839
Everything is done to make the lines of responsibility, the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible.	62.569483525474254
This is no longer tolerable.	13.934558755099454
In all these respects we must ensure real, significant change, including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards, including the mandatory double hull, on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States.	89.03664300446782
We must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels.	92.99099413578467
Finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused.	35.7979160515732
I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance.	65.51043819693521
This is an approach, Mr President, which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation.	33.52281006996559
In so doing, it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which, in this instance, is awaiting clear, tangible action.	90.11702677990122
Mr President, Commissioner, as a Member for the French Atlantic coast, for Vendée, I should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disasters, caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us, but by a crime.	38.34404719757417
In this emergency, in this ordeal, we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity: local solidarity, national solidarity, and intergovernmental solidarity.	124.84442084429642
What the stricken populations are waiting for now, those who have lost everything, particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism, those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come, is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused, but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future.	70.88668734261805
Quite clearly, we are now paying the price for our lack of concern.	58.96437122416183
Because our states, with the blessing of the Community, did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear, we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience, drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals.	72.7964561292947
It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility, irresponsible charterers, untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies.	26.05459910115791
So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion.	68.51098090671381
Obviously, such matters should be handled at world level, but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose, and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determinedly to make them stricter, despite previous disasters.	113.43897964246105
Admittedly, there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, IOPCF, but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level, which must be reviewed.	134.26245260221935
The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO.	15.172886899166071
It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this.	31.93558920291068
Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience, that of a state applying for membership of the European Union.	25.738974067123866
In addition, there are Community directives, but they are seldom applied, if at all, due to the insufficient number of national inspectors.	70.38030056996949
This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency.	15.860963123405103
A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years, but it is making very slow progress.	48.43227985687588
The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings.	86.84257727577814
The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. It is now scheduled for July.	80.10226406136383
This must be brought forward.	25.916496930348412
The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict.	58.96546777408305
I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities.	108.46593670832962
Firstly, the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally.	75.29250654914678
The best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil, criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select.	80.90450745409416
Secondly, the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely.	38.06068472355
Thirdly, a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future.	54.55625069143338
This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age.	94.17641986308477
If we do not obtain a framework of Community regulations which is sufficiently clear, strict and trenchant, then those Member States that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory, in the same way that the United States succeeded in learning the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters.	47.826479958806175
Thus, the Erika was refused access to American waters.	112.27728654253512
If the European Community had done the same, a great disaster would have been avoided.	54.97119026436524
Let us ensure, Mr President, Commissioner, that this time we really do learn the lesson, even after the media hype and the shock of this House have died down.	67.8051780916644
Mr President, Torrey Canyon, Olympic Bravery, Haven, Amoco Cadiz, Gino, Tanio, so many names we remember with horror.	38.59990211553442
And now the Erika.	98.65745737187616
Whose turn is next?	859.5353926032549
Twenty one years after Amoco Cadiz, this umpteenth oil slick, the seventh since 1967, shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers.	127.04229874756017
The Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react, for their capitulation to the multinationals.	59.389951296294356
It is hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept, and why Europe, normally so quick to pass environmental legislation, has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety.	90.02138082861931
And this is the result.	25.13409479245942
The Erika, a vessel flying a Maltese flag, a floating rust bucket, classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers, has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline, a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz.	72.68206574027055
As an elected representative for the Loire-Atlantique region, unfortunately, I can testify to this.	30.426957626297572
There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters, they are the result of fate.	107.46820884693531
They are the result of human thoughtlessness.	22.783360003451232
What we have here is an ecological disaster.	31.425477879143564
Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that.	81.28256783384876
It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism, fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, people who make a living from the salt marshes, shopkeepers, etc.	44.55068463175477
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series.	64.99768749090165
First of all, we must shed some light on this shipwreck.	34.989874433294084
Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission?	47.91704619499651
Next, as a matter of urgency, we muss pass legislation, firstly, regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported.	101.97831074409166
In fact, according to the experts, the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast.	82.4149233458386
We know what actually happened.	109.82417440387839
Next, reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old.	155.62935415456508
We must regulate the use of flags of convenience, make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea.	47.40324748414859
This would be a minimum requirement, I believe, on the dawn of the third millennium.	38.541323920510976
Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters, the responsibility of polluters, shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the "polluter pays" , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing, thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required, an appropriate "natural disasters" budget line must be re-established for Member States and, in the meantime, Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds.	69.5064665533341
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group.	16.811528588269564
Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning.	50.77870741544201
It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time.	85.25841467598593
We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks. The 15 clearly do not suffice.	101.79141396428403
These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things.	206.30137265323464
No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances.	105.98440187403067
This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation.	35.206808280895984
However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that.	60.29725354894608
In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system.	110.1842714860932
Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear, adequate and, at the same time, very firm response.	26.218179068230185
Many thanks for this.	96.45954956408292
This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today.	54.06639981127215
The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best.	124.19023423353912
The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money.	133.662763659819
Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members.	207.8913585979525
During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more.	121.02073043630902
What I learned is that, actually, there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision.	66.67480825269621
Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner?	27.75413288262574
First of all, the port-state control, according to which 25% of all ships require inspection.	103.89345054578446
I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place. So this 25% should be increased.	41.69895802055735
Furthermore, if a ship is no longer seaworthy, not only should the facts be examined, but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used.	69.15389088761468
But this is not in place.	16.367815457999612
Mr President, I would welcome some action in this area.	20.91924275209826
Finally, as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned, some Members have already mentioned just now that, since 1999 in the United States, ships should in any case be double-hulled.	67.47313553062982
In my opinion, we should look further into this point, and I also think that the Marpol Treaty, which comes into effect in 2001, should be looked at very closely.	35.77093037641426
Mr President, I would like to take a brief, critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to, and admiration for, the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals.	36.395130076236775
Mr President, we have already had this discussion so many times in the past.	21.362675620813505
We have achieved nothing so far, and we have been unable to reach agreement within the European Union.	22.162893531290763
That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today, and what the Commissioner has announced here, actually leads to legislation being produced; in other words, if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers: "you must push this through in the Council of Ministers" .	66.8177118634894
Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe, which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods.	41.16422647017404
So what are we to do now?	49.88722735242926
I have no intention of talking about past events; rather I want to look to the future.	61.58187110665682
What are we to do now?	45.62899132555997
I will tell you a few things we should do.	26.594013659370976
Of course, we need double-hulled vessels.	56.7979501695269
That goes without saying, but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term.	62.1942983131466
So what do we need to happen immediately?	32.43505240072161
We need technical testing of ships, that is obligatory technical testing every two years, and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate.	117.7834142559743
We need this at European level and internationally; we need something like a TÜV, an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany, which is compulsory every two years.	120.7256876116699
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle.	37.67477039660752
This is what we need for ships.	38.07289171420104
Thirdly, we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports, that is in every port of the European Union.	34.00064806827464
Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port, regardless of all the port charges.	104.20080618405085
We must reach agreement here, in all the European Union' s ports, from Marseilles, through to Rotterdam, to Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, and wherever ships drop anchor.	57.35968350720837
Fourthly, we need the shipowner to bear liability, and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million, but to the value of at least USD 400 million, to be covered per insurance certificate.	61.89519211612917
We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability.	107.78413551328944
We need to be sure that if need be, the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability.	102.99095517117752
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision!	42.86487928362904
I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability.	72.02613487121296
In the fifth place, we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union, and incidentally, that includes the candidate countries.	48.20615029124885
Last but not least, we need a long memory, for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future.	50.84611316604988
Environmental standards will be a recurring theme.	53.902784677198525
I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports.	36.864429435221986
The unions will have something to say as will industry.	116.52187830358008
A long memory will serve us well, ladies and gentlemen.	89.40596723265102
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement.	31.197163197074527
Just you go home and say: " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date" .	185.54387873004782
We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports.	20.220239634155735
We need to have a long memory when we say: " for once we are united, at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned, and will not play one off against the other in the European Union."	54.458303276062665
If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years' time!	37.061524118128816
Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts.	29.892676742291066
We have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures.	41.56379005142876
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led?	65.31452702970648
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation' s introduction of the Plimsoll line, a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels.	75.0186049545912
Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had?	100.5998954513703
I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speaks about, the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in Europe have brought up for discussion.	54.29299733185058
We must also critically examine the classification societies.	31.099914693826594
I do not think that we can accept their procedures.	16.955607291172342
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control.	131.52345486924818
Finally, I want to say that, when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment, there are units within the Commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards.	56.13842901282274
Within the Commission, the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.	40.88526189814384
It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment, which are in keeping with the Commission' s guidelines, cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards.	48.46048622056306
Mr President, we shall vote in favour of the GUE/NGL Group resolution because it denounces Total-Fina' s responsibility in this ecological disaster and I endorse the proposal that flags of convenience and the use of superannuated vessels should be prohibited, or that double hulls should be mandatory for oil tankers.	38.58784815473043
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick.	45.94849456193687
How can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations, and indeed many others who, in order to make more profit, take the risk of making the world uninhabitable?	82.92284323450762
How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality, without governments reacting?	46.8732503115099
The crux of the problem is that all governments, and indeed all the European institutions, acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Total-Fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment.	50.44361800506905
They accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks, even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions.	181.8492285014772
In these circumstances, even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations' capacity to cause damage.	95.21714052712434
Mr President, I am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies.	32.36427889012044
However, we must stick to the facts.	26.396451784019522
The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years.	33.96894257090481
The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken.	62.09055734001071
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls.	18.98829735495328
I cannot accept this.	23.669920724199745
If the Member States decide, in agreement with ourselves, that 25% of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control, then they must also make the necessary personnel available.	58.89552625822938
The controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing, rather there must be materials testing, for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue.	56.208928959266615
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous.	82.34672938259615
It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial, but include materials testing.	111.54301542001092
Secondly, I also share the Commissioner' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path.	43.0478964158385
If it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies.	96.876477295633
That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit.	68.3030023516758
Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we already have a TÜV (organisation for safety testing) for ships in the form of the classification companies.	59.08429700977528
There are reputable companies too.	73.40152343896598
You will be familiar with some reputable companies, our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some reputable companies, but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements, and these must be struck off the list.	89.64754801170996
Finally, we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements, for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up!	59.58644366752351
Mr President, Commissioner, the Erika sank near my home and is still there, with 20 000 tonnes in its hold, the fate of which we are waiting to discover.	79.34285058781221
It could have sunk anywhere.	76.94431290157218
It happened to sink there, and Brittany, where I come from, should not apologise for the fact that geography has made it a peninsula, and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after shipwrecks.	56.864912626581926
My first thoughts are for the 26 Indian sailors, who were saved but of whom nothing has been said.	71.64041530147529
There could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means, above all, men' s lives.	79.1863361460911
By now they are far away.	195.24539105224298
It is a miracle that they were saved.	13.546790739255568
So we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the Amoco Cadiz; a wreck on the North coast, a wreck on the South coast, a wreck on the West coast.	55.262285793627825
Things could well continue in the same way.	53.91594614329776
Commissioner, as time is very short, I would like to pick out the seven points which we feel, and you have already mentioned some of them, are essential to work on: double-hulled vessels in our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports. In particular, we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public, as currently, we do not have access to them.	59.138584265380004
Then, sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 Member States; they should not be different, but the same throughout the Union.	69.47565014936927
We must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience, not because they are necessarily bad boats, but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones.	63.14095004911004
We must improve information on all of the world' s ships, but provision has already been made for this. We must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them.	57.08110614266099
With regard to this matter, I would like to know who owns the Erika, because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing, but there are always real shareholders in the background. Where are the Erika' s owners?	48.85331891504126
Perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches, getting a nice tan.	48.82247432584428
We would like to know their names and their faces.	32.97909672112558
Finally, there must be improvements in the training of crews.	30.74381216484138
In our society there is no such thing as zero-risk, but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety.	78.09290354331797
Mr President, I welcome the statement from the Commissioner.	16.131969158114693
Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea's power and destructive force, which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential.	77.22156317947805
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika.	19.24057777819258
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources.	29.58466478457855
It should be noted that the oil industry, through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol, for over 90% of the estimated cost of this incident, or some USD 170 million.	142.05373024529945
This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners, to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility.	69.60563559662931
However, before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations, let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented.	60.61051213720159
Better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals.	177.65863529342568
In that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection.	63.93030604019331
I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions.	126.76533335091676
Calls for design improvements in hull construction, especially double-hulled vessels, are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet.	254.70130727708198
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection.	100.49873014141511
Mr President, I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues, mainly in the committees on transport and the environment, who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry.	25.039699882920132
Because, as well as the irreparable damage to the environment, the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry, the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry, to the conservation of marine resources, and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover.	49.274928379460796
It is no accident, Commissioner, that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed, those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which, in the majority of cases, do not have any other resources.	80.90172986594463
These are the same areas, Commissioner, which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts, without any control whatsoever.	72.85740128368545
I come from a region, Galicia, which has suffered similar accidents in the past.	52.62790981857881
Brittany and Galicia, two European 'Lands Ends' , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks.	190.37381412858483
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways.	16.514807337803443
On the one hand, by asking the Commission, within the scope of aid to the fishing industry, to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected, and also by asking them to demand, of international bodies and of themselves, tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience.	50.76987037578054
In this regard, the current process of negotiations on Malta' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag.	40.99853205440333
On the other hand, prevention is essential.	30.446086108401293
Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea.	71.2439868305843
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level, using all the means at our disposal - technological, structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future.	56.488690560743336
Lastly, Mr President, I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities, who reminded me of old times when, as the then Mayoress, I lived through similar situations.	70.22515640521704
We must thank those who, while defenceless and lacking in resources, have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions, the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks.	93.37351524253869
Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to congratulate the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, for her reaction to this incident, which has really shaken the whole of Europe.	17.1780713986049
We, as the Committee on Transport, are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and, of course, we are likewise prepared to discuss, at a later date, the legal implications of this communication.	49.36243503920488
In addition, I should like to make a number of comments:	11.061881364295889
First, the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA, the Italian shipping register, because we need to know if Community law was applied.	73.64447861506991
That should be the starting point for our efforts.	43.445799700831316
Secondly, apart from the shipowners' liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage.	63.41685822492758
Once we have done that, our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified.	46.293230764484875
However, this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine, which is an important sector of the economy, covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements, which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict, but correct.	103.03649012493379
I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but, as other members have stressed, we need to start with application, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact.	59.22846782853037
This legal framework is fairly advanced, at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States, under the supervision of the Commission, should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied.	51.207348400618294
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the unfortunate incident involving the Erika should in fact, as others have said this afternoon, constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where, since 1967, there have been seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers; more than one every two years.	49.66001114855287
The economic and social damage, which we have spoken about today, in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources, is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions.	47.8725349053696
Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented.	33.56420458306913
I trust that these measures will, in a few months, give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive, possibly - which will put an end, once and for all, to these 21st Century pirates, who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea.	53.38381399158364
I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken, which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues.	19.896908070428896
I am referring to the double hull, which consists of two layers of steel, with containers divided into two tanks.	78.39264418035009
Commissioner, there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called 'ecological hull' in which case, in the event of an accident, the seawater penetrates the containers and, as a result of pressure, the oil is transferred to other tanks.	61.30634533385705
Commissioner, I believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures.	38.08431265106843
It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries.	26.02548157022802
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard.	26.82118873845419
Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents, is bound to support this approach.	117.8761767177803
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us, after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings, finally to produce a joint resolution.	59.40516072670469
I think that given the dramatic circumstances, and as a matter of principle, it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes.	73.09430312269768
On the other hand, Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote, for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me. I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area.	53.81454199101339
I think that it is quite obvious, and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster, that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport.	51.601418178483016
Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area, common airspace, a common rail area and a single market, but not a common maritime area. I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms.	67.08137208101644
The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation, in which we can set standards.	51.13978077568766
I have also noted, to my great satisfaction, that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty, or the eurosceptic groups are calling for Europe to regulate, and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action.	57.53873000045706
We sometimes regulate things which could, by and large, remain subsidiary.	279.85180007793014
In this area we must respond to public opinion.	21.394312881632057
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are, when all is said and done, on the global scale merely a peninsula.	106.45660996661147
Therefore, once our legislation has been brought into line, we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law. We must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the 'polluter pays' principle of responsibility which is, of course, supposed to be a deterrent.	69.83116489294075
I have almost finished and I would like to say that I have personally requested a public hearing of the Committee on Transport, which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future considerations.	63.11337718793676
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing.	56.856182169168186
Mr President, the oil tanker Erika, the ownership of which is veiled by accommodation addresses on Malta and probably in Italy and Greece and which was hired by Total-Fina for the transport of oil, foundered off the Breton coastline, with disastrous consequences.	56.64978105296447
The implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment are enormous.	55.36599555687865
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker.	27.815508085068846
So people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods.	135.29438854527
The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection.	87.37611803610625
States can carry out port inspections.	507.6741484904072
In Europe, legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25% of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive.	67.4146048013369
However, it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors.	42.196990755081224
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation.	12.840713788949197
In my opinion, the Commissioner is quite right.	28.98114181300699
Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation.	84.19857086445886
But how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors, esteemed European Commission?	66.86325698780492
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93/75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States?	125.60736328895447
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored?	286.6144114458337
Would it not be beneficial, in the short term, following the Rotterdam model, to inspect according to a points system in which, for example, account is taken of the ship' s age, whether it is single or double-hulled or whether it sails under a flag of convenience.	75.86244717918878
In short, to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements.	310.379231144735
The Erika was built at a Japanese shipyard and is single-hulled.	55.76342363584696
There are four more sister ships in service at present.	96.94898327837896
Construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high.	68.4078259261188
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag.	63.24122885654312
Are we waiting for the next accident to happen?	65.04261231917557
Would sanctions not be appropriate, as the Commissioner stated, for the classification society?	86.77452629433944
RINA is currently the talk of the town.	71.23549439172832
Malta is entering the accession negotiations.	175.44364272826022
In my opinion, the European Union can only accept Malta if it is guaranteed that the Maltese flag will sail without an accident in future.	38.620908924583865
I would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time, and this delay is going to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission.	34.477265328928134
Mr President, just before I went down into the Chamber, I received an e-mail with a quite emotional description from a Swedish woman who had chosen to spend New Year' s Eve on the French coast in Brittany instead of staying at home and celebrating with her relatives.	86.1111484386428
Like many other hundreds of volunteers, she had seen the destruction, washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there.	71.46449849528507
Like so many others, I too wonder where the people responsible are.	87.0050553702492
Where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur?	79.16768540301584
Perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime.	58.597836987395446
This is not the first time we have seen oil slicks, whether intentional or unintentional.	31.926742916441214
(The President cut the speaker off)	8.491219268411578
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament.	21.936725236804214
The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media.	40.55289433053656
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently, I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected.	94.19838185668935
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife, in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks, have brought back memories of similar British disasters, such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967, and have prompted many British volunteers to help.	83.89235049768006
I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage.	85.68149406393854
This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions.	50.81912317247683
Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London, we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10% of the lost oil.	76.96966980490774
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab.	59.42929988281897
Ultimately, the polluter must pay.	97.43997110458002
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25% of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered.	131.3803538122088
Moreover, although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice, I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations.	65.85929049730736
Rather than banning flags of convenience, which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet, under the 1995 EU directive on port state control, national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations.	110.2852469793714
I sincerely hope that, particularly during the French presidency later this year, the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options, and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament.	46.66778305058551
Mr President, it feels quite strange to be standing here again today, as I have been doing at regular intervals for almost ten years, and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence, and not by force majeure.	76.31418976650068
The victims are waiting outside.	221.67423129836027
They want answers.	225.5308668176468
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep, or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through.	73.15992794254676
The citizens are right to ask: "do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever?"	143.14671001832582
Who will provide us with new jobs?	91.15773539695327
When will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group, rather it is a joint European challenge.	112.55050151971795
That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio' s action plan with open arms.	27.825935124656556
It is equally important to note that "prevention is better than cure" .	16.893949783744258
But there is an art to that as well.	45.90834022504234
Deploying the German multipurpose ship "Neuwerk" - it is right outside my front door in Cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of European neighbourly help.	121.08018343167402
We are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew.	42.427107067277845
Valuable experiences were gained, and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone.	153.6071786702043
We are therefore right to demand improved controls, sanctions and preventive measures.	95.98425703897273
I have been fighting for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten years, here in Parliament.	69.99298103725143
The issue is as topical as it was before.	54.006891668455744
Furthermore, I will not withhold my support but will endeavour, alongside my fellow MEPs, to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation.	72.63806402767054
Mr President, firstly I would like to express my very sincere thanks, not only for the initiatives of the different groups, of Mrs Grossetête and the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, but also for the initiatives of Mr Wurtz and the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left, who proposed this debate, which has led to a positive and important discussion.	20.90687731855396
Before the end of March, I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts, that is to say, amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament.	80.76324154935843
I would like to tell you that, in fact, it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem.	17.411663585441286
There are men and women who depend on fishing, gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas. They are environmentally sensitive areas, but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium.	63.1091339633003
And therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation.	32.721413752604036
Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done.	42.37509518689337
In fact, I believe that things have been done by the Commission, but there is still more to do.	26.24937710959427
This was demonstrated by the Americans who, after the Exxon Valdez disaster, within one year, adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation, which threatens, as I said earlier, to divert ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe.	170.87341568506181
In Europe, after the Amoco Cadiz, or the Urquiola on the Spanish coast, in 1976, or the Torrey Canyon, in the same year, or the many other cases there have been, we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995, particularly in the last few years.	64.42204048899596
During these years, the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport.	98.83864709889313
That is the reality.	26.056965942744508
In my opinion, we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems, also deriving from American legislation, which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector.	43.53601031453645
I have referred to a series of issues which I will lay out in more detail, if you wish, in an appearance before a special committee on this matter, or when I present the actual initiatives in the coming months.	47.95309203260406
My intention is - and I insist - for us to begin discussions after the end of March, also coinciding with the Council of Ministers, and, of course, before the end of the six-month period of the Portuguese Presidency, for us to have texts to discuss.	50.46472927250321
Flags of convenience are one problem, but are not the only one.	48.7554263804456
The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but, nevertheless, that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections; more than the countries with flags of convenience.	55.280576491137
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community.	86.93405819267639
We must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end.	27.05754795217748
This will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the European Union, and to deal with the notorious problem, which will no doubt arise again, of the aim of a Community register.	31.58139098347197
I believe that this will be difficult but, in any event, we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries.	21.59968657995513
As for the inspections, very much a key question, the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked, as Mr Hatzidakis has said.	67.78565235842576
We already have legislation.	145.4557257427418
According to the information which the Commission services have given me, this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel, means and inspectors.	66.50442494822863
The problem is not that only 25% are inspected, but rather how we select, how we find, the ships which constitute the highest risk, through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags.	152.90139897208624
Unfortunately, the 25% often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements: in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily.	73.93874361156628
Therefore, more than making amendments, we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done, apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews, especially in relation to the age of the different vessels.	62.888729009889836
And that is why we have SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) and MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), two conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitored.	40.953856199439066
With regard to the question of Union inspectors, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States, which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately.	25.13304014599747
Lastly, I would like to stress the issue of liability. Not only in terms of maximum sums insured, which I believe should be similar to those in the United States.	26.609038563069458
We have set a figure of USD 180 million; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments.	72.72127395531882
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States, but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and, therefore, the liability of shipowners, and also to hold liable those who charter ships, which is to say the owners of the cargo.	89.45543413354682
Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable, we will never, in my opinion, resolve these problems.	76.00989094257292
I will end now.	80.35563429336248
I will not expand further. We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions.	27.786489501373886
But, obviously, as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done.	58.06388915750265
As for me, I can say, after having debated it in the College of Commissioners, that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures, amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council, in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety.	55.36390995160681
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers.	24.95301764104042
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	6.573406575229789
We have taken good note of your intentions.	43.47413885120243
I have received 8 motions for resolution, in accordance with Rule 37(2), to close the present Commission statement.	58.24904999436056
The debate is closed.	3.77548916318001
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	5.325701709630239
Storms in Europe	108.59842226253899
The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe.	11.454917383595905
Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	11.781489434244039
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward, particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union, in terms of the help that we can offer them.	31.52714927099838
In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2.	73.4360071017915
I think that you must have done so, because you have not mentioned it.	31.612262323586005
In fact, we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid.	64.08269571338622
We should therefore put this situation right immediately.	62.75716092448228
You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one.	34.87659544539326
Let me explain.	64.45879067923
I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest.	66.15647705594448
Indeed, for some 'forestry' districts, which have lost 20% of their trees, this represents a huge loss.	135.5990407037826
We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity, so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one, two or five years, but over many more.	125.58544390323542
The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years.	88.13816832718415
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues.	74.9109737757335
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies.	16.981341344891156
It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one.	20.324847618735973
Indeed, you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate.	76.12774006945848
On the other hand, districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer, as the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years.	36.929500249879624
Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case.	140.11812394544293
I am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is, and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could.	56.550677131013686
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, although there has indeed been an economic disaster, the real ecological catastrophes are still to come.	23.64213790564132
As you yourself said, Commissioner, these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes, and we think that these are the first signs of climate change.	85.64975473870203
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact.	31.28116165344758
Mr President, everyone who has travelled here by car, train or aeroplane, has been able to see the extent of the damage, particularly in France, caused by hurricanes of a completely unprecedented violence which struck Europe at the end of last month.	64.35458657440537
What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster?	50.59046079727179
Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who, on a daily basis, have had to reassure their constituents, organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services.	54.79383618204702
They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens.	53.03029437756538
Next, I would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the Union' s Member States who, in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation, came to support the efforts of their French colleagues.	57.77662939669719
I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid.	24.975539810222852
If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey, we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims, but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so.	66.72782829688444
We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly.	91.32541276489881
I am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies, which have been particularly badly hit.	58.17360559795869
As you said, Commissioner, we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to FIFG for investments that have been totally wiped out.	43.72254965122881
Beyond this, I think that implementing MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected.	38.71900580208709
I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and, on the contrary, to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments, which they urgently need.	50.83686441921565
Mr President, the storms which devastated France during the night between 26 and 27 December have caused, as has been said, 90 deaths and damage to a value of FF 75 billion, i.e. EUR 11 billion.	84.59831688944716
Almost three weeks after the disaster, several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones, 500 000 hectares of forestry land, or 100 million cubic metres of forest, have been ruined, and our historical heritage has also been affected, as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrates.	65.49828781530512
It seems quite natural that given such a disaster, national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected.	67.76251324270415
As the previous speakers have said, and as you said, Commissioner, in response to my fellow Member, Mr Martinez, with regard to another tragedy, the floods in November in the Southwest of France, you have certainly noted these disasters with concern, but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued, which has resulted in this shocking paradox. This paradox, pointed out by the previous speaker, is that it is easier, a great deal easier, to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the Union than within it.	62.80263338408852
We know full well that what you are doing, Commissioner, and that is, limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b.	80.82973874847667
These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000.	79.43677134226013
I can show you a copy if you wish.	70.33487507358132
We would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission, but also of this Parliament, and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so.	51.184791538794855
But for pity' s sake, and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way, please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms.	66.0780374784667
As a matter of urgency, therefore, we must restore, within the framework of a supplementary budget, the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters.	61.58122509050818
We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union. That, however, is another problem altogether.	85.5662756312359
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium.	30.904646173267516
I would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated Europe in December.	28.518249459122853
These storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests.	129.43696278944188
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region, Lorraine, which have suffered enormous destruction.	108.75232899494148
I would like to congratulate the regional authorities, the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but, unfortunately, their troubles are not yet over.	39.72085723825735
It is Europe's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster.	41.46732340670481
I welcome Mr Barnier' s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced.	25.24751708288908
I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter, as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this.	38.897608839447464
The Community action programme for civil protection, established by a Council decision on 9 December, was launched on 1 January 2000.	49.743410100392964
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity. This programme must work at full capacity.	93.3257977525397
Although it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry.	50.33479774131999
Our priority, as we wait for Community-level funds to be freed up, is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States.	85.31803483341794
It is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads, and to repair them as quickly as possible.	25.752895752092865
Lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure.	341.55101312298035
Our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest, and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood.	73.42287689440744
Finally, it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood, in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls.	24.239609293867428
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States.	53.7287366927454
This aid for gathering timber is, of course, only the first stage of an aid package, which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural areas.	48.745302753883145
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over.	41.05706627332323
This is a very sad opportunity for Europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies.	41.36776660593526
It is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic calamity.	20.40488817256747
If this solidarity is to have been worthwhile, it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry.	132.5107684873826
Hurricane "Lothar" should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here -, but to switch to the precautionary principle, under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too.	80.34873760992589
Current programmes must be accelerated.	53.75203019163539
For example, as they stand, the Commission' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under Kyoto.	98.19254293616032
The trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem, it shelves it.	90.26165467901201
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term.	38.36867432903318
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources, as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases.	54.15949724537954
The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject, and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate!	52.449636831085634
Commissioner, Mr President, Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto.	116.27865997996795
However, it has now achieved notoriety.	50.84893782383274
The hurricane of the same name swept across Europe claiming numerous victims, mainly in France and Germany, but also in Switzerland, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.	74.0188550373704
The wind triumphed over electricity pylons, roofs, traffic signs and, ultimately over the forest.	118.38285117387436
We have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber, and this is only an estimate.	55.81870519024303
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner, and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany.	63.927714923340446
If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days, then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual.	70.48091801188495
What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region, or in a 5b region?	90.85457738997563
What answer will the Commission give, when it is on the scene, when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building, and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc.? All this is well-intentioned advice.	146.84106270213746
However, I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage.	38.15039064503976
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree.	51.890156253199144
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid, so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date.	49.177703507654826
Mr President, Commissioner, permit me, first of all, to make reference to two facts.	37.838631707208094
Firstly, at the beginning of 1999, NATO, with the participation of most Member States of the European Union, flattened Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom.	43.754991579411886
We are now endeavouring, at huge cost, to get the country back on its feet again and help its people, and rightly so.	114.3015467579162
Secondly, at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU.	62.43173590338094
The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders.	56.26929379097709
"We do not have the wherewithal for that," they said.	26.35899486775184
This is wrong!	36.632731163788115
And no one can comprehend this attitude.	71.027779435963
Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss.	148.757636699344
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity, also from within this Community.	97.09100986313847
I say they have a right to solidarity.	47.214308321578024
Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need.	85.66221214517698
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms.	32.19809015466661
It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority.	83.04848001492812
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will.	74.86380207040388
Permit me one further comment. Although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm, the tanker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter.	67.28582335098972
The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency.	38.68731838715274
We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations.	43.833280693721136
We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment.	159.39165346306132
Then, for example, people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart.	238.62859607059679
When, in 1994, over five years ago that is, I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament, I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier.	55.10945027351546
To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission, which will actually enable me to start work.	63.757206819593456
It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste, and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again!	56.62277477166527
Mr President, Commissioner, the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems.	51.45940661710787
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters.	32.60027228257355
There have always been natural disasters and there always will be.	75.69395504975914
Of course, there is a need for solidarity here.	24.96965732596058
There is certainly a need for European civil protection, and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters.	50.53285073210772
But, most importantly, it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature, for nature cannot make mistakes.	96.10635441225834
The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density, the type of infrastructure, and, of course, the many monocultures, if we are talking forests.	50.5489975917061
Of course, I am in favour of providing assistance where we can.	32.255216463253284
But when it comes to aid, we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future, more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground.	36.39641433562425
We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation, rather than monocultures.	44.07648154989838
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate.	38.463865351945955
To this day, we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream, and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff.	64.2291698233523
America and south-east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go.	128.43108488229547
We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream.	30.697353772547224
But in common with others, we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect.	68.29616311810459
This is partly the work of human hand, as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations.	83.81490047926262
We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference.	52.33411828799076
We must reduce CO2 emissions, employ renewable energies, and generally make enquiries, in this connection, as to how the forests of Europe are faring.	93.31284879937382
Mr President, I think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims.	31.764315507865042
This is an irreparable loss.	19.49041915429758
Secondly, we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens, and the solidarity of other countries with France, which is the country worst affected.	64.9471880191375
As I have little time, Mr President, I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution.	34.018348915311876
I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not.	39.51353895692629
That is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities, in general terms, are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years.	55.197631665935866
In fact, over the last decade, the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century.	27.071640653283936
Therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals.	71.3686022628469
Secondly, I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner' s proposal to create a European civil protection body.	37.49458525641596
Furthermore, we should utilise an extraordinary budget line, since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation.	54.28190506349937
First of all, we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy.	51.62285399710096
It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards.	104.9084529099909
It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this.	28.73897439141614
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this.	33.750485695643576
That is important.	36.31700576429505
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past.	34.73936552125412
It was very small.	42.44347695883212
It was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major.	65.95942018066978
Officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels, whispering with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies.	72.83902555093292
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished.	68.21538175013171
I think we should reinstate this budget line.	34.8614733244044
When we had the earthquake in Greece, which was a big disaster, the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks.	81.22220444017051
The same when the floods came in France and the same again now.	101.46687392207363
These are major disasters, we should have an instrument, we do not have it.	42.82141615413019
We should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument.	111.58243458388954
We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it.	88.8355865523894
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic.	69.84615064307951
We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these.	43.683590680079334
Ladies and gentlemen, none of us must forget what has taken place.	31.99408044217417
It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines.	32.337028873572606
It is also true that there is a lot of European money around. Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development, forestry would be eligible under Article 33, companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in Article 87(2) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds.	58.762112111744734
It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical, active solidarity.	82.46614519942936
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul.	60.47566418726974
This is inadequate, and I am personally delighted that Mr Barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which, moreover, I expressed when I told the press in Bordeaux what I am hoping for, and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of European civil security.	60.78755974252623
If the European citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being, if the mandate that our President, Mrs Fontaine has staked on a closer relationship between the Union and Europe' s citizens is to be effective, our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency.	56.9889103286155
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force, real civil relief blue helmets, who would go to areas in difficulty within the Union, as we currently have no emergency procedure, but also outside the Union if needs be, in Venezuela or anywhere else, is something that we should hope to see. I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit.	84.00723767391864
Mr President, Commissioner, when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation, we see that Europe gets off relatively lightly.	51.44574090121537
Nevertheless, the storms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us.	63.877011146736955
Anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in Alsace as well.	123.77379875193631
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously, and at the same time, from my position here in this Chamber, point to how important it is to support these regions and people.	42.53939483799681
Each and every one of us knows that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow.	130.9701562578546
What we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible.	35.17503471115665
For it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long.	83.2105648373506
For instance, it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle' s larvae, and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have.	47.50815382314386
That is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives.	19.32328995694151
Decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry.	79.10651614396025
For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow.	59.94884134476133
The calculations are in decades rather than years.	79.1440196319326
In addition, I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production, for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions.	37.56842584687163
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared.....	36.03428148818043
(The President cut the speaker off)	8.491221292876252
Mr President, I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms.	29.06391986176931
Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries.	44.48938646055358
We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank.	63.85721590849928
I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland.	36.354863778541734
We had high winds and unprecedented, prolonged rainfall which, adding to existing difficulties, resulted in thousands of acres being submerged, sometimes, in up to 15 feet of water.	114.79000984643629
We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms, no sanitation, no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water.	107.20089009173536
I talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water.	110.09147248617043
Natural habitats were destroyed.	220.4943599471668
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case.	41.24444824536704
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force.	89.79938655722214
Mr President, Commissioner, I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims.	80.30652748446522
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe.	22.11507701879142
For the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of Europe, and I believe we need, in the long-term, to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future.	36.71650653400463
We certainly do not want market organisation for forests, but maybe we should set up a system, perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector, which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way.	49.92045847447163
Unfortunately, we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future.	57.35399473380173
As has already been mentioned here, there are indications - no proof, but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe.	105.28209752260007
Of course, the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet, but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing, these storms will, of course, hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century.	69.83416178572656
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours, Tom Spencer. He suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women, we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time.	79.62923702870772
However, an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP, for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate, rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability.	78.95837406806544
We must be aware of this connection; I do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm, but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course!	71.12871202464326
I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	16.742489537264017
That concludes the debate.	29.09378695997705
The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday.	22.106442112092267
Food safety	156.34675668075775
The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission.	18.303574816900536
Mr President, I am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to Parliament the main lines of the Commission's White Paper on food safety, adopted on Wednesday last, 12 January, in association with my colleague, Mr Liikanen.	56.69974959806688
At my hearing last September, I promised speedy delivery of this White Paper.	65.89975147503476
I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly.	17.33186460323722
The White Paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new Commission was appointed last September.	77.61908334460644
It takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the Commission's Green Paper on food law was published.	42.55055270134634
Equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge, as well as the BSE crisis.	92.78622887456798
The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed.	38.31631146616407
I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months.	31.592627130641127
The Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world.	60.787211914314476
When I launched the White Paper last week I said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth.	34.3208817181421
The most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe.	31.71239823674102
If their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions. This in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers, producers and industry generally.	116.7093282900715
In an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually, even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects.	222.03624056087537
Between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees.	58.35817017390917
High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness.	139.26113259704044
This crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and European level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety.	76.94053393390058
In saying all of this, I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems.	31.73248614730891
The challenge is to make the system the very best.	63.19405268466113
The overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food.	42.295023755097866
We are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change.	47.42474841077448
The Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule.	31.7794579487486
We will also need the fullest support from the Council and other key stakeholders.	51.70894525060114
The White Paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing EU food legislation.	63.972906858305635
All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent, understandable and flexible.	40.55666524559325
We want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers.	74.74063884290113
The detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years.	31.286778039200975
Over 80 measures are envisaged.	311.60590770367736
Our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002.	67.48890248465285
We are also envisaging the establishment of a European food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime.	34.07689292680533
This idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate.	89.3618112976518
It has already attracted much comment, including reactions from Members of Parliament.	101.03091310671095
The chapter of the White Paper devoted to the establishment of a European food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments.	32.036848591791525
We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage.	85.8438464825073
I will return to this process of consultation in a few moments.	35.80564949556456
The Commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence.	49.571539667717005
Why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change?	92.84668575905327
The first key concern is independence.	99.93713134454633
Key stakeholders, including consumers, are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests.	104.88664460468281
We must also ensure excellence and transparency.	29.89136540866408
We have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the BSE crisis.	23.545064778848978
However, the Commission believes that we must go further.	21.321221115206118
We must create a permanent and truly independent, excellent and transparent system of risk assessment.	84.9724445827269
The key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety.	34.68692715403751
We envisage that the work of the existing five Scientific Committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority.	61.332573072269234
They may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority's establishment.	85.20200506572289
However, if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs, this would clearly not be enough.	59.96410812434395
As the White Paper makes clear, the new authority must be a value-added structure.	80.72739584505445
I am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened.	29.310635306809026
Within the authority I envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists.	169.84006120005037
I am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react, identify issues before they become crises.	98.03497349596347
This proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority.	33.57742703594816
To be proactive the White Paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embraced by the authority.	39.013017347379424
These include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function, the coordination of scientific information in the EU, and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in Member States.	84.37134847654335
As part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns.	138.29413100240657
The Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority.	60.40300967769751
We believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	83.32130008754254
I make no apology for this approach; I firmly believe that it is the correct one.	32.507352461523
Certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority.	103.27382314190257
I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion.	39.98363019392317
It was only last year that the Treaty was amended to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process.	39.65112321975696
To give such a role to an authority at this stage would be, in my view, a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability.	71.85564362774161
I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter.	26.895341330048684
There are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority.	34.639539327964776
I also reject this line of argument.	73.24502793583109
How could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety?	217.33090267219595
Would this be in the interests of Europe's citizens?	50.154677495919586
In my view, most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based, rationally argued and fully justified.	104.91760774690206
It seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving.	51.74660981320863
I can assure you here today that the Commission, in exercising its risk management functions, will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority.	43.01838894248986
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States.	32.930885673494664
This is a major task.	16.946602922082857
We must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the European Union.	31.579493583700025
The authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues.	44.86678762447505
This situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself.	93.87835203665549
I do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science.	26.84058438657959
However, with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies, the authority will become pre-eminent on the European stage.	113.29167488185024
I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard.	18.527316243377417
As an integral part of a value-added structure, the White Paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication: to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer-friendly way; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-the-minute data on risk; to be highly visible; to tell the good news story about food; to be proactive.	104.29560203649244
The White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls.	44.62599240987385
This is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that Member States and operators are complying with Community legislation.	33.27949572920126
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena.	38.2162734960773
In this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in Dublin.	65.12137536554118
This revised Community framework would have three core elements: operational criteria set up at Community level, Community control guidelines, and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control.	107.24808180646727
As part of our proposals in this area - which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year - I will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the Commission.	36.48758218810405
These could include withholding Community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a Member State.	103.98489253908156
These proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world, boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union.	54.1605560914209
In addition to the proposals for a new European food authority and an enhanced control system at Community-level, the White Paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the Community's legislation, covering all aspects of food products from farm to table.	53.20599945243215
It sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation.	129.57998608785604
The new legal framework will cover animal feed, animal health and welfare, hygiene, contaminants and residues, novel food, additives, flavourings, packaging and irradiation.	56.73874970620207
It will include a proposal on general food law which will embody the principles of food safety such as responsibility of feed manufacturers, farmers and food operators, traceability of feed, food and ingredients, proper risk analysis through, for instance, risk assessment - that is, scientific advice and information analysis - risk management - that is, regulation and control - risk communication, and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate.	205.20537888361596
As regards the precautionary principle, I might add that the Commission is currently finalising a communication which I expect to be adopted very soon.	28.608516479863695
I look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available.	53.185744886518876
However, having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees, I recognise that this was not feasible.	40.05415908085915
But I know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the White Paper's proposals on the authority.	38.49620495249177
We now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the Commission's ideas on the White Paper on the establishment of a European food authority.	19.700814138165388
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate.	35.07121386796593
Parliament played a crucial role in Europe's response to the BSE crisis.	38.769413956452404
It has especially active since then in bringing citizens' concerns about food safety issues to the fore.	192.70230663084646
I expect that Parliament's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive.	38.07373591104143
While we have a number of months to the end of April to debate the issue and garner our views, I recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe.	57.423666338243834
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible.	25.07774526892718
It is essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament's contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the European Union's food safety regime.	38.862569241310226
The European food authority will be a key ingredient in the EU's food safety regime in the years ahead.	29.725193527581013
It is essential that we get the mix right.	30.468015918469128
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his statement.	8.746442540138863
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions, including the Commission and Parliament.	38.15049069855218
That is very much the right approach.	45.07278198364631
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight.	38.773435021601145
I hope that we can thrash this out.	16.95984035028015
We need a body of food law, as you have said, and we need to agree this together.	36.6641168551916
It is very important that we include liability in that process.	39.990399083427995
That is the one word I am talking about.	23.08651885834092
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong.	165.67085098053852
That cannot continue.	145.06292391953443
When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem, those responsible are liable.	82.31697114770351
Mr President, it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority.	38.718830407207754
My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed.	129.05584631023882
You are unclear about this in your White Paper.	43.92191870752091
What is your schedule, how long will it take you to produce a positive list?	92.56421345153318
When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof?	91.1129749723616
The final part of my question is as follows: when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States?	62.05571957810859
That is another point, i.e. the question of obligation, which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper.	59.4142825883228
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement.	14.603675184017693
I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality.	50.89677473083177
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency, so there is not very much point in your proposing one.	88.7986562160422
Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs.	110.85165048621089
However, as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years, I have to ask: if Europe has the safest food control system, as you have said, why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives?	160.4025810523253
Secondly, will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States?	60.773879999876144
We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this.	42.498004457863864
Regarding enlargement: what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws, given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003?	79.09874601476157
President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern, Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper.	21.94801997877194
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised.	44.30406447605973
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability.	78.46534561313213
That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability.	34.71076123144077
Once that is done, issues such as liability can be addressed.	109.64354791462388
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background, but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved.	153.5083289156506
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration.	44.735374330621326
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list.	40.907531950163566
That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation, and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material.	40.95889481603323
At the moment the list is, as I say, a negative list and it is added to as required.	65.79042580575793
The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it, 2002 in fact.	53.92584506562166
The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation.	39.00435867876812
Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed.	161.75663439844803
This is unfortunate and it is wrong, and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done.	34.80114994668072
The work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in Member States is ongoing, I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming along quickly but I understand it is in inter-service consultation in the Commission and work is currently under way.	66.10142089490239
I hope that the next time you ask me the question, I will be in a position to give you more detailed information.	35.539596814390286
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation.	83.87891056972107
I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation.	44.259574717548126
It is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation, although that is part of it, but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them.	57.209994434153465
There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind.	24.092101552518223
Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen.	62.96995808118523
Commissioner, the ignorance of certain Member States has landed us in a major food crisis here in Europe, and I am afraid that once more I have cause to be angry at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in attendance, and that on the day that you present your interesting report.	59.275990489788704
What I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind, whatever name it goes by, will be given influence over the Council, who in this authority will have the say in matters, and who will issue orders.	101.04661947312798
Of course, we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content, but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam, and even extending them.	76.7943974147854
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that.	58.450741609236886
I also welcome the White Paper.	14.412145231942599
But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France's refusal to lift the ban?	68.47319378253411
You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting.	60.299093703170364
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance, similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment?	55.04715354051966
Mr President, you said during last week' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery, but you did not mention what that periphery was.	131.77078529668526
For example, the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters.	90.22765939482845
It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather, publish and coordinate data, make recommendations for improved food safety, and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers.	79.23060204735398
All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union.	42.33094784008894
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location?	64.8066470754397
In relation to the makeup of the authority: first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time.	57.66111748769661
In addition to that, the food safety authority will have a board.	41.53751815244213
You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board.	45.778983988334396
This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months.	27.810136899253838
I envisage that the board's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders.	56.142979908395915
Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September.	42.78242371944552
We have not done that yet but it will be done in September.	32.971572851789034
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work.	51.534976999869905
That would erode the independence of the scientific advice.	42.305925876885645
But it would have an overall remit, particularly, for instance, in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research.	194.1515593218559
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that.	76.44927762681614
That is an issue for consideration and discussion.	48.95517785503305
There may be a number of views on that.	23.794099906730825
Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board.	53.68015779647253
Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament, through nominees or even MEPs themselves, were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated.	74.27284868154615
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out.	25.40090597098658
Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity.	64.8840724416244
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile.	35.61387501722079
It must be visible.	31.367876579020272
It must be known.	36.30893680002929
Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority.	35.98277946603151
The CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known, who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food, particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition, diet and such issues, so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority.	94.64239935095253
They will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority.	63.25537349323487
It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous.	31.154297823099018
It must be visible.	31.367876579020272
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority.	74.06789594847268
Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth.	44.64307234103489
I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end.	71.74550263725865
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level.	52.21574177706626
Quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for, or advising, the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level.	103.84773494884243
That is an undesirable situation, we do not want that situation in the future.	22.8884387197345
There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one.	58.89878404307079
But information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern.	108.12707662715803
We must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists, that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond, where experts are to be found elsewhere.	77.10742542614133
Over time, as I said a moment ago, not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise, its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged.	101.0448367258881
This situation can be achieved over a period of time.	33.12323767804897
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence. It is something that is earned over a period of time.	59.67763396332139
However, the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	48.24780829579891
I realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but, nonetheless, the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward.	62.906934167888835
Any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way.	37.798002958907325
One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance.	45.63326689398015
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process.	56.5707160204772
In relation to grants and subsidies: yes, consideration has been given to that issue.	90.03048150295808
It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought, particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling.	58.810073823384215
In relation to Mrs Lynne's question on interim payments: that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues.	62.4689592101011
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority.	43.67377045827299
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	42.03601795497186
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and, although I come from that part of the world myself, I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe!	36.0424612790134
But the FVO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority.	51.12034934612839
The FVO is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin.	83.47925993650946
The Food Safety Authority's situation is quite different.	64.97550006686483
It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation.	23.083111975883842
An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean, what problems they have identified, what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise.	86.04851215131876
Equally, the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process, to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified.	75.42085871689143
It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located.	38.082750921764514
Scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and, in those circumstances, as scientists will have to travel, it is probably better that they move to a central location, once again where the parliamentary structures and the Commission and Council are based.	74.8165530432499
That is my judgement at the moment.	22.798590921821532
It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	44.633611060778726
Colleagues, I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda.	48.228889284982564
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the Conference of Presidents.	38.43944289636259
If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important, I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them.	83.23243022663871
On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner, and his statement.	67.14121424309992
As you can see, half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session.	122.67315994799422
I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions.	62.235148795732776
That concludes the debate.	29.09378695997705
Question Time (Commission)	519.4048513732919
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	31.25056894939952
We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time.	256.5092989043724
We will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session.	186.70464883918365
Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion.	20.344628188791276
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda.	50.744699298458166
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda.	19.757706828869125
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m., and you can see the clock.	40.93496690697237
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event.	32.06241613868533
First Part	205.55499927257594
Question No 28 by (H-0781/99):	11.889249338885785
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.	76.43553575820314
Turkey's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	67.72010127946619
What steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	72.2651922964911
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	13.684947822988704
The Commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in Akkuyu, Turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards.	102.74094587679687
According to our information, the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet.	53.718323229696054
The Commission acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Turkey rests entirely with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority.	76.30636643763488
The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production, including the nuclear option.	71.64123516565566
As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999, the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue.	39.08915863241894
In particular, the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site.	41.27805296841098
According to information received from the International Atomic Agency, the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in Adana.	67.31050076399666
Large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site.	68.08747307229153
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material.	72.80509994419694
It acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.	71.0979222245046
Thank you for your reply.	9.993457870664631
I should like to make the following points: Turkey is now a candidate country.	31.030500792060813
This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2%.	69.34521304684792
At the same time, it also wishes to acquire Cadou type reactors from Canada, which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India.	49.61987837717482
In this sense, there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology.	58.03980644587128
So much for the political aspect.	59.38686456893115
Now to the technical aspect. The safety factor in this type of project, and I am speaking as an engineer, has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty.	73.71253055085299
In cases such as this, where there is uncertainty, simulators are used.	76.21167684582589
However, we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy.	101.41110345287993
In this sense, all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this.	79.89314847220551
Therefore, and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed, it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union.	51.1549994967005
A couple of weeks ago we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries.	58.71987320244772
I have explained the position of the Commission.	22.47631400342684
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety.	21.07039483949001
So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable.	76.2454447042367
In the case of Turkey it is different.	32.981172573410966
The plant is not yet there.	71.08453214374045
I have already said that Turkey is part of the NPT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety.	20.648269640041857
If we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey.	129.0508002418054
If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.	79.60490186315104
Mr President, the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty, it has signed the nuclear safety treaties: why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community, and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter?	68.15142990046789
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concerns and fears.	36.146140897969644
I do not have these concerns.	18.364841721725114
I believe that Turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty, but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament.	38.387569196891995
Question No 29 by (H-0786/99):	11.648126586317648
Subject: Depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict?	87.4397624065768
If not, why not?	115.78518732410045
Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	12.353016447339948
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for your question.	16.43567001361483
The European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action.	43.531744428328544
As early as last June the Commission financed a first study. It was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe.	60.70984065473384
None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment.	185.87746060897112
The Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force.	67.23482851937327
This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it.	42.80397180746364
The use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the Net.	60.06203363617421
The Balkan Task Force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict.	94.82982496489865
No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission.	67.29018696826616
However, this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium.	47.21601938136402
From a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks, if any, are limited to an area around the target.	89.97022812435759
Future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe. A special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed.	70.34936510376073
It will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed.	117.87089330852366
First of all, Mr President, can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response.	24.54849265975357
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue.	37.405431452395774
But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used.	24.673827696331337
This uranium becomes air-borne, is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far.	100.91218265303792
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war.	44.489248568515315
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects, not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo?	67.05933673318718
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons?	52.5281892788227
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for that question.	26.488230352003402
We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of Kosovo.	58.40950636262142
But those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium.	92.76437495127912
That is also mentioned in the report.	22.01773738770313
No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.	35.57729756279447
The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted.	48.12807104050629
A big responsibility rests with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report, so they have to take responsibility.	59.467171644281194
But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is, for the time being, the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union.	68.47156127383839
It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States, as well as the United Nations and the Commission, something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment.	32.490244177280346
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons.	27.427262601935215
Mr President, Commissioner, in a few months' time, hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday.	60.303895620057254
We know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast.	134.99499109001042
Are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer, and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect?	45.89785572805062
I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to.	61.80179204918076
We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this.	135.82495206832908
That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do.	76.05209106505161
What we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous.	46.34421741865602
In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution.	40.619730114297155
That also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system.	78.17904434449099
Unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise.	54.92997376624893
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area?	55.476750951817735
I cannot answer that question.	88.17410921158536
When it comes to medical checks and so on, I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer.	46.68812666424077
What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned, that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan, but when it comes to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that.	56.49291965639206
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information.	45.00663404789642
Question No 30 by (H-0793/99):	16.13079612161019
Subject: Appointment of a European Union envoy for Tibet In 1998 the Tibetan Government in exile received over 4000 Tibetans who escaped over the Himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb.	70.9405872661435
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way.	73.52079719495946
The Tibet Intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibetans daily in Tibet.	35.39502365910849
The Tibet Intergroup, therefore, gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in Tibet and supporting the Dalai Lama?s proposal for dialogue with the Chinese Government to resolve the situation in Tibet, calls on the Commission to appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet to address the concerns of the European Union and to help bring the Tibetan and Chinese authorities together for dialogue.	60.93809500398879
When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet?	59.09100270428425
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	9.332332498411208
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared.	74.76106284519909
I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues, including Tibet, firmly and candidly to the Chinese authorities.	44.41779319159416
The European Union did that at the European Union­China Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues, including Tibet.	68.01997594505697
We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama.	118.68139240327321
I urge the Chinese again to do so.	45.54416124999713
We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities.	42.338033357097444
We are also doing a number of other things: in the European Union-China human rights dialogue, we have focused on a number of practical steps, including sending experts on assignment to Tibet, planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health, education and training for Tibetans.	84.35292450996376
The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them.	98.06779518517071
But for my part, I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts.	37.838992566241075
It would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in exile.	52.2670203082562
I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys, however worthy the cause.	73.5702097365803
Mr President, Mr Patten, of course, you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China, and you are well aware of how hard the Tibetans are trying to initiate a debate, something which has always been blocked hitherto.	55.500617029330435
However, if your response was to be that we should turn to "Mr CFSP" , that is, to Mr Solana, then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter.	56.08267035731232
Your approach, which I am very much in favour of, since it is a coherent one, takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights.	46.64322227780807
Imprisonment, torture, the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth, are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum.	64.8956137659604
If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this, then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve.	68.98431013244158
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place, but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation, would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission, rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council.	41.37779833457632
Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is.	54.41217814209413
I stated nothing but the truth when I said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the Council.	74.54260563285331
As it happens, we deal with the budgetary consequences, the Council makes the appointment.	88.5466531822591
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course.	73.88341124360167
Putting that on one side, because that is the situation, it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues.	54.563288053338844
I am very much hoping in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out, among other things, that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in China or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the European Union.	30.445309414661327
I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world.	71.64786274557713
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet.	52.48281049244053
During the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice, first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest.	58.76757625769494
If I can make a literary commendation to the honourable Member, who I recognise is interested in these subjects, I recommend to him a book published just before Christmas written by Isabel Hilton, the distinguished journalist, on the problems of Tibet.	63.12938965427203
Mr President, I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting, which betokens peace and happiness.	26.689762414827754
We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned, rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace, serenity, compassion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans.	59.489236827140935
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness, the Dalai Lama' s, proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair?	57.221234836925426
I would point out that doing nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people.	47.617356477718005
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition.	47.02171615916256
Like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama.	24.901544237229135
It is an extremely moving account, not just of his responsibilities in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual views as well.	107.44028404034896
The Commission, like others, has urged dialogue.	288.34147926924
The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes.	62.532438861314716
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama.	60.3157151400214
At or around the time of President Clinton's visit to China, the President of the People's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda.	93.59715936254672
It would be very beneficial, not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue.	47.61430265564191
Question No 31 by (H-0795/99):	10.79550546245276
Subject: Commission's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU According to newspaper reports, the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jacob Söderman for a citizens? right to proper administration in the EU.	106.76187542422836
Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration, it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made, but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service.	94.66049781533003
Are these reports accurate?	295.4784100645186
What is the reason for the Commission?s acting in this way, and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration?	42.94127885144211
Does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September, and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it?	69.87156716451221
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	9.332332498411208
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate.	36.66288433757161
In November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure.	58.08751098914841
At the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document, a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks.	45.80464039183582
The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading.	50.154474213613504
It should be noted that the new Commission gave an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code.	45.31414053230137
The Commission would like to stress in particular that, in the drafting of the code, it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman.	35.87699365541256
The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission's administration with the public.	68.51235300087389
It will be adopted through a legally-binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.	40.54520855101297
The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman's office.	49.27983931258119
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself.	60.42957132842506
However, it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform.	40.993400599388735
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner.	5.323648291063935
However, I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force, bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997.	33.274735399643696
The newspaper reports were misleading.	35.764636930763146
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman.	22.874265748199004
There is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are soundly placed on that.	40.20533777582024
I want to repeat that honourable Members, like the honourable Member who asked the question, who take a particular interest in this issue, will want to have a dialogue about it.	58.44483315295225
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member.	21.00605589161146
I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer.	20.855206237482186
For safety' s sake, I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that, where the Commission and good administration are concerned, there is no part of Jacob Söderman' s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable.	43.33700840530502
Is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved?	29.142862417669605
Let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true! "I would like to stress again that the Commission has accepted all the Ombudsman's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999".	56.04585829542849
Both documents, that is the Commission's document and the Ombudsman's draft, cover largely the same ground.	112.80130398748977
The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis.	60.02272404716731
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue.	42.76696312466701
We will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten' s notes into the bibliography, as another bedside book for the Members to bear in mind.	47.21469105325159
As the author is not present, Question No 32 lapses.	55.44094464054055
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy. I am sorry.	51.94276210452311
According to the Rules of Procedure, you are not required to reply.	31.815726102835583
I wish you a good evening.	117.85622465844251
Second Part	406.7216805184345
Questions to Mr Nielson, who is replaced by Mr Patten	50.29879636862022
Can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague, Mr Nielson, was that he could not be here but the honourable Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is, trying to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survives.	76.30054494596199
The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development, part of the so-called induction courses for new staff, something that has been done already but not, I admit, on a regular basis.	55.81729453713223
The training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point.	113.84175825752484
The training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory.	107.38199838642333
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management.	161.74352256233573
As far as possible, we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset, instead of having to be tackled separately and later.	43.40804980056878
My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on.	43.29560581217441
The quest for equality should permeate the work of the Directorate-General for Development at all levels.	34.98446074088678
It is not to be brought in as a "sort of optional add-on" .	29.7597061635644
This must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies, together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women' s and men' s priorities and needs are better reflected.	76.05321527171293
In addition, measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender.	52.18141816142756
Equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals, action plans and strategies.	159.58717922278734
It would appear that we are in agreement about this.	36.65507935475087
However, responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers.	99.36753540302321
If the latter do not have the required professional competence, then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority.	89.83724713715019
Extremely few members of the Directorate-General for Development, that is to say unit managers and more senior managers, have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised.	66.08916090226198
Only one manager has participated in gender training, and for half a day.	95.01576414114194
That is naturally unacceptable.	41.34808505247676
What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training?	59.68036585113405
Gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees, but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course.	131.92374720064043
This limited training element has, however, been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times.	64.20617317323831
As I point out in my question, one to two days, and not one to two hours, need to be devoted to the subject.	73.53959038861345
My question is this: is the Commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate-General for Development?	70.52075465168518
Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson.	173.93885058296848
I must not go on about books, but I have just been reading the book by David Landis Barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues, in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies, going back millennia.	98.88795731196451
Secondly, in my view, while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential. And, since it should be essential, I would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training.	76.19525268298973
That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority.	97.5678281629005
It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves.	102.72223313347523
Thirdly, one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground.	97.87635010825139
So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said.	27.893972483175627
I hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves.	69.34481625149127
Since 1991, the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia.	53.27601759147979
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme.	38.903952712946364
In 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million.	36.518521371651254
This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors, in particular agriculture, infrastructure development, the private economy and the strengthening of institutions.	120.76046278147858
Security considerations have prevented Tajikistan from benefiting fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999.	89.2260279806304
In addition to national programmes, the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy, transport and environmental sectors.	70.28394886884506
Food security programmes in central Asia began in 1996, following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind.	174.23046476229268
These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent, Tajikistan.	42.0903130051851
Funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999.	62.73875978076913
Over the same period, Kyrgyzstan received EUR 17 million.	87.32501103974614
Since 1993 the Commission's European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.	52.56421978073827
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million, mainly for food, medical supplies, water and sanitation.	78.71988155753861
Frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process.	102.37622214031053
Mr President, Commissioner, there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century.	31.887831632427943
That is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular. That is why I would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence, how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going, that is, with regard to political relations that is.	41.57101476291332
Of course, that falls within your remit; my next question falls within Mr Nielson' s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation, in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the cotton monocultures, which are the cause of great aridity.	94.08157954652677
We were able, at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago, to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republics.	55.45974403822258
I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them.	23.88243253824736
I can send the honourable Member, if he would like, a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics.	57.90283603880202
Obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side.	57.87680545063175
But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia.	47.50985287750468
I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well.	21.01221692276124
He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise, had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible.	55.66985199570606
So the honourable Member's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made.	60.86180861536065
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact.	52.999440798966795
Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation.	84.96000646131812
Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land.	95.47032624719284
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to.	37.17607598813165
We also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has applauded the Commissioner' s answer.	40.648057460293565
This is not the usual state of affairs.	20.273382423674583
And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time.	81.80808112335784
Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your interventions today.	19.951850493474083
Question No 35 by (H-0778/99):	11.284154086949753
Subject: Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment, Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies.	131.67851563591537
The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ?employability? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with.	71.70535025514768
The report also comments that in Greece there are no plans for medium to long-term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges, or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment policies, and, in addition, that there are no exact employment figures.	120.40822357276332
Could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long-term unemployment, and what these commitments are? Has the government legislated for and put into place a suitable system for pinpointing, recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment, or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work?	90.69658655737724
As far as Mr Papayannakis' question is concerned, in the 1999 Action Plan for Employment, the Commission proposed certain recommendations for Greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment.	44.126615293239254
The most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services, where problems exist, improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment.	110.9222386295528
The Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy: "Yes to Work" and "Back to Work" .	136.81160736783508
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved.	87.19369463274384
The Greek Government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed, firstly, to restructuring public sector employment services in Greece, secondly, to setting up efficient employment promotion centres - this programme has already started but has not yet been completed - and, thirdly, to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable IT systems to monitor all these policies.	152.32366809859096
In the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006, which is being financed from the Social Fund, both the resources and the policies should be used, with the Commission' s support, to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier.	62.5633973887311
The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made.	33.190724691544716
Thank you, Commissioner for your reply.	11.527330085763325
However, our current situation is as follows: at 11.3%, we have the second highest unemployment in Europe, which was not previously the case, we have the biggest increase in unemployment, we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed, i.e. less than 1% of GDP, while other countries, such as France, Belgium and Germany spend 3-4%, and it is not clear how the money received from the Social Fund has been used, inter alia, to combat unemployment.	66.86733812168761
You tell me that you, as the Commission, have made recommendations.	72.27787422139261
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to.	37.77736268600535
However, my question for a very long time has been this: what happened with previous policies?	81.45996522002379
Did anyone find work?	1042.9028418099044
How many people found work?	174.1848600535659
If you cannot tell us for this year, then last year and the year before.	64.73301804702517
What has been done about training?	48.58275316334323
Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees?	47.33721181103209
Do we have any figures?	49.808598401544046
In other words, do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece?	71.21015897105111
Mr Papayannakis, the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned, and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies.	68.37185619528812
Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and, as far as I can see, an increase in productivity.	39.755229952580216
The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines.	46.55591832551379
As you know, there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated.	40.2158930162837
They concern access to training, the ratio of men to women with access to training, and special action for the long-term unemployed.	96.97538356142508
The Commission will endeavour, for all these specific guidelines, to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006.	40.67672459679374
Question No 36 by (H-0782/99):	9.12758228813227
Subject: Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy?	73.52696756472344
The Danish pension scheme, the Efterløn, only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to retire.	99.96358266892099
Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire.	22.692317781381693
The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law.	91.13552626374602
It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are, however, still pending before the Council.	41.034812649349206
There is, as yet, no European Court case law on Efterløn, but it could validly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality.	158.11302831136948
The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach.	57.9027532081899
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark.	63.56235598484469
I noticed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the Commission, but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been.	29.849127077597075
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission.	15.707753496684171
The Commissioner also more than hinted, of course, that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-Danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions, due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system.	63.29338967823231
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter, for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate.	38.75248383950043
So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question.	17.667979457627148
Honourable Member, I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law.	64.08987701320598
This is one such case and discussions are under way between the Danish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter, to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who, as things stand, have a right to this pension.	64.07850953968173
Briefly, just to follow on from that last point, I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission's objections, such as they are, would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme, but simply that the Commission has a concern, which it has the right to have under Community law, to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify.	74.55351864966683
I think that the answer is brief and clear.	42.488025300543924
Of course it is as you say.	45.670676156005825
There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark, that is not where the problem lies.	108.79605336109536
The problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals residing outside Denmark.	299.0244324145921
Question No 37 by (H-0791/99):	9.756717370979873
Subject: Working time directive Can the Commission say what action it proposes taking to ensure a level of protection, equivalent to that provided by the 1993 working time directive, for non-consultant hospital doctors, who were excluded from that directive and again from the proposal for a Council amending directive (COM(98)0662-C4-0715/98 - 98/0318(SYN))?	110.94387350379532
A proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors.	31.60440226136563
The content of the proposal concerns the average 48-hour working week of doctors, with the possibility, following negotiation, of increasing it to 54 hours.	164.9061037258081
The Council, Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive.	66.21833585645648
Parliament has proposed 4 years, the Commission 7 and the Council 13.	235.31894142434282
This proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure.	16.12184539372779
Although there is this disagreement, I should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of working doctors throughout Europe.	73.1245975941773
Question No 38 by (H-0805/99):	9.853082377898764
Subject: Measures to advance gender equality One of the working groups of Commissioners announced by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality (gender mainstreaming).	228.78771638200533
Which Commissioners are members of this group?	125.10812123137691
How many meetings of the group have been held to date?	54.89493917444774
What concrete measures have been discussed?	46.516175829380906
This question covers several individual matters.	105.65707291735939
It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality.	115.06895518699204
The Commissioners taking part are President Prodi, Vice-President Kinnock, Mr Reding and myself.	280.4322141755004
The meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000.	46.96351184242139
Three serious issues were discussed: the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women, of which I gave an initial evaluation, the second issue was the report by Mr Busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science, and the third involved Mr Kinnock, who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the Community.	80.08878210126701
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your reply, although I regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet, since this matter is of the greatest importance.	33.15144266683224
We trusted this Commission, from the outset, to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women.	51.829842778276046
I hope that, in the future, things will change and meetings will become frequent, because there are many issues which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude, as quickly as possible, those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women.	47.21525389958409
Mrs Avilés-Perea, that was an exhortation rather than a question.	34.11521365374631
But if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions ...	58.91156416302001
Allow me to say just one word. I agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least, once it did, important decisions were taken straight away.	76.5671508144775
Question No 39 by (H-0807/99):	9.540001482892592
Subject: Community EQUAL initiative On 13 October 1999, the Commission adopted the Community's EQUAL initiative, the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers.	74.30777712124505
Under this umbrella, each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country.	57.43062172086068
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States' programmes?	112.49496857388972
Which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly?	134.6719159005868
The European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro. As the EQUAL initiative is a joint funding venture with the Member States, what will Greece's contribution amount to?	127.24254714929147
The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people.	50.30998630547838
Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace.	34.73685601131931
The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin, where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action.	64.49002637305732
This is an important aspect of this initiative.	10.571567914386357
The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation. This is the same as the Social Fund regulation, i.e. EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation.	54.652380624476464
It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament' s opinion next month.	50.99676597584451
I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy.	72.49273618372966
The Member States, i.e. the national governments, have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies, submitting proposals, selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control.	105.75324402391244
Within the European Commission, the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation, while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control, the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors.	36.63111542353462
The last question concerns the amount granted.	111.17757654424253
Greece has been granted ECU 98 million. The contribution commitment is 80%, rising to an 85% contribution from the initiative for the island regions, especially the remote Greek islands, and a contribution by Greece of 15%.	232.00208282841984
Mr President, I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQUAL initiative, especially the four actions described in it, will result both in complicated bureaucracy and, paradoxically, a non-transparent structure.	90.80966271208216
For example, one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity, as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines.	159.3051085671669
At the same time, the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation, the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures, as these are the only structures which can meet such demands.	92.28436069193097
However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas. However, at the same time, participation by those actually discriminated against, such as asylum seekers, immigrants and so on, is rendered impossible or merely symbolic.	85.66915640401882
Finally, if you consider the overall amount, which is on the small side, - EUR 2.8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objectives are, I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing.	84.11153268552437
First let me say that it would be a great help to us, now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by Parliament, if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account.	41.58859121650443
Secondly, I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment, it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment, or to support an increase in employment.	32.60273626154344
That is the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund, which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal, especially for countries like Greece.	67.6675834476632
The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission. To encourage, to assist promotion, to create statistics, to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination.	131.99957088665494
So what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups, between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences; that is mainly what we are looking for, and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be emulated.	69.19083291350849
This is the philosophy behind the initiative; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies, non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible, so that it can get as close to the people as possible.	45.62487932472712
Question No 40 by (H-0808/99):	15.084023840292
Subject: Article 13 TEU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations (Art. 4.2).	167.36391834264919
Could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstances and the groups within Article 13 (TEU) likely to be effected by such an exemption?	84.5494797102655
A month ago, the Commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment, as prescribed in the Treaty, in order to implement Article 13.	45.25719745263965
The ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted.	90.35066244508552
At the Commission' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies, Member States and the European Parliament, a number of exceptions have been made.	50.94466878727837
These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification.	74.54203692007502
Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this.	33.790235854882816
In a religious school, it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs.	73.93676926046527
That is the sort of exemption we are talking about.	28.007867067088466
Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification.	79.71813683572147
This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination.	49.74624466215599
For instance, religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example: we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian.	94.6140174584429
Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression.	33.720637439339306
Surely what we should be doing, and I hope you will agree, Commissioner, is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability, and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice, no matter how sincerely held.	90.54297192283724
I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason, be it the reason which you mentioned, sexual orientation, ethnic discrimination or any other reason.	103.68652906196374
It allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question.	102.50752579380105
In other words, it is positive discrimination.	33.20088690542153
In the example which you mentioned, it is only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic.	61.23263446103211
That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable.	38.02189340579355
Question No 41 by (H-0813/99):	9.211256981490802
Subject: Promoting jobs for women in severely less-favoured regions Given the enormous difficulties in obtaining work which women face in certain severely less-favoured regions, and given that these women very seldom have any resources to draw on, in terms of either finance, entrepreneurial or cooperative traditions or even training facilities, living as they do in rural districts where 80% of the population is on the poverty line, what measures or actions are planned to help these women overcome the hurdle of their social environment?	134.95212705841521
Does the Commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these women, or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies?	140.65311641076124
Obviously, the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds, the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy.	69.94016794494311
I should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget.	102.88581543778984
The aim of these regional policies, which, of course, are implemented under the jointly agreed European guidelines in each Member State, i.e. each Member State is responsible for implementing this programme, is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women.	74.42415831642762
I should point out that 70% of funding for the period 2000-2006, i.e. EUR 195 billion, will go to the less-favoured regions of Europe.	29.775014590163373
With particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created, I would like to say, first, that there is, via the Social Fund, an entire equal opportunities pillar which the Member States must implement, i.e. special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources.	103.8719027685209
Secondly, the LEADER initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism, with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions.	79.9272135760958
Commissioner, thank you for giving me a well-intentioned answer, which has been rigorous and well-argued.	88.53453620140273
However, I can assure you that we do not, with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less-favoured regions.	29.392399267220807
They are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation, where almost none exists.	80.95239726200775
Therefore, my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on microcredits, which have brought results in cooperation, could be applied to those women in severely less-favoured regions, who have the odds stacked against them.	68.54656623040005
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to.	29.530275667615285
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need.	34.21712630377567
With these forecasts of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the forecasts of LEADER and rural development, we will not promote, as we should, employment amongst women in the severely less-favoured regions.	45.174706443799515
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies.	28.89711133383838
Question No 42 by (H-0817/99):	7.750195339122692
Subject: Commission's plans for presentation of a new social action programme It is important that the Commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme, setting out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the 'social dialogue'.	64.7941019895432
Can the Commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme?	75.96706220296258
We estimate that the Commission' s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer.	30.06123263062169
In order to complete the programme and be able to present it, we first need to complete our consultations with Parliament, the social partners and non-governmental organisations.	59.727539086118355
These discussions have already started, but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon.	32.16930034436106
The Lisbon European Council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society, economic policy and reforms.	46.33128046805344
These results will be most important in shaping the Commission' s social programme.	67.33438453436985
I have already told the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in April between Parliament and the Commission, after the Lisbon conference, so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000-2006 can finally be drafted.	58.75905801563225
Clearly, any future social action programme should take account of developments, for example within information technology, and, in time, become a modern social action programme.	147.08198639686466
But can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter I raise in my question, namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission is planning, as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry?	46.85436759913069
We need to see which concrete alternatives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements.	107.42778427671469
Firstly, I agree with you entirely. Account will be taken of the information society; that was something which I too mentioned.	68.0773117731636
Social exclusion, the programme for women, the efforts we are making in the social protection area, everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society.	60.80550458063753
Secondly, there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented.	55.808565250476875
Where I cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which, as you know, is not included in the articles of the Treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the Treaty.	50.10323749201865
Question No 44 by (H-0819/99):	8.659709303199826
Subject: Opportunities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the EU Under Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, it should be possible for all EU citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Union.	49.57922246744479
However, for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance, freedom of movement is still highly restricted.	130.1562059569951
What measures is the Commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area?	68.05663675186238
On 26 November 1999, the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination.	38.02988968746997
As far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned, there is a directive which concentrates on combating discrimination, especially in the workplace.	61.28299250112358
The European Commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and, in the end, to promote the freedom of movement of these persons.	51.66424956876147
Of course, it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport, services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement.	49.49724347960821
The European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses, coaches and other vehicles, so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them.	75.02357737989391
In addition, you should know that, on 4 June 1998, the Council approved the recommendation for a pan-European type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs, the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout Europe.	64.72524000304234
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer.	14.779482883033973
My question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in Europe.	49.917530676996265
It is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from Gothenburg to somewhere else in Europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a wheelchair and also need to have a personal assistant or carer with you in order to manage.	63.35649865762769
I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan.	10.653028838735718
It is of course a prerequisite, however, that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability.	64.47406845372828
It would be interesting to hear whether the Commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have disabilities, so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them.	72.2428664895519
I referred to the directive which the Commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport, so that people with special needs can use them.	88.20800374600488
It has not yet been passed by the Council; it is at the consultation stage.	27.971804575706148
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level.	29.670942206570558
I think it is exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programmes for personal transport.	47.40060293323001
That is dealt with either under special programmes in education, for young people, for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy.	95.4585818294726
Question No 45 by (H-0006/00):	6.5648918908374725
Subject: Compliance with Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers The posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in Denmark, even though the deadline has passed.	90.04203038106286
The draft legislation before the Folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements.	113.34360161317457
Pursuant to Article 3(8) of the Directive, terms and conditions of employment must be in keeping with the 'collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers' and labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory'.	80.81023853387418
However, such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis.	98.97702311592552
There are therefore two possible solutions: either the Directive is inapplicable in Denmark, or Denmark is required by the Directive to introduce universally applicable agreements.	100.85320639382387
Can the Commission confirm that the Directive concerning the posting of workers is inapplicable in Denmark as far as 'collective agreements ... declared universally applicable' (cf. Article 3(1)) are concerned, given that such universally applicable agreements do not exist under Danish law?	79.99515849613154
If not, will it explain how the Directive is to be complied with in this area?	38.0119955769404
The European Union posting of workers directive stipulates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country.	76.74728396336846
What it says it that one of two things may apply, i.e. either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector.	90.62050288325977
Because Denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules, provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that, apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation, the hours in universally applicable collective agreements, concluded by the most representative organisations, also apply to posted workers.	149.90977415456186
In other words, to put it simply, Denmark has a choice: it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it.	150.6831303241158
Discussions are being held between the European Commission and Denmark, and Denmark is expected to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation.	55.69643033778602
The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission' s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply.	55.35152993788063
We are waiting to see what the next move will be.	63.65313526567056
Thank you for a very clear answer, the gist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements.	57.87619830196476
It is a very clear answer, but it is also an answer, may I point out, which puts Danish organisations, the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament in a very, very difficult situation politically, for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the Danish model, which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements, and the Continental model, which presupposes legislation.	82.4704708343284
The disagreement and the correspondence to which you refer, Commissioner, concern, first and foremost, another directive, namely the working time directive, but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further Treaty infringement proceedings looming because the Danish Government does not intend, or has expressly stated that it does not wish, to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements.	165.49872478030392
Firstly, no attempt is being made to change the system in Denmark or in any other country.	77.234378337255
As I said earlier, there are always problems interpreting the directives of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another.	65.0700040958797
As far as your question is concerned, this problem does not only apply to Denmark. It is not only Denmark which has matters pending.	59.72699796267954
Five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage.	96.66578355146615
What now needs to be done, and this was the reason for the consultations and discussions between the Commission and the Danish Government, and with other governments, is to find the best way forward, so that something which is decided at European level by all the Member States, and which constitutes a general framework, can also include workers posted to Denmark from other countries.	54.88920694140561
And this is the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine governments to move.	77.20076148915946
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your dedication.	7.889190912688113
You have fulfilled your objective for today, which is to answer all the questions.	90.58499021812574
We congratulate you.	158.58010516207307
Since the time allocated to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 46 to 68 will be replied to in writing.	56.36027167068994
That concludes Question Time.	95.12773847518423
(The sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	7.100483483784511
1997 discharge	881.9921628578376
The next item is the report (A5-0004/2000) by Mrs van der Laan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1997 financial year (Section I - Parliament, II - Council, III - Commission, IV - Court of Justice and V - Court of Auditors) [SEC(1998) 520 - C4-0350/1998, SEC(1998) 522 - C4-0351/1998, SEC(1998) 519 - C4-0352/1999]	26.99377101721094
The Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, is not here yet, but I hope, and expect, that she will arrive in the next few minutes.	50.8213041394398
Nevertheless, I recommend that we start, in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate, and particularly the rapporteur' s speech, from her office, if that is where she still is.	62.887829385839744
Mr President, I am sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise.	54.31068234289466
I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report, it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation.	33.66409396835418
Mr President, early last year, the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future.	59.20697931117819
In its resolution, this Parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious, far-reaching proposals for reform from the new European Commission.	90.22821870727107
This report, therefore, appears at a crucial time, on the eve of Mr Kinnock' s reforms.	56.06082615253132
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans.	31.958134709260566
In the period leading up to this, it already appeared, on the basis of the initial drafts, that the Commission had made very important pledges.	49.00084764768313
We asked for a whistle-blower' s regulation, and this is now in place.	49.84868176759939
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated.	194.05085984404525
This has now been done.	21.866815984642454
Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets.	77.16811597937443
This is in place too.	29.875512802260157
Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges.	39.076085445971394
It did this as well.	58.757545035990226
The Commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with Parliament in terms of SEM 2000.	30.156771812889705
Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices.	113.65474087578234
These are sound, first steps which illustrate that, if this Parliament so wishes, changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly.	112.74349686249246
We want more than that, however.	72.05839180067838
The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme.	49.595182856347364
This is not only necessary for proper public administration, it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the European citizen.	44.683068125934234
We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points.	59.055679576736516
Firstly, Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents.	161.62787594323535
This, however, presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents.	61.458780743409214
In the context of providing information, I would like to draw the Commission' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents.	24.989316674050475
If the current draft is correct, then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today.	55.75451667299353
We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not.	65.28046394870653
Neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents.	112.77774736781355
We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful.	52.53575413603297
Furthermore, it should be the case that, if the Court of Auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running, the management should be held responsible for it, and this will have an effect on chances of promotion.	48.22940672760481
Ultimately, we also need to achieve better cooperation, of course, between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts.	51.85714701697255
This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year.	39.91499552231944
It should no longer be the case that, although Europe is an economic power, we have no political influence because, when the chips are down, we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desperately need it.	66.02169287319545
I would quote Gaza as an example.	26.724293100098148
It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that, as yet, it has been left unused.	36.20461758870606
Mr President, since 1996, the discharge has acquired a heavy, political significance.	65.32664332245048
It is one of the most powerful weapons Parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care.	59.07364835311466
This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow.	67.0383635060106
However, we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place.	50.464945844090785
Indeed, the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the Court of Auditors have been cleared up.	50.59170316822152
Finally, this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission. But this does not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order.	28.524111041232572
As long as we have no status, we are not credible as a force for reforming the Union. The reforms of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe' s development process.	36.56805248679872
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic.	67.96246155655696
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe.	82.05534284381477
Mr President, the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so.	39.73262095628978
We went ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on, that is, by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers' money in Europe.	77.52594390319291
During the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget.	53.249819824441616
They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them.	115.74836765631525
The first is a tendency for the Commission to embark on very ambitious programmes, particularly in third countries, without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper resourcing.	48.306924784152336
The second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the Commission, in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts.	71.32869482525524
I know that all the Institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resources.	31.401398985573824
That cannot excuse everything that we came across.	93.1936782708368
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so.	37.430321367703456
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock.	27.72015503365831
From what I have seen of the reform process, it looks good.	63.130082014160195
I saw some of Mr Kinnock's papers today, I heard some of what he had to say.	45.348704045450795
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need.	106.68757556759867
But we need that reform process.	59.94589707604479
Many of the general points raised in our committee's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan's report.	28.470782433157165
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it.	30.21638488509547
It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports, a series of details.	91.92256176750966
It groups them together and that is very important.	134.36332406465135
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to.	14.822181252970278
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe.	106.18927570461841
We have to get this right.	29.403459488895578
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly.	36.31635637143272
We have to remedy that.	34.6112235330944
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms.	58.988865697591045
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending.	67.70909078657088
We need proper information, given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past.	40.193252025600906
It has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible.	32.25517032182902
I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and, at the same time, that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue.	37.798002958907325
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored.	42.79198230391035
Mr President, I am sure the Commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which, as you are all so very well aware, led to the forced resignation of the Santer Commission.	48.395031517414594
The Socialist Group will be voting to grant discharge.	47.623021893094545
I am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well.	22.19565238019206
But that is not to say that we are satisfied, and that everything in the garden is rosy.	22.910457502139366
It is clear that a radical overhaul of the Commission is long overdue.	25.338055462463878
It indicates, however, that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction.	25.82105963702528
I just want to outline some of the issues that we, as Socialists, have put down as amendments.	46.09693271290622
We hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform.	58.19519080555538
First of all, the immunity of officials: this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor.	66.79340621421629
We need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption.	27.42273787027048
It is critical to note that the Commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the Court of Auditors.	20.189139968608387
The Court's report is there for a reason, our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through.	47.63168594580516
I have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the Commission.	19.862980961590758
Even if we hear nothing else, we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see.	26.94590528728124
Too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them.	57.91026366535882
We want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future.	43.123758526375
The other issue is access to confidential documents.	88.07569550581938
We have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had.	41.66232861997248
We understand that we also have a responsibility here, that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential.	85.63419573655256
We have put down an amendment to that effect.	45.90285690650985
One issue which is referred to in the van der Laan report is the whole question of the Gaza hospital.	49.016878951052455
The situation there is totally unacceptable.	35.93226770195409
We will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue.	53.03977778099858
I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan.	13.331610685701856
I do not usually bother congratulating people but I think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks.	69.23202013205601
Mr President, Commissioner, if we are honest, we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation.	38.1721903165718
We are discussing last year' s discharge, but also the Commission' s responsibility.	38.63592078720104
I would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks.	30.16934963091104
The assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed.	81.86290731863596
It is about a Commission which is no more.	45.77218472223425
There is now a new Commission.	29.558634596111705
Then it is logical to grant discharge, because how can the current Commissioner be blamed where 1997 is concerned?	83.09415206205665
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts.	90.54798027474725
We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission' s good intentions, but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions.	52.251981527764194
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month.	121.92769109356435
We are all very much anticipating this, but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge.	41.330058423741484
It is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled.	24.910890814378895
This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed.	65.89497528369085
Take, for example, the pledges made by the Commission. They look good in themselves.	80.94463881049215
I have read a few documents written by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them.	47.80309869436881
But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome: the public nature and confidentiality of documents.	53.92655220104265
The previous speaker already said something about this.	64.1100195043344
A document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level, but at a high level within the Commission - which, instead of enhancing the public nature of documents, is having the opposite effect.	56.3553269480059
This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results.	43.11924518177798
This also applies to whistle-blowers.	16.745152226593333
Mr Kinnock has also devoted some fine-sounding phrases to this subject but, at the same time, it is entirely unclear, at this moment when we have to make a decision, what, for example, happens with whistle-blowers who want to get something off their chest and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament.	75.44909532361784
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type.	47.25056903254947
So there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made.	81.3011740664374
This also applies, for example, to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced.	45.77183550951059
In my opinion, the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management, but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general, empty proposals.	66.20747482235609
At the moment, our group still feels sympathy for, and patience with, the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past, but this patience has a limit.	47.15886754318418
Clear progress must be visible.	126.05701377562471
At present, we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals, but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so.	41.104422253366195
Finally, Mr President, the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission.	42.424102896699274
I express the hope that - in fact, I urge the present Commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission. Otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value.	48.97148610883306
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge, the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned, in this case in the course of 1997.	78.89909712832804
In our Group, we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996.	81.80258102051513
In that year, we voted against granting discharge.	96.44400433868248
As a result, we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997, too.	61.42690426943518
We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors.	21.09633746047576
It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised.	65.67689695218304
So far, the promises which have been made are still, however, to be fulfilled, especially where transparency is concerned.	80.73859832447128
We are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution, but against the granting of discharge.	38.73348323402743
Mr President, first of all, I have only positive comments to make on Mrs Van der Laan' s very expert work on this report.	25.418710933141206
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997.	61.44363149652433
The report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts.	88.81792414315154
We support these critical remarks, and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd, against this background, to vote in favour of approving the accounts.	76.36777382745169
It has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an auditor' s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful, and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we, as Members of this Parliament, were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned.	59.366733980456914
The majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new Commission' s implementing a series of reforms, so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous Commission' s period of office is not repeated.	69.4016472324919
Again, I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission' s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission' s accountability for the future.	40.00336804351523
We do not think that the new Commission, under any circumstances, could incur liability for the past.	41.957157427107695
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission' s liability as an institution.	24.739961228500533
The mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time, and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better.	93.43876563458359
By means of this extraordinary procedure, Parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squarely where it belongs, namely with the previous Commission.	115.8717900414017
It was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous Commission, and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating.	58.39185097569942
There is no reason why, against this background, we should agree to grant discharge.	42.739869576641645
As far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned, we shall abstain from voting, and where, finally, the motion for a resolution is concerned, we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it.	69.77248502130912
Mr President, the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission, to whom it was to be granted, had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity.	104.15048559344348
Mrs van der Laan' s report - on which she has lavished a great deal of hard work, and for which we are indebted to her - proposes that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997.	38.26223202697231
One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor' s budgetary management - Mr Camre just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year, 1996, was denied.	99.04415847603177
That is just the way things are, however.	89.58716644615153
In taking over the mandate, the new Commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made.	62.73636653266316
Since, on account of the college system, discharge can only be granted to the Commission as a whole or, alternatively, denied or postponed, it is no longer of any consequence that four former Commissioners who belonged to the previous Commission that has yet to be discharged, crop up again as Members of this body.	86.10675502422494
This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed.	43.852221396077894
If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control' s proposal this week and grants discharge, then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque.	44.628322557494705
For it is the third section of Mrs van der Laan' s report that is the most important, to my mind, namely the motion for a resolution.	31.558765143619397
The comments contained within, under eight headings, are an integral part of the discharge, the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision.	96.75584674590085
In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - Parliament will have to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether or not it was too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for 1997.	49.85021493706849
We will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission presents its reform programme.	32.760490840898335
We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency, transparency and accountability, and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information, are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority.	126.72568669969708
Mr President, we all recall that Parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform.	80.88483492577788
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures.	114.43264763737388
It is fair to say that the new President, Mr Prodi, and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament.	40.30030985215879
However, the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives.	25.175818757665937
Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure, for example, that the enlargement process can succeed.	97.54652251308245
I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analysed in this debate.	65.6530062863978
But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that, as the European Commission is reformed, it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission.	34.95637971266492
Mr President, the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997, but in reality it does not deserve it.	39.73899679345261
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and, therefore, the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability.	44.06880039458175
It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission' s remit. The new Commission has, on the other hand, undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals, and I must admit that I am not impressed at all.	41.79245601397623
The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one' s friends unfortunately still exists.	318.2275961910915
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start. I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly.	74.16349365748319
I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO.	158.03946072453513
I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter.	33.5347849144474
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information.	35.065369576313
From the outside, it looks as if the Commission has something to hide.	76.06366030862448
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case.	59.19557464626814
The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission.	36.816208485520605
It was this practice which led to the Commission' s downfall.	30.02160289935066
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents. Otherwise, we cannot carry out our work.	76.7039300043532
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.	11.40811540516848
The debate is closed.	3.77548916318001
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	3.2691741867479744
Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts	148.5257243343883
The next item is the report (A5-0001/2000) by Mr van Hulten, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on action to be taken on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on reform of the Commission.	7.832663678016504
Mr President, this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud, nepotism and corruption in the European Commission.	40.14463906318869
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that: "It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility".	79.77962686389417
Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team.	78.45240102442006
The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal.	105.90210857622287
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition; a new, reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office.	103.51757662446792
Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform, which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today.	56.207830067264524
The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function.	35.50319722317627
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted.	77.09680029711791
In a symbolic but significant gesture Commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol, tobacco, petrol and consumer goods.	106.95856137096253
New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials.	91.67423832414676
The number of departments has been reduced.	37.134317074611786
The Commission, in my opinion, has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated.	31.340770587124723
The overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong, honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels; an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential.	76.02482507772358
In order to achieve this, action is required in four areas.	22.078167700759593
First, financial management and control within the Commission must be improved.	50.10780089713166
One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control.	26.23828967480669
The Commission's DGs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure, including financial control.	26.00303551104449
A new independent audit system service must be set up.	47.08953461157246
DGs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities.	122.860838725317
In return for this greater degree of autonomy, managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions.	89.7009980420201
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time.	27.368681983573897
Changes to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes.	85.76909347903411
But while the Commission must ensure that it respects the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase, this must not be an excuse for inertia.	40.097595350616395
Urgent change is required today.	188.24123481705828
Second, the fight against fraud, mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened, firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive.	61.26476068067822
This requires a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly, by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud.	68.49105596996495
OLAF, the Commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent European public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal courts, criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the Union by Members and officials of the European institutions.	85.88126788831157
A proposal can be made, a proposal should be made, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, by the middle of this year.	21.665947056158824
Third, standards in European public life must be upheld.	137.50486862285587
The political crisis which led to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct.	43.42230310634716
A number of codes have since been introduced.	37.556819354232324
They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding.	34.09305651758272
The European institutions should follow the example of a number of countries, most notably the United Kingdom, and institute a committee for standards in public life, with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the European institutions.	68.36536865701592
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected.	110.07824436332112
At the end of last year Mr Kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers.	39.97146813977939
They must be implemented without delay.	40.505575004226216
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.	84.61982063996636
Crucially, reforms must not be limited to the Commission.	26.035982477646083
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules, administrative procedures and management practices.	143.3194377939044
Finally, the Commission's human resource policy must be modernised.	29.38259013269027
It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern, multinational organisation.	24.691911854138283
The social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue.	75.43488577362879
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive.	43.925426901104785
Too many young, new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years.	176.5175719538065
Merit must be recognised and rewarded, specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade.	100.28121045444712
The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent.	31.283212673465886
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed.	124.87335599992728
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions.	93.52546545495976
It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders, or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States.	82.53302126936542
Commissioner Kinnock will, tomorrow, present his communication on reform.	178.98817738915423
This communication must contain a clear timetable.	46.774083804026084
With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be.	138.87909904229343
Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away.	58.33232429635949
Now is the time for Europe to put its own house in order; to instil in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility.	52.28374622124267
In June of last year Europe's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism.	75.04454389030711
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories.	21.29488009931199
Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism.	29.45984851057659
Mr President, I do not want to be misunderstood - I sincerely hope this does not happen - and I should therefore like to start by saying that I am, of course, in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate, necessary reforms.	25.989108725419843
This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis, but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points, in order to make people more aware, if possible, of what we are talking about.	43.202916426903194
All the experts can provide information and news, formulate opinions and give advice, but, they have no political or elective responsibility, and rightly so.	123.39311651953017
I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which, on some occasions, I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive.	58.84988006255863
I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few ideas - that Parliament alone, and no one else, can exert an influence over its Members. If this were not the case, the European Parliament' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years, and this institution would not move forward, as it should.	63.74255483326959
It is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation.	54.95294952630904
Members of Parliament must possess the qualities of morality, discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately, and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else.	68.4769487002467
I would point out that there is no European legal system, but that a different legal system exists in each Member State.	22.433752124408933
We run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways.	46.83599498659736
I agree that an investigation system should be introduced, but I am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and, in any case, the equal need for the right to a defence.	43.9089565303927
I am opposed to European Community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat: whistle-blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium.	70.3987273902259
In conclusion, Mr President, Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy: we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers, not go into reverse.	95.98013792992757
This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957.	45.677765274397316
The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself, are now part of European folklore.	37.10911968115531
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated.	62.93084581316724
Remember that the Council of Ministers, absent again this evening from our debate, approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March.	102.33449229468714
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September.	36.217964893914555
Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored.	27.84603743454552
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials.	82.50610696779988
Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months, which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency.	58.58037607311246
We are therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly.	58.635598285951026
While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly, it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode.	77.1197803582189
Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information.	85.66531656778935
This was, after all, one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission.	38.11608776622582
Have the lessons not been learnt?	167.0366378582325
The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee.	53.78397586357602
We could, in no way, agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package.	45.187762163078496
The less precise, Mr van Hulten, we are in our resolutions, the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like.	97.18160825884355
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men' s report should be implemented.	35.407709495279676
We have, as the EPP-ED group, submitted all the recommendations of the Wise Men' s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report, entirely changing the nature of the van Hulten report in committee.	43.39462885238337
We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee, in particular, our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you, Commissioner, accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct, particularly when considering appointments and promotion.	91.96557110947984
Looking to the future, we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission.	35.94354353780379
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals.	65.12814511695633
Commissioner, you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occurred.	98.62627243349985
In a nutshell: there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available.	175.431596382928
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible.	41.51630076690304
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget.	49.973533726211016
We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions.	89.02012915993645
But, equally, we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination.	97.70642836070456
Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform.	69.40505592447566
Mr President, I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation.	31.428085348701178
Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report.	20.67622125317839
It is an excellent report.	12.670852239546456
It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues.	57.387889556518566
It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van Hulten has produced.	32.434766276576696
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse.	46.415595706393546
Yes, a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet, and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow.	78.59468416852471
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far.	17.463490223107918
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change.	45.82102433725665
Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility.	53.99505969431828
It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission.	30.553613080414777
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation.	14.62763210185141
That is important.	36.31700576429505
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another.	54.240907942397094
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible.	84.78816615248279
We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal.	48.48222394328917
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission.	42.65305772023949
We cannot continue with a situation where incompetence, mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service.	68.52215447262508
I will give you one example of this.	24.60347111192726
In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million.	100.01793708073777
It is clear that is not acceptable.	14.887769928959536
What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation?	37.245017838160855
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit.	56.40853235729549
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working.	61.88775505323407
But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated.	29.192299054072713
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because, unlike what Mr Elles has just said, the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March.	65.27470549478154
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones.	24.570280654080324
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history.	69.13875695237653
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves.	36.52647144849136
Our own staff policy is outdated.	90.30169085869716
Some of our working practices need radical reform.	93.89617007263361
I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process.	13.487424931913425
We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting.	60.66970207164001
We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities.	88.44411232874171
Finally, can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public.	29.76191287336798
European taxpayers need to be re-assured.	38.296219030896
The fate of the Commission, of the whole European Union, rests on delivery of this reform.	40.996039553173865
That is the key issue, delivery of these proposals.	24.673780634784695
Mr President, I would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, on his first report.	14.391354516642924
I very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments.	40.38342112315476
I think that the report drawn up by the Wise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament - as already stated by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run.	55.794303256783934
We have submitted an amendment to this effect.	21.17571518209437
From the many points made by Mr van Hulten in his report, I would like to highlight a few, not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly.	41.45634087057088
Firstly, I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents.	24.95889025457364
The Commission' s records leave a great deal to be desired.	24.613321970911564
We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair, which, as it happens, has still not been sorted out.	47.804933670232366
Curiously, very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets, even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General, and this is clearly something which should not happen.	68.2338599455151
If Parliament want to carry out proper inspections, these documents must be available, and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to improve this situation.	30.828170183520506
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control.	21.44138377740759
This has also been partly dealt with in the van Hulten report. I think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented.	53.81565824622764
The general impression at present is that anything budget-related within Europe is bad.	211.9931645306119
It is clear that, over the past couple of years, we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure.	30.179917900771525
Is this possible?	100.20181652153256
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out.	20.659620114815336
If we admit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first.	59.51709942843728
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten.	6.8453628538892355
It is his first report here in plenary.	62.68801257191918
This is worth a compliment although I regret, of course, that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue.	48.047872922762146
It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late.	47.44793330553255
In my opinion, this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control.	26.540667486292897
Let us be honest.	46.969659383339895
The second report of the Wise Men arrived in September.	35.03750762588145
We are now four months down the line.	116.71305698971092
Meanwhile, Mr van Hulten has been inundated with amendments, more than 100 amendments in the first round.	43.64295992198393
He went back to work, rewrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions, but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round.	94.59498064162447
My fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed, too extensive and too late.	51.36896639860161
Moreover, I have been informed that the Commission has approved a report - today of all days - on the reform of the Commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our Parliament, I hope.	45.12822340196049
Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening?	54.97546303631477
Mr van Hulten, my Group of the Greens and regionalists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon' s plenary meeting to embellish this report.	86.12248201912189
After all, it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report.	86.53185725428423
So tomorrow, if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs, this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable.	114.48367797778428
In any case, it should be clear that my group, of course, fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men.	21.521131042979704
In any event, I look forward to the document which was approved by the Commission today.	17.462911489444647
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February.	20.900607647150483
I have to inform you, Commissioner, that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauges for our group, gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not.	42.94848700743446
I would like to end on the following point. Just as the White Paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated, we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission.	39.14761744002548
I think that there is a need for this, as public opinion is looking for change and, in any event, my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002.	31.853303890580023
Mr President, this report is positive but, actually, we need more than this.	43.434013570534574
Fraud, mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere.	58.554068813260116
They are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow.	102.74192569548227
Via the structural funds, a great deal of the European budget is being pumped around the system.	36.80042962050657
This is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States.	36.373183189818796
But there is also funding which is being pumped via Brussels back to the same rich Member States.	66.7186970673122
Districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating.	188.47062256884027
After each incident of improper use of this money, and certainly after fraud, the call for stricter control is more pronounced.	174.47505635004268
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem.	115.4546168834458
It will, at best, lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects.	63.38227365421629
It would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a European detour.	72.63654003642465
In the next couple of years, we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent regions with a low income per capita of the population.	36.720244638434295
This is probably the only way to achieve less fraud, less overheads, more transparency and more democracy.	92.20536224018906
Mr President, a year has not yet passed, but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently.	63.865163720827674
The first report was widely publicised, formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make mincemeat, first of the President of the Commission, and then of the majority of the European Commissioners, even though they had no connection with fraud, mismanagement or nepotism.	74.29307400172516
Reading now what happened then, not even a year ago, it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform, as is maintained today, so much so that this second report - which, on the other hand, could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases, since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report.	113.7506519294445
It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament, nor to the majority of the trade unions, who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration, but, in practice, are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members, putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use.	99.76220478383833
Trade union representatives sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee, thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state.	223.99505030829877
Incomprehensibly, trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition, and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF, thereby placing this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee its impartiality, at great risk.	198.73507118456803
I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time, which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates, discussions and the exchange of information.	92.15560509098106
Mr President, when it comes to putting its own house in order, the European Commission is in a Catch-22 situation.	52.63897785210516
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission.	68.26614372874113
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound, the more applause they receive.	151.9097841722642
There again, it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen, and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks.	59.2017283757154
This may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue.	54.38332115172671
Nevertheless, the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see, and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report.	28.02921679655045
Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments, it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points.	52.68962935098365
Allow me to start with the most important demand.	38.38266387232932
We do not want financial control to be abolished.	35.36419316600049
The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made, not in every case, but wherever uncertainties or risks arise.	122.73681915134985
The Commission is sending out the wrong signals here, by renaming the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audits, for example.	54.903080497550555
It may well be easy enough to change the Commission' s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts, particularly those relating to budgetary discipline.	44.28275364647718
I do not have exact figures, but the Community' s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller, to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office.	119.46020496557126
This cannot be ignored or evaded, certainly not on account of soft law, as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee.	71.92101372649498
Irrespective of such legal considerations, it would be an unforgivable mistake, under the circumstances, to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are, at long last, no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investigatory mechanisms.	87.14726527340046
As we see it, there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future: a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller, concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up, and finally, there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF, the new anti-fraud office.	79.5526121277412
It is to be welcomed that Mr van Hulten' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie, which must be tackled.	50.28681761983384
A few salient points: the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect, especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours, including those of a financial nature.	97.12763738182798
There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned, and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the Commission are rather vague.	41.77100881608253
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked.	38.68285433738941
Mr President, firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague, Mr van Hulten.	14.625205003746602
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am, I think, entitled to feel a little proud of him.	58.59789287067422
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report.	21.161119420697425
Mr President, the Commission' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy.	117.43711467522348
The call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one.	129.00342605242517
I have witnessed from close up within the Development Committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80% of the money is not spent. Sometimes, an enormous reservoir of money is created, not because it is not desperately needed, not because there are no sound proposals, but because the whole system has collapsed.	84.56165611973233
A lack of responsibility, too much ex ante, not enough ex post and, as a result, far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending.	84.92962782773343
It would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind, with all the work organised on that basis.	58.917941215731226
When the Commission' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March, I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change.	70.92469030679572
Without any doubt, this will then be a service, Mr President, to the European public and, by means of the results we produce, we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lost over the past couple of years.	66.93455322134305
This is the best support we can give to European democracy.	53.65887836431919
If, in this way, we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century, we are witnessing a very special moment indeed.	52.089311591838324
Mr President, first of all, congratulations to Michiel van Hulten for his first report.	29.783087152532094
It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion: in at the deep end and you will swim in no time.	83.55289371033382
Mr van Hulten, I think you deserve a medal for your efforts.	57.65674595423636
There are two points which, in my opinion, deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR.	30.38882365131682
Firstly, there is the Commissioners' individual responsibility.	211.76685228728687
This must be regulated during the IGC.	45.43938812215122
However, we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have, therefore, submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council.	49.62095494623515
Secondly, as already mentioned by my colleague, Mr Mulder, the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts.	31.98572126479077
This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution.	78.27602900239805
We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well.	42.29685906825965
Only when all European institutions are reformed will we have the open, democratic and decisive Europe which our citizens now finally deserve.	196.49149431421353
Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the House.	19.65981412417462
I am sure that it will serve, amongst other things, to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups.	65.2603271414638
At this stage, there can be no delay in the process of reforming the Commission, demanded by our citizens.	33.103121735261375
This Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed, even by its Presidents.	83.44077639495582
It now appears that this desire is more serious.	62.00818590235415
After the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies, it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised, on 14 September, to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February.	96.55204483267558
This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme.	69.31162574715306
The report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the Committee of Experts commissioned by this Parliament.	32.97690306468896
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway, that he preferred to get things right, but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting.	147.16371538783994
We therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and, if it is, I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process.	37.75099990487585
We want a strong Commission, which can act in an independent and neutral manner, but with political sense.	50.97934571176412
Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office.	169.8914951296418
Therefore, the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties.	53.96814807051125
Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise.	47.069756757016435
I do not know your exact view in this respect, Mr Kinnock, but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed.	52.98633883342985
We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively, and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present.	73.17922209707228
Therefore, Commissioner, we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme, and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat, but not with this Parliament, which expects profound and daring changes.	103.55514718232158
Mr President, the Santer Commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line.	87.03613486522636
Therefore, the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order.	127.0744699977802
As far as this is concerned, a number of people have already referred to the fact that the Commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow-up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis, with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future.	43.66292183679689
Naturally, this is only to be welcomed.	34.105316375859026
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price, as it were, that is, of having to dispense with independent - and I stress, independent - prior approval.	104.71154240026318
Up until now, the Commission' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa.	130.80594955179535
And so it is the "two key" principle that applies here.	127.81038399086017
A single key is to suffice in future.	80.10997997162443
The financial controller is no longer to make advance checks, if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the Commission.	67.6814917030459
If you will pardon me for saying so, Mr Kinnock, what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes.	72.60308955698717
What we really need to focus on, however, is making the checks more effective.	84.10387250105313
This could be achieved by no longer insisting, in future, that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp.	66.74494874253011
It is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all.	90.72111120652178
Therefore, in future, prior approval should take place in a targeted manner, that is, only in cases of uncertainty or risk.	83.32896846394247
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis, that is, in the operational Directorates-General, amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money, so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming.	82.44597500736788
However, the financial controllers must work independently.	57.785115433318204
That is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the Commission, when it talks in terms of decentralisation.	43.56940453207795
It is obviously the Commission' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual Directorates-General, but this is precisely what we do not want.	35.805734862987094
Surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the Leonardo affair, when the internal examiners in the relevant Directorate-General issued warnings, but these were neither heeded nor passed on.	145.69646069005347
Therefore, independence is prerequisite for effective checks.	151.45809278518126
That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribes to.	34.64002659526698
Indeed, the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence, and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well?	72.75984412083623
I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow' s vote.	47.299429845767996
Mrs Theato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard.	55.876972335461325
Mr President, a couple of years ago, the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures.	44.64780905565837
This led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions, whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise.	55.00210326200504
This was stupid of the old Commission, and Parliament was of no help on that occasion.	64.46792002059722
When I read Mr van Hulten' s passage about personnel policy, I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air.	63.35181616709079
There are too many rights, too many regulations and too little room for leadership.	98.20054979947761
There is no backbone, and no teeth.	17.588020512185125
Where is the beef?	79.96022561346138
And I would also say this to you, Commissioner: please, deliver the beef even if it is British.	51.37073004237731
Romano Prodi promised a revolution.	157.03414119956028
You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself, but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues, the ones where it hurts!	81.98029240348545
Sort out the tangle of staff allowances.	94.71282680189015
Stand firm on the demand for mobility, not as a right, as it says here in the report, but as a management tool.	110.32890374404802
Ensure too, that training becomes a management tool.	266.4392938309076
Do not listen to the report' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed.	76.29687035801064
It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis.	67.61281724382457
Finally, Mr President, as a member of the Bureau until six months ago, I would urge you to address this issue in the Bureau so that we here in Parliament at least comply, in our own administration, with the demands we are making on others.	38.48464214414356
We have not done this so far, and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing.	26.75033363422997
Mr President, I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I voted for it.	9.177728269963916
So I refer to the things I do not agree with.	23.651615139266294
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament.	16.764514358649482
This report is about the Commission.	24.17085392099277
Parliament is a separate subject.	66.7507414117293
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission.	26.54926834380846
In addition to that, there is the question of duty-free.	37.19995296975992
That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports.	74.37417223057068
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either.	27.024622631189064
Most of the report is about financial control.	34.06132981639348
That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee.	39.9619583904502
But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission.	33.57055103066128
After all, it is only 1% of GDP, by comparison with national spending.	63.50709659809055
We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80% of these resources are spent by the Member States.	39.97827309658568
So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money.	45.949601027712134
We should get it into perspective.	98.66531395613767
It is important to remember that.	17.29481329005747
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money.	56.39277251627638
They have very little of it.	55.974335097028934
They have a much wider responsibility.	59.22135118787766
That wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment, food safety, foreign trade, the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them.	84.0979373404529
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust.	21.911133494768674
If there is, we have generated it in this House in the past year.	37.54357836275048
I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.	59.91674804545144
We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted, doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs.	45.72511960328448
That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were.	58.212870004336814
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it.	43.859132817497894
While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement, for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far.	97.17456486420603
Mr President, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report.	7.57896252235725
I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work.	24.79687601427481
The process of reform has been going on for some time, and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the Commission.	45.693036206414085
The Commission' s administration simply does not function particularly well.	55.79446288579434
Naturally, there are good, capable employees in the Commission, and they are in the majority. But we need radical reform.	80.52329060204967
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy.	70.81942067814217
People should have clearly-defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable.	72.77976154530782
The Financial Regulation should be amended.	22.279495749597388
We agree that we should have better control of the finances.	32.84389022525617
It is just a question of how.	24.122627283442053
The Commission and the Committee of Independent Experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control.	23.34170356777006
We should be careful about this.	20.666324994909964
We should retain some form of ex ante financial control.	30.168436142190075
It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent.	63.80808933291269
This would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through.	61.297312957962596
Instead, we should be reforming and decentralising control.	54.85124274373637
The Commission does not have enough staff.	27.547414135833034
As Members of the European Parliament, we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the Commission' s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it.	31.7233708915709
And the Commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs.	63.234986920659445
The staffing system is too rigid.	36.304487515946434
There should be a more frequent rotation of employees, especially at the top of the hierarchy.	38.210925437650815
It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees.	24.575201876431834
I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed.	19.652564262376984
After all, the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms.	128.7932208939147
Mr President, Commissioners, first of all, I cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is, on the whole, a Dutch-British-Scandinavian debate where the speakers are concerned.	58.31321850736815
Perhaps this is a little worrying.	32.19987118043703
I hope, like so many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved.	48.581374802210235
We must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner, only then to have to rush again to put out the next one. As Mr Blak said, we must instead establish a system with clear roles.	50.43262680278739
First of all, we need tough regulations, which can be implemented.	40.062754693160976
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough.	42.58766856794276
There need to be tough rules stating, among other things, what may be decentralised, what may be outsourced and what is independent.	84.09813784579917
I find it a little worrying that people are clamouring for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exercised.	45.14425776612746
What we need, then, are basic administrative regulations for the EU, for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States.	47.12929503870922
These are what are missing.	49.098507168957816
We have asked for a Public Prosecutor' s Office and criminal law, but we also need administrative law for the EU.	34.58641053976226
We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt, as binding regulations, the ombudsman' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice.	68.75784370631135
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.	15.506977632506107
Secondly, we must also clarify our own auditing roles.	37.21316149330421
The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations, but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action.	33.09345495790419
It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation.	26.009812564236697
We do not hunt down criminals. That is OLAF' s job.	62.463359407157796
Tell me what national parliament, for example, is handed all preliminary investigation documents.	208.7635473402876
Obstinate as I am, I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the Internet. Otherwise, we shall not get anywhere in this fight.	56.49426656861182
Mr President, I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report.	10.984658678860892
I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch, now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so. Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this.	58.839301711201834
I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement, also with its amendments.	25.875402292372392
I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic.	91.39624821360911
I think that this is also the case here, but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments.	39.759192115122175
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective.	43.393583910303754
Mr President, one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is, to my mind, the rapporteur' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration.	30.345976436702504
A very important proposal indeed.	106.55762440915402
I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan, because she wants to scrap it altogether.	35.07439979330498
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale.	93.32063575515434
On the one hand, we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well, as a result of which, in fact, the entire content of this report vanishes.	35.05789632217168
I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock, but I happen to know Mr Kinnock.	29.409033230280535
He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary.	61.91296205085415
In my opinion, such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary.	39.694841678486675
Finally, the issue of officials.	83.96394638031136
Actually, I do not entirely share Mr Haarder' s view.	56.29827904716699
I do agree that the section on officials has, in fact, been completed totally inadequately.	84.68965472346827
First of all, the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised. Secondly, all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted, and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement.	62.30355994477614
For example, we are currently looking into TAOs. This is a key point but, at the same time, we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission.	31.63104998533366
These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other, and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table.	66.79276922569358
Mr President, ever since Plato' s 'Republic' , the Western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts.	104.74020634618364
Our Parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the European Commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine, themselves, what its future should be.	101.4070899359653
In this second report, the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in Parliament, which may have hesitated to remove the European Commission from office, since they shared the political affiliations of some of its members.	78.71102342671713
The experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the Commissioners from belonging to political groups.	52.73750045305746
According to the experts, Parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the European Commission. This task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life, and this should be a standing committee, not elected, presumably made up of another group of experts.	81.26454710665836
In this, their second report, the experts tell us that Italy is financed by the Cohesion Fund, that the ERDF and the Social Fund represent two-thirds of the Structural Funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the Structural Funds come to the same thing. They tell us that the farming lobby is forcing us to finance rural development through the EAGGF-Guarantee and that the principle of partnership only applies to the Commission and to the Member States.	51.77336410885174
This lesson in wisdom is 100% ideology and 0% knowledge.	250.49833704297953
This will not help us to reform the European institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions.	97.18550088016178
The van Hulten report started out as a brilliant one and I would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what Mr van Hulten achieved.	56.79123389011225
Unfortunately, it was then changed, and changed for the worse, which turned it into a document which in fact, proposes something that we cannot accept.	113.40171643068895
Mr President, Mr van Hulten, your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising, arduous and complex, and I believe this is important in a first report.	47.75631352159485
Please therefore accept what I am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate, and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer.	56.202067936515384
This report seems to me to be redundant, long-winded, confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used.	53.58475420895946
Perhaps 'redundant' is the most serious epithet, and you are not responsible for this. It is the responsibility of this Parliament.	30.666235297881514
That is to say, if this Parliament commissions a Committee of Experts - and I am not going to repeat what Mr Casaca has said, but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem, where is the sense in indulging in the medieval tradition of criticising the critics and so on, ad infinitum.	34.19538399011614
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission, we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them.	43.89594585056826
Meanwhile, we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence.	100.3316230907524
'Long-winded' .	241.59314599579594
I am not going to mention the length of this report.	15.953847940997914
I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here, but, for this type of resolution it certainly does.	62.89679621394534
I do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop.	84.91585975902572
It is also 'confusing' .	15.562508216999136
I am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning Parliament.	34.85717648017192
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue, but not in this report.	64.2177164009679
And finally, Mr President, frankly, I am not going to give examples, but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy.	62.3445416489884
Therefore - in summary - I await, and many of us await, your report, Commissioner Kinnock, so that we can really express our opinion on it, which is the duty of this Parliament.	62.30531277992836
Mr President, the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are.	156.70426862059196
When one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though, it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them.	70.5572829399067
Hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control.	167.65777985377645
The concept of transparency stands out in the report.	55.75223033889813
Securing this is a major priority.	59.52964469475743
The importance of smooth-running, comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough.	128.1685085238603
This is not just about bureaucratic reform, however; rather, it is about showing good will towards the citizens.	173.44737726565484
We must win back their faith in EU politics.	67.67377888355661
The citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for EU provisions to be comprehensible to them.	62.60911755693274
This is what enables them to understand what is going on.	37.66626505695267
They want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served	88.15279512942406
Whether or not the reforms succeed depends, to a very large extent, on the Commission' s own initiative.	58.36827237406899
However, it annoyed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis.	45.09065643863716
However, Mr Kinnock, your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street; rather, as Parliamentarians, we want, and must, play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week, before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control.	86.06742958048433
I believe, Mr Kinnock, that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level, the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations.	90.43773112841981
Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission's - it was the decision of this Parliament!	71.03414703405757
So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House.	109.49125141032029
She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House, there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full, formally and in detail for everything I have done.	63.430618696694275
Mr President, may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and, from what I hear, the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report.	43.064197809823874
Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects, certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance, as several Members have said, to all of our Institutions.	82.27090244153734
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative.	67.9954923412345
Mr President, as you will know, Mr van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, since I want to make a comprehensive reply, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I seek your indulgence.	37.25540877531903
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary.	80.22641993120915
When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September, I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission's reform proposals.	31.49316224220348
Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today, well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago.	104.5584182121975
I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that.	24.558210258404035
The great majority of the paper's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform.	74.73454480289134
There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile.	53.891900618945286
The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance.	99.73485559574904
I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode.	22.124321897700025
But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing, it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing.	34.472843241454264
Hence the transmission.	423.8567571400082
Though time forbids me, Mr President, from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House, I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas.	103.31169933423486
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations.	61.95965456470003
The need for transparency is rightly stressed, not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does.	69.99775386132013
This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable, not just to this House, but more generally to the European public.	48.327141819495395
Naturally, sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information, but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible.	130.47977116248896
I have repeatedly emphasised that, indeed not just as a Commissioner, but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning.	80.69614491201354
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission.	40.04064859714249
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform.	63.52002856064152
As the House knows and has repeatedly said, the scale and scope of the Union's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures.	69.25282106811119
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today's debate.	44.581094342343945
We share the view, forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts, and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures.	44.92714900175787
The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April.	40.09621873256166
Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital.	334.3492954082414
I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law.	50.4468292350376
Change in the law is fundamental.	180.8471754230597
There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy, but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system.	50.998346615282635
Essentially - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that Directors-General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the European Union budget.	109.52801306630508
In addition, and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system, the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - "the second key" as Herr Bösch said, established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts.	63.65404583758738
That service will open on 1 May this year.	258.745949702034
It will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation.	48.580031227316915
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening.	48.16677903794467
As Budgets Commissioner, here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors.	242.22180572167233
This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits.	87.18009995035716
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them.	64.6504395146008
The proposed change will make the systems more effective, both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes.	61.2213358793396
I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called "a big bang approach".	52.55321758470409
Financial control' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate.	95.41243753238248
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts.	43.13848415550447
That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa.	56.236327795910185
It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control.	73.08029312544622
In addition, I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997.	39.710166832216906
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson' s comments to this House last month. "The Commission's internal control" he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation.	72.39363060590574
For instance, the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered.	152.52477787213917
At the same time, the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies, notably the same Financial Controller, the Inspectorate General and by some units operating Directorates-General."	55.48807415227714
The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but, over the years, it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions.	66.5628002301876
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this.	19.791067197912465
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition.	83.31867790313568
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document.	106.12250914811956
Our objective, the committee' s objective, the Court of Auditors' objective is not to abolish financial control, it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control.	54.67391066031407
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months.	45.93625948435748
Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud, corruption, mismanagement and nepotism: the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing.	238.77667886163132
As I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions, we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed.	56.79526897887081
Since June of last year, the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities.	191.93373326087786
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line.	233.67334512149648
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed.	107.09941905335678
We are seeking to implement best practice.	51.91932425569974
Serious response to reports, confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure.	222.88082058793697
As a corollary, there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations.	55.56305602122576
A communication later this year will give full details.	97.92471329259807
I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose.	46.768196018629375
I am persuaded, however, by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability.	92.97906702072994
We already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness, fairness, consistency and professionalism.	100.16274014431367
And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament.	65.4627554210042
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change.	93.68221928948576
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House.	75.61588858805804
With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework.	38.42688017701806
This will be taken a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life.	52.94591625889874
That is in line with the draft resolution.	18.411470751220488
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions.	59.24891880849588
I welcome Parliament's support for that.	29.62443815876665
We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents, made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten's report.	51.18857473423446
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission's accountability to this Parliament.	33.13366361629602
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission's practical commitment to that.	41.662974274732846
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents.	42.738779262798715
The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors.	40.522053677758905
I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament.	56.133129023009275
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text.	52.45839103909472
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible.	20.124478552549462
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform.	107.6050170728915
I am glad to say to Mr van Hulten and Mr Haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment, training, appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals.	40.72884638648803
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions.	32.93479587043918
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities.	84.42591988765885
Members, who, in the course of this debate, have properly praised Commission officials, who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity, hard-working and of great capability, are absolutely right in the comments that they have made.	83.00485161621242
While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points, detail and precision are obviously essential.	137.91054145270357
A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months.	34.756738287588114
Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House.	50.000563389145896
It is, meanwhile, very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament, as an institution, on central matters of common interest, notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations.	61.642715074390566
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay, conditions, staff representation rights and so on, but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters.	144.2467924507851
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome.	122.91175930347036
I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change.	76.15845651742347
That is most certainly relevant.	86.16392798592393
We are sure that there will be an important "reform dividend" as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources.	54.96018219812114
It is very clear, however, that parts of the Commission services are already very stretched.	35.0015471682595
Parliament has frequently made that point.	143.65949054313148
Secondly, it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology.	63.099053687103584
Thirdly, it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken.	39.15234048569198
They are already having implications for resource availability.	146.40988811144467
It is also clear that if we take on new tasks - which we will surely be asked to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called "negative priorities" and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity.	47.07357249520902
A central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management.	55.20505448446488
I want to emphasise, however, that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission, it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission.	70.16671424365843
The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten's report.	29.44282077855631
I conclude, Mr President, by thanking the House for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur, to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committees which gave their opinions.	48.53834096871904
We look forward to working closely with this House on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then, most important of all, working together with this House on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities.	63.60853319462921
The debate is closed.	3.7754887131066557
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	3.2691741867479744
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)	6.905284429068592
Middle East peace process (continuation)	122.45563419585126
The next item is the continuation of the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East peace process.	14.044317625796532
I am very grateful to the President of the Council for the statement this morning on the Middle East at the beginning of this debate and for hearing some of Minister Gama' s insights, as he arrived hot-foot from the region.	28.81377102958649
My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East, even though, as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki.	100.19507977513383
Such is life.	328.3599115650042
I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would, in all normal circumstances, wish to do.	29.621634273934003
The debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis I had arranged to see visitors from the Balkans this evening.	44.4038377285913
So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion.	22.030266109215617
It is not something, I assure you, which I would wish to make a practice of.	43.28779240233687
Like honourable Members, I welcome the United States' efforts that have relaunched the Syrian/Israeli negotiations, despite the Syrian decision that they needed more time before resuming the talks that were scheduled to start again today.	160.29614799109785
There is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future. I also hope that progress in the Syrian track will pave the way for an early resumption of Lebanese/Israeli talks which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on Israel's relations with its northern neighbours.	97.52926741715345
At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track.	13.472441887506992
The situation of the Palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict.	44.966091340578416
A fair and, indeed, generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the Middle East.	60.218208732643994
Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.	60.62987913145358
Although there has been some slippage, I trust that the remaining Israeli troop redeployments will materialise soon.	52.06996629008217
Similarly, despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the Framework Agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid-February deadline, I very much hope that the much more important September deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached.	130.18450990586618
I was reassured that this was also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat, when they met on Monday.	69.14446063924085
Honourable Members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track.	72.61638479691163
This is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible, in close liaison with the US and Russian co-sponsors as well as the regional parties.	41.96088884848776
We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development.	41.8961512801107
The beginning of the talks with Syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of the month.	47.53866676152903
I look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again.	71.3168935778819
The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process, as all sides - Palestinians, Israelis, their Arab neighbours and the United States - have acknowledged.	46.830255720582876
Nor is our role confined to that of banker.	85.83394113836484
We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region.	25.834323541229715
But we should not kid ourselves: a comprehensive Middle East peace deal comes with a hefty price tag.	80.55140174363596
The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments.	51.22584804810838
We intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with Parliament and Council soon.	80.03083170874633
But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process.	18.44488422134278
We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians.	73.14032499014843
We have also offered very substantial support to Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.	84.8595554010608
With the Israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them.	65.50125492416468
The Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the Palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza.	77.47682999070328
European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 860 million during that crucial period.	166.70324055908546
In this context, let me applaud the important steps that the Palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency.	69.77235194098212
President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week.	100.29388297405653
This will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law.	37.109606297043044
The Commission is actively involved in those efforts.	53.97979397018469
The Commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs.	65.10814843278969
We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year.	72.53229188307674
This package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels.	131.76977996921156
Members will recall that the European Union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East.	54.84410286324406
A number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of Community support in the coming phase of the peace process - among them, helping to consolidate a Golan settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the rebuilding of communities in the Golan Heights.	111.14826388854401
Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy.	106.75551211021157
Reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon, the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict, will also demand considerable efforts. We also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole.	122.69334242478362
A solution is needed to the Palestinian refugee problem - these are the largest group of refugees in the world, numbering nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenges ahead.	107.19424503988452
We must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region's very scarce water resources.	80.36153525907693
Lastly, but maybe most importantly, we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas, bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems.	93.50780694102068
It is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magnitude of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace.	36.171451944082946
I want to underline that point.	33.94616820840495
I wish insistently to remind the Council and, should it be necessary, Parliament, that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing.	56.92047189195092
I repeat that a change in the politics of the Middle East will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide. I hope I can add that we will want to provide that.	50.571298376831464
We have made progress in recent months and weeks, as Mr Gama mentioned earlier.	29.695910144367296
But it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disappointments on the way.	66.18859854363704
We will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome.	59.647563007442166
Lastly, I will repeat for some who have entered the Chamber in the last few minutes, what I said at the outset of my remarks: that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate, largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the Balkans for this evening.	47.661857774511844
I hope the House will understand that.	50.87428190056454
Mr President, Commissioner Patten has our understanding.	30.766807314179626
I would like to tell him that communications with Madrid are usually more fluid and, therefore, I hope to see him there soon.	52.94513362069554
The statements we have heard today on the Middle East peace process are very opportune at the moment because of the hurried tour which Minister Gama - whose absence from this debate I also regret - has made of the region, accompanied by other Council representatives.	74.57488719407817
The tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation.	44.82078171062141
I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation.	31.802029710630347
In this sense, I share Commissioner Patten' s positive attitude.	33.8039664427385
Let me explain: it is true that the Israeli Government has delayed the third hand-over of West Bank territory to the Palestinian authorities.	92.95743363127875
It is also true, however, that, since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements, 39% of the territory of the West Bank has been handed over to the Palestinian National Authority, together with two thirds of the Gaza Strip and, more importantly, this agreement has so far been scrupulously complied with, since, under the terms laid down in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Israeli Government has the right to delay that handover.	54.98802114099482
This is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks, as Prime Minister Barak has promised.	77.46268179523412
On the other hand, the decision to delay the second round of talks, initiated in Shepherdstown by the Syrian Arab Republic, is undoubtedly significant, but I am convinced that the hopes which were raised on 3 January in that town will not be dashed.	59.621316656640474
Mr President, the fact that the different groups in this Parliament are tabling a motion for a resolution, in this ever controversial debate, which is the result of a broad consensus, seems to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace processes.	57.97826103191854
I would therefore like, equally firmly, to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences, which are still no doubt profound, between the parties.	60.93271959469892
In my judgement, this constitutes a guarantee to both sides, both from a political and a financial point of view, of the commitment they can expect from the European Union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for.	53.68996222549201
It is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to cooperating in the development which is needed to heal the serious social differences which exist.	41.50493912230149
But this also serves to make a claim, on the part of the European Union, for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution - we do not have aspirations to be bankers - and which will be suitably visible to the public.	34.02869962347059
There is absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the President of the European Parliament to the region will contribute to this.	22.11344255916917
Mr President, I want to thank Commissioner Patten for his detailed account.	15.36608721732013
I should like to say that I agree with the tone which Galeote Quecedo' s speech set here.	28.01558075234143
We in Parliament strongly support the Middle East peace process.	47.54925399097351
It is, of course, a peace process which is finally under way.	34.36013218076787
If we think of how the process was looking a year ago, the difference between then and now is like that between night and day, despite difficulties and delays.	203.46811698290344
I want to emphasise four points.	36.63314166050255
First of all, the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement contains, as everyone knows, a concrete timetable for the implementation of Israel' s commitments. This applies both to the interim agreement and to the Hebron and Wye Agreements.	51.36508414614599
While the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun, I think it is important to keep the two processes apart.	112.48853174431541
A lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreements.	94.2972517421071
What we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the harbours in Gaza, the northern transit route between Gaza and the West Bank, further releases of political prisoners and implementation of the financial commitments.	93.0454615184579
The second point relates to Syria.	27.88258925101563
There, the border question is obviously central.	238.00313364952612
How negotiations are proceeding there, we still do not know.	104.13533953427563
What is important, however, is that they have begun.	44.8481464949909
An important question in this context is the future distribution of water.	38.82375667969741
As things are at present, the Golan Heights account for between a third and a sixth of Israel's water supply.	198.50540065118153
The third aspect is the peace negotiations in Syria which are closely linked to the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon.	79.67675189320768
According to UNIFIL, there are now concrete signs that Israel is preparing to withdraw, which is something we welcome.	109.65562574900716
There too, of course, outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the Lebanese Palestinian refugees.	113.80680474118004
My last point concerns the future Palestinian State.	135.17360890565587
This may be proclaimed in the course of this year, with or without Israel' s support.	49.642041478943426
The Barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party.	92.16522915796901
Even if negotiations are not completed by September of this year, there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a Palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date.	88.36633655065266
In this context, it is important for those of us who support the idea of a Palestinian state that the latter should be as Commissioner Patten said, namely a state subject to public control, and that it should be a democratic state.	40.214886266197844
This is something to which we all want to contribute.	27.965069698746326
Mr President, I would like to refer, firstly and above all, to the joint resolution which will be laid down to round off this debate. My Group has made a contribution to this resolution and, needless to say, approves of it.	40.031341905211214
More specifically, however, I would like to express our delight at the fact that, after such a long time, Israel and Syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion.	66.80920547318466
The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East.	46.64133181228707
It is, therefore, regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being.	71.98397187920366
Indeed, both parties will need to make huge efforts.	105.89700839492701
Lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the Israeli borders, as well as Syria' s integrity.	65.30082493404217
It is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue.	62.06359114311856
In addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria, I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiations with Lebanon within the foreseeable future and that, in the framework of economic and regional cooperation, a multilateral approach will appear possible.	79.39420742322642
Nevertheless, it is still regrettable that the European Union, one of the most important financial donors, is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process.	28.73128073161971
This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of the European Union' s common foreign and security policy.	10.692569233168031
This is where Mr Solana, the High Representative to the Council, could come into his own.	38.87516317553987
The Commission and Member States also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region.	55.18492043364836
I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation.	23.87383612214372
In this respect, we support Libya' s participation, provided that it recognises human rights, renounces support for terrorists and fully supports the peace process.	83.59445833812262
There are still, needless to say, many unresolved problems and unanswered questions, also involving the Palestinians.	99.07089309481678
Everyone knows that the peace process is a protracted and difficult affair but we are convinced that, with the necessary trust, perseverance and indispensable political will, our common goal, namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East, will be achieved.	83.8457199756355
Mr President, it is pleasing that, despite certain delays and problems, the peace negotiations are going on both between Israel and Palestine and between Israel and Syria.	116.0004880585185
The moment of truth is approaching.	144.67511502935943
Is Israel prepared to comply with the UN' s resolutions and, in exchange for peace and security, hand back the Arab areas which were conquered in 1967?	155.87220968133803
Will Israel let Palestinian refugees return or be given compensation?	1205.845059124605
Will Israel share Jerusalem and the water of the River Jordan?	108.97647885631554
Will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and, therefore, reliable as a partner in peace?	138.1325972094991
Will Syria fully accept Israel' s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law?	145.8022377151569
The fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country, Israel, does not prevent the Arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility.	79.46635988521132
Peace in the Middle East concerns us all, however.	116.13885387227448
It is therefore good that the EU should act as a godparent to the Palestinian state.	23.692838164533807
Against this background, I want to conclude with a remarkable story from Sweden where an international Intergovernmental Conference on Hitler' s extermination of the Jews is being held, which is obviously a welcome initiative.	80.75661794367386
Of 47 states invited from all corners of the world, not one of them, however, is an Arab state included in the EU' s Barcelona process.	110.72116762243589
This has been interpreted as indicating that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regarded by Europeans as being similar to the Nazis' anti-Semitism, which of course is completely incorrect.	82.90576341439467
The Arab world' s criticism of Israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as, for example, Algeria' s fight for freedom against France.	90.26923005640353
But today, Egypt, Jordan and Palestine have peace treaties with Israel.	371.7311689657671
I therefore wonder whether Commissioner Patten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have invited at least one Arab state to the holocaust conference in Stockholm.	47.96021526333978
Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to completion.	28.24021086752856
It is high time there was peace in the Middle East.	29.312032980136372
It is time to end the era which began with the Balfour declaration in 1917 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. It is time there were secure borders and political, social and economic rights in every country in this region, and that human rights were recognised and upheld in Syria, Palestine, Israel and everywhere else.	117.83863592590764
This is an exercise in sovereignty, and in democracy for each population and every individual, but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights, and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given.	84.12039691100884
I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question, but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the Golan since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982.	95.66541268208493
Israel has to accept its responsibilities, withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but, at the same time, it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area.	38.046930457841206
However, Israel is not the only country concerned with security.	103.89825606191714
The same goes for the other countries, especially for the Palestinians, who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas B and C, despite the Oslo Agreement and subsequent agreements. Between the period when the Oslo Agreement was signed and 17 October 1999, 174 000 dunams of land were confiscated, 8 462 of which have been taken under Mr Barak' s Government.	93.07918695449958
Trees have been uprooted, houses are still being demolished and, above all, water supplies have been reduced or refused, especially in East Jerusalem, while the settlements continue and are growing constantly.	98.63817140511244
Nevertheless, there is no doubt that with the election of the new government, positive steps have been taken: negotiations, at least, have resumed. But in the Middle East, there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state, if they cannot move freely within their own territory.	60.879281868603165
All the international community has to do is implement Resolutions 332, 248, 245 and 194.	45.54723433017198
We are concerned by the deferment of the building of relations with Syria, as well as Mr Barak' s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el­-Sheikh agreements.	44.02012817835878
We feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid.	30.974509639970126
We cannot be content with a role backstage. We must be leading protagonists while staying off a collision course with the United States, as Minister Gama said.	113.54255883807863
Mr President, firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comments here today, particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process, and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of "banker" for the entire operation.	40.557245417493014
I was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria had been suspended.	108.44199271883414
I very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date.	44.93804388452239
Nevertheless, we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late.	53.35367060018
The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome.	52.18467781036284
Political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East.	70.1076855464025
I know that if agreement can be reached between Syria and Israel, the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum.	119.17800201726729
The settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security.	44.15348257359084
If Syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the Israel/Syria question might be promising.	278.48388634680055
On the issue of Palestine, I recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the Wye Agreement.	37.559890785340265
The key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of redeployment, as well as the transfer of territories.	66.63879648280746
The low level of releases of Palestinian prisoners and the fact that the Israeli Government appears to intend halting implementation of building permits already granted, as well as not approving new ones, pose further obstacles.	173.46606986375343
These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations, although, I believe, these talks will not be held up indefinitely.	138.41400277317436
At present, the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the Palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first, while the Israeli Government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security.	81.79349300848511
Currently, both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed.	158.00608017460414
In conclusion, while other countries in the Middle East have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process, now that the Syrian Government has been brought into the peace process, Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward.	46.19086402265855
I sincerely hope that, in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East, all the key protagonists will move forward quickly, in the very near future, so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved.	43.128046127191595
Mr President, the various motions for resolutions tabled in Parliament more or less represent the situation in the Middle East.	52.034286983522264
There are those who are in favour of new agreements between Israel and Syria, but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the Middle East issue.	57.56230287115369
Indeed, the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability.	69.71545010075911
The time has come for Israel to fulfil its promises of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territories, at last recognising once and for all the authority of Palestine, whose resumed diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it is under the wise leadership of Yasser Arafat.	133.39616987375177
It is equally important not to lose sight of the Iraq question, which no one discusses anymore, thereby relegating the problems of millions of women, elderly people and children, the victims of an embargo as arrogant as it is wicked, to oblivion.	50.314112698085815
I do not know what Syria and Israel will want or be able to do in reality, but I do know that our institution can do a lot and it is time that it attached the same importance to peoples' lives as it does to the ballasts of the cold, colourless, artificial neon bulbs in our lamps, which can illuminate houses but not the world in the third millennium.	67.20591655920265
Mr President, the Israeli author, Amos Oz, managed to capture very aptly the icy atmosphere at the negotiating table between the Israelis and Syrians recently.	69.26447892762329
He was under the impression that the Syrians thought that, in exchange for the Golan Heights, all they had to do was to fax the Israelis a receipt.	95.03629045024952
Oz' s impression is also echoed in the Israeli press.	97.12189460735105
It contrasts Prime Minister Barak' s personal peace efforts and the distant attitude, even physical absence, of the strong man of Damascus, President Assad, at the negotiations in the United States.	125.1362224575594
Surely Assad would be Barak' s ideal negotiating partner and not the Foreign Affairs Minister.	143.99547502004333
And the Israelis were certainly not impressed by the discourteous behaviour of Minister Farouk al-Shara in Shepherdstown.	40.62383654914737
His behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak was plainly insulting.	168.94679377191602
But why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic niceties in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory?	255.27495835398116
Well, the Syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face.	160.96926952873827
At the end of the day, Israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the Golan.	74.83036066316492
All the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater European involvement in the peace process.	159.35228832381384
It is, however, very much in doubt whether Brussels can make available the billions of dollars which the Israeli and Syrian authorities require from their peace patron, the United States, not to mention the heavy, equally costly, security guarantees in case of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan.	162.72319260877052
I would like to finish off by asking the European Council and Commission a question.	21.99119124895239
How accurate are the press reports which state that the Portuguese Presidency has already pledged troops as a peacekeeping force in the Golan?	78.28047079380629
Mr President, the truth is that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talks between Syria and Israel is not good news, but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured 16 people.	80.14058354728755
It is clear that, for once, the United States has not been able to secure progress on the restarting of these negotiations, and it is true that the obstacles are difficult to overcome: the Syrians wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Golan Heights and re-establish the borders which existed before 4 June 1967, while the Israelis wish, since they consider that it suits their situation better, to have the borders which were set in 1923.	77.35379399685839
The suspension of the talks between Syria and Israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the Middle East.	27.95521036411584
The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authorities and Israel is also suspended at the moment.	33.82358087912895
After the talks which took place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Leader of the Palestinian Authority, the Israeli Prime Minister requested a delay of two months as from 13 February, the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.	63.89288222191479
What can the European Union do in these circumstances?	37.67092614043417
Unfortunately, very little.	255.89736334819057
It naturally has to support these negotiations, sponsored by the United States; contacts have to be increased; the presence of the European Union envoy, Ambassador Moratinos, who has fulfilled his mission with great diligence and efficiency, within the powers of the European Union, is positive.	57.656855925856796
But none of this hides the fact that there is a certain sense of impotence, because when the negotiators from each side fly back to the United States this weekend, we will have to remember that, for every 100 dollars spent on the peace process in the region, 60 are contributed by the European Union.	48.267172022140116
When we consider that a conference will soon be held in Moscow, it becomes clear that the European Union' s presence in this peace process is somewhat pitiful.	36.19859305627903
I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a greater role, that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the European Union in this process.	27.52986395833482
I hope that the forthcoming visit by the President of the European Parliament to the region, as well as the presidents of the relevant interparliamentary delegations, will begin an era of greater initiative and a greater presence for the European Union in this complicated and difficult peace process.	44.46517704899468
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I should like to thank you for your statements, especially Commissioner Patten, whose analysis I fully share and I shall not, therefore, repeat any of his ideas.	27.657190011401486
I should just like to make three comments which Commissioner Patten will perhaps see as similar but which, for various reasons, a Member can formulate more openly.	84.10507562520525
First, I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian authorities.	37.35319867910335
But we have enough agreements now: Oslo, Wye Plantation, Sharm el-Sheikh.	122.43315557155611
We have enough agreements; they just need to be implemented.	81.27109611304637
However, in this regard I share Mr Salafranca' s scepticism when he says that there has been bad news from Israel this week, namely that the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum cannot be implemented within the set timeframe.	52.86044990009845
My second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel.	47.34186190057469
I consider this to be very encouraging news.	64.97968287042185
But we have also learned this week that Mr Barak will not be travelling to Washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued.	42.35554027297465
I should like to make it quite clear: if the Golan Heights are returned to Syria, the problem in this region will be solved.	34.465800306879736
On the question of the referendum which various Members have referred to: we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations.	67.93741554086355
In Germany, there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay.	39.900295273734024
That would be a similar situation.	48.376919816186
My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union.	32.67583078736101
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos' special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there, Commissioner Patten.	67.5809713259711
You know that you will always have our support here in Parliament, and that includes your proposal, and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it.	72.94771463310094
But we must also play a political role and Mr Moratinos cannot play that role in this region on his own; the Presidency of the Council must take action, the EU High Representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the Russians did and invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves.	70.80601552248255
Then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution.	83.0423025509035
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, the recent peace talks begun in the USA between Israel and Syria mark a turning point in the history of the Middle East. It has taken fifty years to reach this point, which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations.	83.34180364691571
There will be no meeting today in Shepherdstown but we must hope, as Mr Patten said just now, that this postponement of the negotiations due to Syrian requirements will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the Middle East.	65.5185292896495
This hope is contained in our motion for a resolution. We hope for a fair and balanced agreement based on respect for sovereignties and the right to live securely within safe and recognised borders.	75.11560881093725
All the foreign troops, including therefore the Syrian forces, must withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 520 of the United Nations Security Council.	113.90154061147332
Dare we hope for an Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon by July 2000, the date promised by Ehud Barak?	160.90948760808433
Dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between Israel and its neighbours to the north?	104.60015713365874
We really hope and believe so.	137.41762606052833
Never have the parties been so determined.	268.1500026983959
One fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from Europe and which must exist between the people. There must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations.	53.74362389240966
Following the attack in Hadera on Monday, we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism.	79.41378247795852
In terms of balance, or should I say imbalance, I must add that it is to be regretted that Europe is still playing a minor political role in resolving this conflict.	49.281519481007955
At midday, Mr Gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by Europe to the region.	65.23092673728975
Despite everything, we are being forced to recognise that the resumption of the peace process is largely due to the work of Washington.	40.40013906473507
Like other Arab countries before them, the Syrians chose the Americans to sponsor the negotiations.	122.79711519743891
This was the choice also made by Israel where Europe suffers from a partisan public image, and this is a fact, not a judgement.	91.15703992127838
This is now the opportunity to reiterate to Mr Patten, Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos how much we are relying on their efforts to include Europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict.	43.58264054269754
Although it is difficult for Europe to speak with one voice about the peace process, it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity.	61.25348537902018
The next item is questions to the Council (B5-0040/99) and the Commission (B5-0041/99), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the 1999 annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice (Article 39 of the TEU).	21.656258624359204
Mr President, 1999 was the year of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, of the communitisation of the Schengen Agreement and of the Extraordinary Tampere Council.	40.95203034218352
These have been the most important moments in the Council' s expression of its political will to establish an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.	24.45883361296342
The Council has decided to draw up a charter of citizens' rights - and we rejoice in this; it has decided to implement Article 13 of the Treaty, combating all forms of discrimination and xenophobia, and it has decided to approximate the laws on conditions for admission and residence, as well as guaranteeing residents treatment which is fair and on an equal footing with the citizens of the Union.	47.42679501127801
It has also reached a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposals for civil cooperation.	73.40659869762662
This has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a Community framework.	39.678983203667926
They have been put into the hands of a single Commissioner, Mr Antonio Vitorino, and we congratulate them on this as well.	59.41530251083282
Furthermore, they have taken on the task of creating a "scoreboard" to verify the progress made in this area at Community level, but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the Member States.	35.57829848694462
We are pleased about this and we congratulate the Council on these decisions, despite the fact that, for this House, the Treaty of Amsterdam included one disappointment: that of delaying, for five years, our role, our ability to participate actively, to democratically control this area of freedom, security and justice, as well as the role taken in it by the Court of Justice.	53.282915219839076
However, if, on verifying the progress made during 1999, which is within the competence of this Parliament in accordance with the Treaty, we leave behind the stage of great declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out, the scene looks considerably darker, Mr President.	109.04394905074813
It is as if the Council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to, the other begrudges.	84.45446722073709
Despite all the commitments made at the highest level, the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged.	52.137644143406824
Programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or, at least, this Parliament is unable to do so.	48.799560180563795
We have presented the Council with a series of questions and I know that it is the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them.	43.70425888752321
We hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament.	41.644333778644985
I said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out.	31.619815250296575
There are doubts in my Group and doubts also persist in this House, for example, about something which should be good news: the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Community framework.	72.89694740259692
Schengen has been incorporated, as we said earlier, into the acquis, but it has been done with very little transparency.	122.39147886254851
Not a single piece of information, nor a single consultation, has been addressed to Parliament during this process; neither on the association of the United Kingdom, nor on the incorporation of Greece, nor on the negotiations with Norway and Iceland.	144.6144196704154
The same is true with regard to immigration policy.	32.86478105963682
We have amused ourselves with a pile of reports, but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives; they have disappeared.	44.66027593536537
We hope that 2000 will be the year for action, in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations.	70.83529404250488
We hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament.	26.457997397577998
The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the Union.	27.403574888466757
The Council can act in accordance with Parliament' s decisions, or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project.	55.95661531552215
If it chooses the second approach, it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom, security and justice is built.	57.804737276260134
Alternatively, it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions, in order to move forward in another way.	69.56565246772314
Fulfil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit, thus preparing for the future.	261.0286135009813
Provide the Commission with the necessary resources and recognition essential for it to carry out its work and for it to verify the real progress made at Community level and at the level of the Member States, and we will be - and the Council will be - able to deal with the decisions made at Tampere and move towards a Union which is freer, more just and more secure.	48.71852189701555
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I do not have a background as a Member of the European Parliament, you will understand that it is even more moving for me to be here than it is for my colleague Fernando Gomes.	25.564379844425027
As Mrs Terrón i Cusí said in her speech, 1999 was a year of great expectations in the field of justice and home affairs - an expectation realised with the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, an expectation realised with the conclusions of the Tampere Council, and a fundamental expectation, as from this year, that will be realised in the form of specific actions.	62.37891691469371
We are all aware that, to this end, it is essential for the Council to approve, as quickly as possible, the scoreboard which Commissioner Vitorino has the remit of establishing.	47.38743888169674
I must stress once again the Portuguese Presidency' s earnest desire for political agreement to be reached on the scoreboard at the informal Council in Lisbon on 3 and 4 March.	62.054388021110874
Turning to the specific questions that Mrs Terrón i Cusí has put to us, I shall group them into three basic areas: the fight against organised crime, the operation of the Judicial Network, particularly as regards criminal matters, and questions on Europol.	123.86997959496611
Regarding the fight against organised crime, 1999 marked the implementation of several important actions stemming from the Vienna action plan, which resulted in the signing of the Charter of European Professional Associations, in developments in cooperation and in establishing points of contact between the Member States for receiving information relevant to the fight against money laundering. And I must not forget the Finnish Presidency' s proposal for a Council decision which is being considered in the Multi-disciplinary Group.	80.76362665942247
This is an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work, not just by securing approval for the EU strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millennium, but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the divergence of views that exists, particularly at Council level, on issues concerning the fight against organised crime.	55.36414754824203
With this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the French Presidency, with the aim of organising a Jumbo JHA-ECOFIN Council.	92.48872403577371
If this is not to be a mere media event, it will need to be carefully prepared by a joint committee, the composition of which the Portuguese Presidency has already proposed.	52.78580518554092
Our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime.	44.99499305038443
Here, in addition to the work being done in the group of experts on the Pre-Accession Pact, it is important that it has proved possible to draw up a joint action plan for the fight against organised crime between the European Union and the Russian Federation, a plan which is now being finalised, and to organise meetings of liaison officials from the Member States, in Moscow, and to develop a set of further initiatives.	35.540876305748085
Another area is EU involvement in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its various protocols, and in the conventions being prepared in the framework of the Council of Europe, in particular on cyber crime.	103.4470144158821
As this is an issue which has become important in the justice and home affairs programme, the presidency believes that it is worthwhile, bearing in mind the principles of Chapter VI of the Treaty, to explore suitable means of providing the European Parliament with improved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiations under the United Nations Convention.	54.244218645722114
With regard to the Judicial Network, significant progress has been made, in particular the launch at the end of 1999 of the dedicated telecommunications system of the European Judicial Network, whilst the Multi-disciplinary Group has developed a series of actions to implement the 1997 action plan.	85.77719164369482
However, we must stress that it is vital for approval to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millennium, so as to give a fresh impetus, while preserving continuity, to the work done under the previous action plan.	47.952028783941635
Still on judicial cooperation, considerable progress has been made on the legal protection of the euro, and the European Parliament is being consulted on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance.	45.08124002759289
We believe that if legal protection of the euro is to be credible, we must avoid having a multiplicity of instruments, and we should accordingly make a combined effort in March to approve a single instrument covering all necessary aspects, including those featuring in initiatives already presented by France and those whose adoption the Commission itself has called for.	118.87452707041369
It is important in this field to implement measures relating to the mutual recognition of judicial decisions, and we believe that on the basis of work already done, it will be possible, at least in the field of seizure of assets, for measures to be adopted in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial decisions.	53.02485799104231
Lastly then, Europol, which started its work in 1999. The Council approved a set of instruments, with which Parliament is familiar, to make Europol' s operations viable but, of course, the fundamental issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol still remain, and these are issues which have naturally taken on a new dimension in view of the political decision taken in Tampere to reinforce Europol' s powers and, above all, to give it an operational dimension.	145.67242484664132
The French Presidency has passed an important working document to us which sets out various scenarios for addressing and resolving the issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol.	115.45566289616109
The Portuguese Presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the Eurojust network, since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of Europol to be a matter for Eurojust, this option cannot be ruled out at present.	91.37624666512467
For this reason, it is essential that the Council' s debates on the future of Europol and Eurojust should be conducted in parallel, so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also.	48.75891376500704
I believe that in this context, and in the context of the dialogue that the Council and Parliament will have to establish on the future of Europol and Eurojust, it will be possible for us to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the Council and Parliament with regard to Europol.	27.727101962969886
We are familiar with Parliament' s views and we know that Parliament is aware of the views of the Council' s legal advisers.	30.02883305482111
I believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolving the issue of democratic control of Europol, and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all parties involved.	45.88027385362837
Mr President, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, without wishing to compete with the Ministers as regards emotions, I have to say that I am not moved, rather I am disturbed to have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time, and I just hope that this fact will not alter the separation of powers which is essential for the proper functioning of the Union!	34.75876028952789
I would also like to thank Mrs Terrón i Cusí for having asked the question which has given rise to the first annual debate of this parliamentary term on the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, and to thank all the Members who, in their various committees, have actively participated in preparing this annual debate. I would also like to thank the representatives of the national parliaments and of civil society.	29.958359680402875
In this first speech, I would like to share with Parliament the Commission' s view of the most important events in 1999.	26.632166469264906
I believe that I can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that 1999 was both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the Union on issues of freedom, security and justice.	78.70438048274468
It has already been mentioned that the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force in May and this Parliament stated that the most far-reaching innovation in this Treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom, security and justice.	30.872345955783587
At the same time, it also represents a quantum leap in qualitative terms, and a logical and vital step in the development of the Union, in the wake of the establishment of the internal market, the introduction of the single currency and the launching of a common foreign and security policy.	20.00197011209237
This project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common Union.	45.48465174146738
And it will therefore be necessary to guarantee genuine freedom of movement to all citizens residing in the territory of the European Union, recognising that this is only meaningful if it is rooted in a secure base, with solid foundations in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have easy access, on equal terms, and in which our citizens can have real confidence.	77.15336194331542
The Union' s commitment to establishing an area of freedom, security and justice was confirmed at Tampere.	39.51325633508262
I would like to emphasise the strong political message sent out by the European Council, reaffirming the importance that the Heads of State and Government of the Union attached to a fundamental project, together with various political guidelines and priorities which will turn this area into a reality, following a progressive strategy, within a time-frame of five years, and that, above all, the three components of this area should be in balance: freedom, security and justice.	70.06337144437805
1999 was also marked by the German Presidency' s initiative to draw up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights.	44.88546860672106
I believe that at the present stage in the European Union' s development, it would be appropriate to bring together the fundamental rights in force at European Union level in a charter, so as to make them as visible and accessible as possible to our citizens.	52.24748443990516
As I have already said on a number of occasions, I am in favour - the Commission is in favour - of drawing up a charter which would reflect, on the broadest basis possible and as part of a dynamic process, the common constitutional traditions of the Member States and the general principles of Community law, rather than being a mere statement of the lowest common denominator.	41.173973240070836
In my capacity as a representative of the Commission, I will ensure that the charter and the actions stemming from it represent an affirmation of a Union based on a set of fundamental rights which are an integral part of Europe' s common heritage.	39.1408138957068
That is the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged European Union in the eyes of every European citizen, an enlarged Europe based on respect for rights and freedoms, with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection, in other words, a Union rooted in the political values which underpin contemporary democracies.	73.16031168264664
I must not overlook the fact that 1999 marked the beginning of the 1999-2004 parliamentary term of the European Parliament, that it was the year in which the new Commission took up its duties and, as a consequence, the year in which a Commissioner solely responsible for the areas of justice and home affairs assumed his responsibilities.	63.22313798387707
In addition to these events, I would like to remind Parliament of some items that were approved in 1999.	36.78627126029281
In the field of immigration, borders and asylum, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on setting up the Eurodac database, and a proposal for a directive on conditions for admitting third country nationals into Member States of the European Union with a view to reuniting families, as part of a vigorous policy of integrating legal residents in the territory of the European Union.	42.29248268372867
We also presented a communication on common procedures concerning asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Iceland and Norway on an agreement designed to extend the rules applied by the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention to those two countries.	63.50458319672012
The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and ultimately, in December, it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a European refugee fund.	52.324174724138494
In the field of judicial cooperation, the Commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the "communitisation" of certain conventions. These were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I), the convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters (Brussels II), and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters.	233.6511727708536
In 1999, we also presented a communication on victims of crime in the European Union, which led to discussions that were given greater impetus at Tampere. This communication called for minimum standards for protecting the victims of crime, in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to compensation, including the cost of justice.	90.65239837766123
We also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non-cash means of payment.	59.57453979696345
In the field of European Union legislation on combating financial crime, the Commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering.	68.6476390228197
In 1999, Europol took up its duties and we in the Commission, echoing the Portuguese Presidency' s statement today, sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to Europol under the Treaty of Amsterdam, there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between Europol and the relevant judicial institutions, and in particular Eurojust.	79.0806815288626
In 1999, the Commission also presented its contribution towards a European action plan to combat drugs, which underpins the strategy approved by the Helsinki European Council.	60.1268805061941
This list of actions, which is not exhaustive, should, here today, in the presence of the Council Presidency and of the Members of this House, help to make it clear that, while 1999 was a year of consolidation for EU action in this key area, it also - I very much hope - represented the start of a new phase, marked by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.	64.74474861095078
For this reason, 2000 will no doubt be a year for testing how the EU' s institutions respond to our citizens' demands for guaranteed freedom of movement, with respect for their rights and guarantees of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection.	156.60589008974142
In other words, 2000 will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political Union for the next decade - a test for the Council, for Parliament and for the Commission.	72.40191587352514
As I have already said, the Commission is aware of its own responsibilities and it is accordingly putting the finishing touches to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institutions and other interested parties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in complying with the deadlines set down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council.	41.928317636220946
This scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning. It will also, and above all, be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the European Union' s institutions towards the public.	61.493371353829204
It is for the public, therefore, that we are developing the area of freedom, security and justice.	31.708686088984397
The progress made will not be due to the Commission nor to the Council, nor even to the European Parliament, but to a combination of European institutions and to the Member States themselves, in as much as - as has already been pointed out here - specific tasks on the scoreboard will be entrusted to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity.	35.576466308209795
In the coming weeks, I shall be making a tour of capitals to sound out the opinions of the various ministers for justice and home affairs.	33.790912584140955
I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project.	51.37849569419856
And we hope, during the Portuguese Presidency, to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council, taking account of the soundings that I have just mentioned.	39.335605767536286
It is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions, and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny.	48.57904673482108
For this reason, and I believe that this is a challenge we are all facing, I recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the Union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in areas which are essential for citizenship, for legality and, ultimately, for democracy itself.	78.64915692299515
In addition to the scoreboard, I would like to anticipate the following initiatives that the Commission intends to present during 2000 - and I would like to emphasise that I am delighted the Portuguese Presidency is treating progress in the area of freedom, security and justice as a priority in its work programme.	28.99440445102034
I hope that in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, which is also the political message of Tampere, and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies.	45.602074239826266
Regarding immigration and asylum, the Commission intends to present proposals for creating a Community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees; to initiate an analysis of criteria and conditions for improving implementation of the Dublin Convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam; to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already published concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the Union; and to present proposals with a view to preparing legislation on the granting of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with judicial action against networks of traffickers.	88.1456495492327
I also intend to contribute to the process of clarifying the role of action plans as part of the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and to make progress in adapting Community agreements in the field of readmission by including standard clauses.	51.86795402309097
Furthermore, on the subject of crossing the external borders of Member States, which is a central issue regarding the free movement of persons, I shall, in the next few days, be presenting a proposal for a regulation updating the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold visas for crossing the external borders.	66.29267438184257
Turning to judicial cooperation, in addition to an initiative on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, I sincerely hope that it will be possible to present to the Council a proposal for minimum standards ensuring an appropriate level of legal aid in cross-border proceedings.	81.22975709550418
I also intend to continue discussions on the preparation of specific common procedural rules for simplifying and speeding up cross-border judicial proceedings relating to small commercial and consumer claims, alimony claims and non-contested claims.	127.61897813785004
As a follow-up to the Tampere and Helsinki conclusions, the Commission will be presenting its contribution to the preparation of a European Union strategy to combat organised crime.	41.431638328520656
We will be organising and supporting actions including, in particular, the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters.	68.61497851711492
The Commission also intends to present specific measures in the field of crime prevention, so as to encourage exchanges of best practice in this area, and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme financed by the Community for this purpose.	57.316184205112094
The Commission will also support the presidency' s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering, an eminently cross-pillar issue.	101.97208667190682
The Commission will fulfil the remit given to it at Tampere to present proposals for approving definitions, criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings, economic exploitation of immigrants, and sexual exploitation of woman and children, with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication, notably the Internet, for distributing child pornography.	126.67548138126523
We are also preparing a communication to instigate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime.	77.76052258496283
The year 2000 also marks the start of the implementation of the European Union Drugs Strategy 2000-2004.	56.13575218774808
In this field the Commission, in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament, will give its full support to the Interinstitutional Conference to be held on drugs in February.	36.68218979563404
With regard to Schengen, without wishing to trespass on the territory of the Council, or more precisely the incorporation of the Schengen acquis into the Community framework, I would like to stress, on the topical subject of restoring border controls, that the Commission wishes to reiterate its willingness to ensure greater control of the application of Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention in order to reinforce its authority.	60.85670110343545
The recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on Article 62 of the Treaty.	78.84411290121358
As was emphasised at Tampere, and as part of our preparations for the Feira European Council in June 2000, we will have to prepare a summary of the implications of the new external dimension of justice and home affairs with a view to adopting cross-pillar policy strategies, which strengthen the links between the Union' s internal and external policies in this field and help to uphold the Union' s position on the world stage.	58.02303749375479
Nevertheless, I must make it clear that all these actions will, of course, have to take into account the principles agreed at the Helsinki European Council concerning applicant countries, so that those applicants can cooperate and also be associated as quickly as possible with this project of creating an area of freedom, security and justice.	47.3258819520514
Furthermore, it is important to remember that 2000 will see the start of the justice and home affairs negotiations with the first group of applicant countries and I anticipate that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in preparing the negotiating dossiers on the second group with which it was agreed to open accession negotiations at Helsinki.	47.55179346291267
Lastly, I would like to state once again that the Commission intends to be in the pole position in presenting proposals for implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam.	21.598368279941504
I hope that the Commission and the Council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself. As I have told Parliament, the task before us is immense and ambitious, and the Commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge.	53.19658779324741
We hope that we can count on the support of Parliament, and - why not say it - of the Council to secure these resources and to achieve these objectives, so that the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice becomes a reality as soon as possible, thus allowing us all to contribute, in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, to the realisation of this project, which is, without a doubt, the "jewel in the crown" of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	32.7590224603877
Mr President, having devoted itself over the last 40 years to establishing a common internal market, the House now faces the major new task of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institutions of the Union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other' s competence.	84.52654282819061
Commissioner Vitorino, although I would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable, words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the Council has demonstrated towards us.	116.14605340715241
It looked, as Mr Schulz once aptly said in committee, as if the Council understood the area of freedom, security and justice to mean an area in which the Council has free rein, security from Parliament and the right to do and order as it will.	78.79348761496935
Minister Gomes, I have, of course, heard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency.	42.067679878524714
I should like to raise three points which for us, as Members of the PPE Group, must be focal points when such an area is created.	44.51391682745015
First: a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absorbing refugees must be distributed.	63.84917774820359
The Council must start by at long last ensuring that EURODAC is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classifying asylum seekers.	57.879040916528965
As far as a European asylum law is concerned, a start was in fact made at Vienna and Tampere.	73.30648845519711
Unfortunately, however, it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions.	133.0490033241864
I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union.	53.38955448978533
Similarly, it cannot be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent.	61.97463552096057
Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda.	104.41039693239553
Secondly: the introduction of a Europe-wide fight against organised crime, including by Europol and Eurojust.	70.75366856336622
The planned introduction of Eurojust is one of our significant successes from Tampere and must now be implemented forthwith.	77.54184145078808
We welcome the fact that Europol has finally been able to start work.	47.084707240456666
However, the Council should also bear in mind that, if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime, we do not only need to widen Europol' s remit, as decided at Tampere; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities.	49.42057241449896
We are not just calling for more control, and more control over Europol; our motto here is "Less is sometimes more!"	143.59572916456767
With most of Europol employees currently engaged in self-control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments, we may have a great deal of control, but it is inefficient control.	140.3872396883517
We want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament, without hampering the work of Europol.	77.28230671841438
At the same time, we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction.	25.045479441742177
Thirdly: the extension to Parliament' s rights in this context.	60.2837128911982
If the establishment of such an area, in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens, is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats, while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake, then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens.	58.77472244598566
There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and, as we have already said, to strengthen the principle of democratic control.	46.794127901194805
We want an area of freedom, security and justice for the citizens of Europe, not against them.	31.87434738046592
I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown.	34.6122880521414
I was also encouraged by Commissioner Patten' s comments this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crises.	49.03752171669617
Perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in Kosovo the police they promised.	183.48963908068797
I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress.	100.9791860879271
The first is asylum.	65.46200626350861
It is essential to establish a single European system, but one based on fairness, full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception conditions, including an end to routine detention.	56.726792592575976
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years.	481.7413080630875
The second area is that of freedom: freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the Union; freedom of information; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that includes not just Member State citizens but third country nationals.	116.83126839270989
Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom, not just about repression.	112.1133659404741
The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems.	134.00507778840426
Eurosceptics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty, the end of the nation-state, and so on. But the case of the suspect wanted for questioning in connection with the murders of three women in France, including British student, Isabel Peake, who was thrown off a train, shows why we need mutual recognition.	65.92835301970294
Arrested and released in Madrid, he is now being extradited after arrest in Lisbon.	76.28995824639092
Whatever the Eurosceptics say, it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters.	87.60799467862086
Finally, as has already been said, it is essential, and I hope that the IGC will cover this, to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these areas, with democratic and judicial scrutiny.	42.07607558888483
Mr President, all I can say about 1999 is this: how wonderful to feel the Portuguese summer after the Finnish winter.	89.43995146352347
I hope that it works out.	67.83590047669811
The Tampere Summit was certainly an important milestone in 1999 for Europe, and for the area of freedom, security and justice in particular.	34.10127533877128
Numerous questions are still outstanding.	78.71023525150804
Answers are still awaited.	164.2759635190962
Since Tampere, there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent.	115.27577806685835
Regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding.	64.24852891248521
On the other hand, quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life.	45.54513853216123
The creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future.	27.591808894996728
However, it is difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implemented legally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the Union.	52.71990035066211
The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force.	38.896310513347544
In Tampere, the question of granting operational powers was discussed.	133.58617569282666
We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control.	54.14492084756853
The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC.	70.49012718373531
Parliament has amended the contractual text.	122.36866191490553
Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament' s modus operandi.	35.84420504759301
Unfortunately, no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them.	159.49201014251577
Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors.	58.47114709764796
And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe.	26.389360069923278
Having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers, I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months.	26.422059473454198
Mr President, Commissioner, the oral question tabled by Mrs Terrón i Cusí shows that this House is taking a firm stance. Indeed, six months after the election of this new Parliament, we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe.	29.982061153346095
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this.	16.952195737591616
We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom, security and justice, particularly social justice.	25.119938656197213
Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems.	126.68738144476565
This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres.	45.32817675490409
For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity, we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged.	45.3484661826558
A proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism, xenophobia, nationalism and extreme-right racist movements.	96.62449229443675
We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees.	58.06881765620003
The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable.	44.901534477267255
All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect.	70.13262872489962
Last week, and somewhat by chance, I witnessed, at Roissy airport, a scene of rare violence in which two young women, admittedly illegal immigrants, were being returned to Conakry.	89.52601444928234
They were treated like the worst criminals.	119.44590809192884
They were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair, surrounded by a horde of state security police.	57.668954084745266
The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour.	18.78649258520322
Our role should be to accompany, reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships.	38.768314013574184
The Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refugees to which Parliament was favourably disposed.	74.66971503951532
Instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund, we could take the decision to set this up.	77.97085968597133
The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere, even though this summit provided an important basis.	82.94578000801461
Likewise, we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action.	181.6408045451616
The laws against racism must be harmonised.	77.46881359403105
What direction do you intend to give to Article 13 of the EC Treaty?	36.11142739391584
What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women?	21.27208599647325
How do you aim to eradicate homophobia, racism and sexism?	45.469959971652955
We must take the best from each of our countries.	38.649814258822786
When six European countries have granted the right to vote, the President of this House can venture to extend this right to vote, and eligibility to participate in the municipal and European elections, to all people from outside the Community who have lived in Europe for more than five years.	58.67735687919178
The regularisation of illegal immigrants in certain countries, including your own, must act as an example to others. These illegal immigrants nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of slum landlords, an oppressed workforce subject to economic exploitation, rendering them modern-day slaves.	95.6993119866994
In more general terms, this Presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority groups and immigrants.	79.18958348559877
Immigration is too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses.	87.98842541823781
How do you intend to make our people understand that, today like always, immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is, and will remain, essential in the context of population?	72.17844286840148
What action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seekers?	63.527480020305646
Mr President, there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security, freedom and justice.	20.562258602118245
The European Union is an economic powerhouse but we are not in a position to pontificate when it comes to our treatment of refugees.	22.753964830887696
The level of racism in our society is terrifying.	37.28239433694757
Ireland, for generations, sent her sons and daughters to places of safety throughout the world, but now when the Celtic tiger is providing wealth and prosperity beyond our expectations, we are showing a very ugly side to our character. Racism in Ireland is endemic.	137.04025770138676
It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time.	37.08892632668534
We are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up.	48.39302389926864
There is a willingness but fear pervades, and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union.	60.92693792703043
Mr President, we take note that the excuse-making, reticent Presidency, which, in recent months, has prevented us from holding a debate such as the one we have been able to hold today, has come to an end.	56.25392156187875
I totally agree with Mr von Boetticher and Mr Schulz' s remarks, and truly believe that the European Parliament and the Court of Justice need to be more involved in the area of freedom, security and justice, without having to derogate from their own powers.	29.196433578790753
Nevertheless, to avoid the customary circus, which every six months has us indiscriminately attacking the Presidency of the Council, maybe Parliament should find the courage to undertake incisive political action so that the next Intergovernmental Conference will decide to increase codecision with immediate effect and not wait for another five years.	65.0344869663236
The two identical-sounding questions which are under discussion are, of course, underpinned by a mantra of the kind which, in recent years, has increasingly transformed politics into a type of ideology - fine-sounding, but pernicious.	84.94153495744483
And our current EU mantra is AFSJ: Area for Freedom, Security and Justice.	48.90752166512175
Behind this lies another ambition on the part of the Commission and of the Council and of the overwhelming majority of this House, namely to introduce such an area.	41.05321946795663
And who is not in favour of security, freedom and justice?	41.63860526495686
The problem is just that this is not something the EU can introduce by means of legislative decrees and other supranational resolutions.	68.63091411677874
Freedom, security and justice are the root system of any society, reflecting its history, corporate experience and political development.	157.99161494809192
A system of this kind is not something the EU can introduce without society' s sustaining damage as a result.	54.76875929448218
But it is precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concerning security, freedom and justice.	64.39197378003085
The agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen.	42.04594107201944
That is already secured by means of the various national legal systems.	36.65424039616611
The agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society' s criminal law, policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU' s control.	92.17265663644515
It is concerned with increased integration which, as part of a duplicitous package, involves increased repression and control.	96.60237923397933
You just have to think of all the resolutions concerning Fort Europa, Schengen, Eurodac etc. Any democrat can spot two key problems.	230.08985045267204
First of all, the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic.	52.99974406506729
How is it envisaged that the EU' s institutions, which are already stretched well beyond their capacity, can bring the ambitious projects concerned to fruition?	108.73397311259168
Think of last year' s deadly criticism of the Commission' s lack of propriety, ethics and accountability.	35.92746198111315
It also, of course, finds indirect expression in the question.	56.58118329628975
But, secondly, the projects will put a strain on, indeed will be injurious to, the national democracies.	95.71542178724381
As long as the EU revolved around the internal market, only the body was being attacked. Now, it is the soul.	64.34719151470408
Mr President, today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony.	38.57504379617537
We had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom, security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon, which has been accepted, will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists.	61.80135000989823
The IRA terrorists have not given up any of their weapons, nor have the loyalist terrorists, yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community.	63.7971673093725
Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed.	45.270859852847
In 1998, we had 55 murders.	49.41946484534064
In 1999, we had 7 murders and that does not include the Omagh bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured.	73.0827324841078
Between 1998 and 1999, loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people, while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people.	40.08688956694239
Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193, while those against republicans totalled 97.	160.42246862194557
Since January 2000, there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans, loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults, one leading to another murder, while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults.	112.88551339453603
Mr President, that situation cannot continue and needs remedying.	85.0635373635271
Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam has set an important objective for the Union.	16.666703133028953
This is a task which all MEPs, the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature: the creation, as has been said already, of an area of freedom, security and justice.	39.43332732827268
The Tampere Council, the motor and architect of this objective, has proposed certain goals, but five years, the time scale laid down for the implementation of Chapter IV of the Treaty, is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require.	82.94827179813355
My first point is that Parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed, especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens, as the Commissioner has explained very well.	27.921652043240382
My second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system, adopting common procedural rules and, above all, putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons.	56.87597674656891
The recent laws on aliens adopted in my country, Spain, and in Belgium, are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy.	42.133827661391464
My third and final point relates to the external activities of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum.	35.562651665575096
We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants.	53.00340866761877
We must opt for a policy of cooperating in the development of our neighbouring countries in the East and the Mediterranean area, but we must do so with rigour, with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions, which must cooperate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are violated or who wish to emigrate in order to meet their most essential needs.	54.63552222017872
Finally, in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship.	29.729772106973925
The Euro, employment, even security, are not enough.	227.97488249129552
They need a 'European soul' , as a distinguished Spanish professor once said.	139.78265457081827
Mr President, unlike some of the previous speakers, I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino.	24.583634689733497
This trio's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said.	49.306387970242675
As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated.	60.22237244711584
Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months.	46.578722889659936
The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune.	69.40326882236387
As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months.	50.693669392213444
The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.	23.358516209108537
One area though is extremely important, and this House must be involved in it: namely scrutiny.	88.45925388937184
There is so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised, that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of everything involved in it.	30.679040232370454
And we must make certain that the details are applicable, appropriate and relevant to the different countries.	70.4656280667083
I should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon, one or two of which were referred to earlier on.	31.717766876820885
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime.	73.51981559296827
That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about.	63.4730378727683
But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have reservations about the Eurodac system, for example.	42.22804902613306
We accept the predominant role of the Council in this, but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail.	39.451232110400056
Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of 'scoreboard' .	62.903394696548155
Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is.	315.34622722920227
A scoreboard tells people the score; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible.	72.24500230227898
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so.	44.233560381812225
At the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening.	25.430046207632298
Mr President, I would like to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Justice Ministry, Mr Costa, and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in Lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed.	70.14563880855451
Amsterdam and Tampere have given us much work to do together, as the excellent draft resolution by Mrs Terrón today shows.	134.69747652229248
I would like to make three brief points.	17.502288237312296
The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament.	11.869267918877338
It is barely six months since Amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together; we have been sizing each other up, we have had a few minor spats, but we need to work effectively together.	93.72426428624469
Let us stop the shadow-boxing. Let us drop the elaborate charades and let us respect the duties that the Treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate.	60.43230882160922
Involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process.	304.85412210885016
Let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area.	56.023360574466714
My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission.	21.808326393025535
We have established a new Directorate-General, yet it has only 70 people all told.	137.0230074730031
There is an agreement to double this number, but I understand that, so far, not a single new person has arrived.	131.39025241654565
We are setting the Commission a massive task, not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard.	62.99990153489574
The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs.	39.46946496956094
Finally, on the content of the debate, I welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom, security and justice at the top of its agenda.	21.66211971109859
All good things come in threes, especially in our policy area.	129.46554246784555
Two hundred years ago it was liberty, equality and fraternity, and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others.	151.70615765489543
Now it is freedom, security and justice, and I hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security, important as it is, above the equally important needs of freedom and justice.	62.15786108791686
Although the main achievements in the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice should be mentioned, we must remember that there is still room for progress.	30.771561006638798
The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete.	29.41335272997421
The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this.	73.56954320041463
The decision to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic, including all people, whatever their nationality, or excluding some.	79.96727960583922
The total lack of progress in European citizenship and the political rights of all European residents is to be regretted.	47.302429639609194
Although action plans established by the high-level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future, these plans do nothing to improve human rights, civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned.	72.94938429289387
We know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements.	37.01325714736393
Yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of 'non-refoulement' [no turning back].	87.73002006886868
Furthermore, it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consulting Parliament.	88.12564500596449
However, the main concern remains ...	123.67167737617059
(The President cut the speaker off)	8.491221292876252
Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the Council as well as the Commissioner.	11.636757015150192
I thank them for their statements to the House.	55.29976978072151
Rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered I would like to deal with one specific topic: the question of drugs and how we tackle the pervasiveness of the drug culture in our societies.	61.35805132380104
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States.	36.58680207360274
We already have, on the international side, plans in place to combat drug trafficking, money laundering and so on.	64.53444645596123
But to bring it down to a more human level: to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs, and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation; secondly, to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws; thirdly, to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of "normalisation" and "harm reduction" and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people.	89.03108144481567
Mr President, I would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which I am entitled to point out, or remind, the representative of the Commission that, in Belgium, the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence, right to be reunited with their families, etc.	42.91586542373046
This is a Belgian government measure which flies in the face of the Schengen Treaty.	36.99614128852229
I lodged a written complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December.	46.715194738940966
I would ask him to take this complaint into consideration and inform me, within the foreseeable future, of the steps the Commission will take to penalise this violation of the Schengen Treaty by the Belgian State, in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty.	34.4678300365667
Mr President, esteemed gentlemen from Portugal, especially the Council representatives, you face great expectations on our part.	136.89846518604293
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment.	53.9356043534422
I refer to Eurodac.	61.42025565615491
You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system, as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications, in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and, above all, in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure.	58.55518565414207
We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument, together with an implementation committee, which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be.	51.08925492592717
We were of the opinion that EURODAC was becoming a reality.	48.994702926230616
Even in Tampere, we were of the opinion that Eurodac was becoming a reality.	70.23111715977359
However, the Council then took another direction at the very next summit in December and took a huge step backwards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected, i.e. that the Council should continue to be responsible for implementation, that the regulatory committee would be attached to the Council and that, where possible, Gibraltar would still be used to exert pressure.	65.91923689435434
This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see.	22.458069438703635
My urgent request on behalf of the Group is that you do everything to ensure that Eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures.	59.43757518367063
If you tell us today how you wish to proceed, you will be doing us a great service.	85.06134707313349
Mr President, Ministers, Commissioner, the 1999 harvest of decisions was indeed rich, so much so that it became difficult to gather, i.e. to put those decisions into practice.	92.23843130987582
I refer in particular to the Council and to the inertia of the Member States in implementing the decisions they had jointly made.	38.719015033418536
However, the past year was positively marked by some momentous decisions, such as the decision to begin implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam, the decision to incorporate the Schengen Agreement into the Community pillar, and the decision of the Cologne Council to create a Charter of Fundamental Rights and the decision of the Extraordinary European Council in Tampere to bind the Member States to common directions, priorities and goals with a view to creating a common area of freedom, security and justice.	50.924400886448815
Without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made, we, the European Parliament, would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the Council to implement these decisions in many areas, as well as its lack of common vision and, in particular, the lack of transparency and cooperation with the European Parliament.	28.42732515104243
From what I have said, it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer.	35.63649375511711
Neither will it stop raising vital issues. For example, how much progress are you willing to make and what measures, legislative or otherwise, will you be taking to combat the scourge of trafficking in human beings, child pornography on the Internet, drugs, and organised crime?	130.35048485947905
Do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration?	50.15611245327998
How do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the Community, reuniting them with their families and recognising their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of Europe?	56.959189254960016
In light of this new international demographic class portrayed by experts at the UN, is it not about time you abandoned your traditional, conservative views on refugees and immigrants?	145.15529712662982
I have great expectations for the Portuguese Presidency.	23.108425171471264
Mr President, I welcome much, indeed most, of what has been said in this debate.	31.663917518739204
But I want to add a word of caution.	26.59604269899548
We risk having not too few charters of rights in this Community, but too many: national, European Union and European Convention; not too few tribunals having the final say about our rights but possibly too many - there is the Court across the river there, there is the Court in Luxembourg.	246.26359644632578
There are also courts in Karlsruhe, London, Lisbon, Dublin and Edinburgh.	74.85066641684564
We must make sure that what we do makes clear sense.	64.54164760446615
We must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights, for that would be the enemy of freedom, justice and security.	103.56931990846691
We need, in short, to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these.	77.60479815734043
But we must look always to subsidiarity.	114.72379821750972
Like everybody in this House, I want freedom, justice and security. I do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation, chaos and confusion.	61.225364591769335
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very quickly like to make one point. Various Members raised questions about the Portuguese Presidency.	36.24184863924673
The President of Parliament has made us aware of the very limited time at our disposal, and my colleague, the Minister for Justice, and I therefore propose to reply objectively to all the questions put here at the parliamentary committee meeting which we shall be attending next week.	48.52298676682634
(Sustained applause)	99.12187890706895
Thank you, Minister.	95.29899202137211
The debate is closed.	3.77548916318001
Mr President, I am grateful for the Council' s oral, and also written, reply.	33.475887233387546
Their efficiency has been truly remarkable.	253.33537960159077
I will save a few seconds because I wanted to propose to the Council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs.	30.610930615964488
Then we will have the opportunity to comment on these replies and to express our concerns to the Commission as well.	26.804765861969607
Personally, I am pleased with some of the replies, for example, in relation to issues as sensitive as Schengen and the Europol Convention, which we hope will be reviewed, and I am pleased with the words of the Minister for Justice with regard to trying to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities.	45.4584050585374
I also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control.	21.970338812529583
Representatives of the Council, within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this Parliament.	27.63895046377383
I am sure that, with the willingness that you have shown today, the first thing you will do, in this new climate of understanding between us, will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will submit to you.	37.74452907143113
Question Time (Council)	638.5746154678101
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Council.	34.16490605291598
Question No 1 by (H-0780/99):	10.610547915950669
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.	76.43553575820314
Turkey's nuclear plans B which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region B prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	74.36041332825168
What steps will the Council take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	74.55575832624935
Mr President, the Council wishes to point out that Turkey is a signatory to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the objectives of which should allay the fears expressed by Mr Souladakis.	40.85741215794701
The aim of this convention, which came into force on 24 October 1996, is precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by means of national measures and through international cooperation.	48.35924149176863
It further aims to ensure that nuclear installations are equipped with continuing protection against potential radiological risks, so as to protect individuals, society at large and the environment against the harmful effects of the ionising radiation that can be emitted by such installations.	72.08873817373265
The convention, as you will be aware, also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur.	90.86753184214895
I would also like to remind Members that, as a candidate for membership of the European Union, Turkey will - and this is a pre-accession condition, which is an important point - sooner or later, as part of its own pre-accession strategy, have to adopt a set of policies geared towards adopting the entire acquis communautaire in good time, and including therefore all provisions already in force on nuclear safety.	66.02062250759418
Thank you for your answer.	12.860214804982686
However, I would just like to add the following.	14.962272043140386
Turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2% with this unit.	153.75733226727564
Nevertheless, rumour has it that it plans to buy Candu reactors of the type acquired by Pakistan and India which were used for nuclear weapons.	76.71962240618068
In this respect, the issue requires closer examination, because the sensitive situation in the Caucasus region could heighten people' s suspicions.	58.089256007230134
My second point concerns the safety of these plants.	34.335147190633585
In areas of high seismic risk, it is not enough just to have secure, earthquake-proof buildings. Speaking as an engineer, I can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances.	58.09418665908135
However, we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation; it is just not possible.	57.655921173768895
With this in mind, it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes.	66.7119210392436
In this respect, and because Turkey is situated on the periphery of the European Union, we should be helping it to become a more secure, peaceful and cooperative country.	50.929464069953376
That is our role and this is the point of my question.	31.427193689655354
I recognise the relevance of the arguments that Mr Souladakis has put forward.	35.129752262448754
This is, of course, a highly sensitive issue.	27.878281856462714
Furthermore, it will be evident that this is a matter that does not only affect Turkey, in view of that country' s proximity to the existing territory of the European Union. It also affects other states neighbouring the EU with which we maintain relations.	59.026625665396104
We understand your concerns and will certainly take account of them, particularly during the discussions that we will be having with Turkey to define that country' s own pre-accession strategy agenda.	84.82723067199196
This question will naturally be one of our key concerns, and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account.	38.79808817906066
Thank you, Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council.	17.342524923492018
I am sure the President-in-Office of the Council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog.	29.98222556424651
However, forgive me if I am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me.	53.88293288155551
I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately.	28.621294694622154
Will you please therefore undertake, before the next plenary in February, to write and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public, immediately the Council has passed legislation, rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list.	116.76337825736228
Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information?	103.15112880582117
Mr Newton Dunn, I would first like to say that I do not appreciate the kind of personal comments with which you started your second question, and I would be grateful if you could refrain from making such comments in future.	33.0318434029922
With regard to what you were saying, it makes me think that the criticism levelled at the Council, apart from being formulated in a very specific way of which we also take note, does not actually refer to the opacity, shall we say, of the legislative process, but rather almost to an excess of transparency.	89.64370083887889
However, I would like to say, Mr Newton Dunn, that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable.	27.742251113429468
We have no problem, Mr Newton Dunn, in repeating this information to you in writing, but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here, because that meets the requirements of the Treaty exactly.	56.511267360965356
We therefore consider that the General Secretariat of the Council is at present making available to the public all essential information regarding the Council' s functions as a legislative body.	58.971935021716
I do not consider that the Council tried to answer my question.	34.10114525297762
I did not ask what the Council thought of the proposal which the Commission has still not tabled.	37.91782340539073
Instead, my question concerns the interpretation in principle of Article 255 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	35.79129359090701
Does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the European Union referred to there?	66.9368512763059
I should like to have an answer to that question.	16.341464332163206
Does the Council consider that, on the basis of Article 255 of the Treaty, national legislation on transparency can be regulated, that is to say legislation not relating to the EU' s institutions?	51.21675002667681
Mr Sjöstedt, the answer that I gave was the only answer possible.	147.29106451118278
Nevertheless, I would like to say that any interpretation of Article 255 of the Treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity.	13.367059906634623
At the moment, there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this Article, and unless there is such a proposal, we cannot move forward on this matter.	43.821138698925004
In any event, Article 255 does not, at first sight, allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity.	44.16868619383874
I am, up to a point, concerned about how the Council will fight for the principles contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision-making process.	33.90242732150306
How is this to be done when, at the same time, the Commission' s proposal - which has been leaked, so the general public is aware of it - says that employees' freedom of thought comes before transparency and that it is not possible to have access to working documents, reports, drafts etc?	56.45643055969842
Does not the Council' s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process?	31.320146571075046
Mrs Frahm, the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last Intergovernmental Conference.	50.19367509993132
I would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the Community institutions "outwards" , it also applies between the institutions.	29.835338318856596
By this I mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the Community institutions' workings which are not accessible to the other institutions, and not only as regards the Commission' s relationship with Parliament, but also as regards the Commission' s relationship with the Council.	38.525531321511636
As a matter of fact, at the last conference, this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions.	56.18462434251597
The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference.	13.898751036637158
The matter is still open.	85.23638284907395
Genuine transparency of the institutions' workings and the way they are presented throughout Europe is an extremely important issue and one which, in my opinion, needs to be studied again, particularly in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	42.84115551352126
We have no doubts about this and we think that the Members taking part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again.	33.51519412013001
I believe that the Commission' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function, but I think that there is always room for improvement in this matter.	27.04176045761012
For our part, we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area.	39.70438252454975
It is a very important question indeed which Jonas Sjöstedt and others have asked.	40.22769784249996
We have a principle of transparency in Sweden which strengthens democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens, decision makers and authorities.	58.27216363811902
We are very anxious indeed that the EU, too, should move in this direction, and this is also stated in the Treaty of Amsterdam.	29.215561632588248
One or two years ago, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Lööw which is extremely important in this context.	27.50876341138482
The report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the Member States.	41.84192712536162
We can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament.	62.122245003953246
I want to ask the Council if it understands this warning, in view of what we have now seen in the working documents from the Commission.	36.073126233813355
I listened very carefully to what Mr Seixas da Costa had to say on transparency and the Intergovernmental Conference.	35.38176030205514
My concern is, if I have understood Mr Seixas da Costa correctly on the interesting points he made as regards transparency and the IGC, whether the Portuguese Presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of widening the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.	40.271389514437196
After all, examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other - though I know full well the importance of these lobbies.	129.89672996868262
It should have its own heading in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference, which would mean widening the agenda.	40.33183754185108
Mr Dimitrakopoulos, transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions.	114.77129161215359
This Intergovernmental Conference will, at the outset, concentrate on improving the way the institutions operate, particularly taking account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic, more transparent and more efficient.	78.76054415549454
All of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims.	103.87725214441869
It is obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the European agenda and it will, of course, feature on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference.	30.522145475167285
I can assure you that this is an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference.	23.647138209357703
It must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament, who will surely rally behind this proposal.	20.65375451365101
We will then see, at ministerial level, how we can follow this up.	73.29687638957799
It should nevertheless be noted that we have just concluded the Treaty of Amsterdam, which was approved last May, and that there is a raft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in progress.	60.10326046461261
The question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency.	42.736007749091186
My feeling is that, in spite of everything, this issue will always have to be on the agenda, because the public is clearly concerned about it, and because it is linked with the need to make the European institutions accountable to the public.	40.16580662654463
As far as we are concerned, they will be.	20.105837172950686
We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter.	14.435801717331056
Question No 5 by (H-0785/99):	8.70430216971506
Subject: Proposal for a regulation laying down the total admissible catches for specific fish populations for the year 2000, and the case of anchovies in particular The latest reports from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stocks in ICES zone VIII is critical.	50.66871729953127
Have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assessed the impact of transferring the Portuguese quota for ICES zones XI and X and CECAF zone 34.1.1 to France (5000 metric tonnes per year overfishing) on the ICES zone VIII anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future?	50.41798360541615
Does the Council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established TAC of 33 000 metric tonnes per year, given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks?	59.075310318618634
What measures does the Council intend to adopt, and when, with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks, the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability?	54.78727851246573
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency is extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question, particularly because it broaches an issue which concerns Portugal in a positive way, and I shall explain how.	52.208596423506584
The Council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay to which Mr Ortuondo Larrea refers.	29.724151751191524
Nevertheless, at the last Fisheries Council of 1999, held on 16 and 17 December, the Member States involved in this area of fishing, namely France, Spain and Portugal, considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a TAC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes, as the Commission proposed, was excessively cautious.	122.76116816429418
A compromise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risks, that is the species of fish being affected, and the socio-economic problems caused by fishing limits. This was achieved by fixing the TAC at an intermediate level of 16 000 tonnes instead of the 33 000 set in 1999.	55.55539962969279
It was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species, of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year.	43.11764146465169
As for the Southern stocks of anchovy in ICES zone IX, the TAC was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999.	65.72859064041906
Fishing quota transfers between Portugal and France were reduced proportionally from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000, for fishing in French waters.	139.02751717343978
I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall, over the whole Community fishing area.	75.4339865250747
In accordance with the principle of relative stability, 90% of stocks of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay are allocated to Spain and only 10% to France.	52.57946125050756
Without this transfer from Portuguese waters, the level of the Bay of Biscay TAC would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to France.	81.50732876968068
That is why I think that this is quite positive from Portugal' s point of view.	25.11338149137926
This situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stocks than the risk referred to by Mr Ortuondo Larrea, which we also understand.	60.00040376742217
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all.	22.97377617812488
I understand that Portugal is affected by this.	41.673117334119155
However, it seems to go against all reason and intelligence that 80% of the anchovies, which, until 1995, were being fished in the Portuguese fishing grounds, through an agreement between that Member State - Portugal - and France, should now be fished in the Bay of Biscay and that the Council of Ministers wishes to maintain that this has no effect on the anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay or the Cantabrian Sea.	51.13386767074328
It has been shown, as we have been claiming since 1995, that this move is appalling, and, if Portugal and France wish to reach an agreement, that is fine by us, but these anchovies should be fished in Portuguese fishing grounds and not in the Bay of Biscay.	75.72590470669763
Today, scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay is in danger of extinction, and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that Bay.	52.47094962539702
I do not know if you are aware, representatives of the Council of Ministers, of your responsibility over these last few years, and in 2000 as well, for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the Iberian Peninsular.	46.911508318825405
I would like to say, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, that in its judgement of 5 October 1999, the European Court of Justice ruled that this transfer, which was approved, was in accordance with the principles laid down in Council Regulation 37/60/92 and, specifically, with its Article 9(1), which stipulates that Member States may exchange all or part of the fishing rights that they have been allocated.	79.23630704710196
The Court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to Spain in zone VIII had been maintained at 90% and France' s at 10%.	132.60008047225745
Apart from this, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Court is of the opinion that the transfer effected between Portugal and France does not violate the principle of exploiting living sea and freshwater resources in a rational and responsible way, on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones VIII and IX neither increases nor adversely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to Spain.	73.93162209299032
Accordingly, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer, greater account would be taken of France' s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay.	69.18334396227364
The Council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen.	138.87181473469235
In concrete terms, 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9% in 1999.	194.4738151102959
These numbers represent, in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council, a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80% laid down in Council Regulation 685/95.	75.18143514400502
Question No 6 by (H-0788/99):	8.157579744349778
Subject: Measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Romanies in Kosovo On 2 December 1999, NATO's Defence Ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo's minority communities.	72.11758422372753
In its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against Serbs and Romanies, Parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the Serb population and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244.	217.56357610675545
The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings, abductions, detentions, intimidation, arson, looting, destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc.	83.30481348168242
In the light of the above, will the Council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as requested by Parliament?	46.20855390200134
What other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing?	85.61333232598264
Mr Alavanos, I would like to say that I have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised.	30.931043114200687
We genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in Kosovo for ethnic minorities, for both the Serb and Romany populations, and the incidents of discrimination, harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region.	59.466292609907
The Council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts.	55.7594352676151
The Council once again reiterated the need, in its December conclusions, to fully implement Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported Bernard Kouchner' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and, in particular, to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region' s multi-ethnic make-up are effectively implemented.	108.39391385049157
In our contacts with senior political figures amongst the Kosovo Albanians, we have stressed - and the Portuguese Prime Minister did this very recently - that persecution of the Serb population, the Romany population and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable.	102.67580890181875
It will not be tolerated, and must stop immediately.	34.24833671585498
It has been communicated explicitly and repeatedly to Kosovar leaders that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non-Albanian minorities are treated.	185.5780329204672
I think that this is an extremely important point: this sense of conditionality, which underlies the European Union' s position, is being maintained by the Council and will continue to be maintained.	24.635032414732585
We have fully supported the efforts of the United Nations mission and the international security forces in Kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat.	77.22900160408012
KFOR and the UNMIC police consider one of their two main tasks to be preventing any form of maltreatment on the grounds of a person' s ethnic origin.	87.6869845392265
The Council therefore expressed its satisfaction, in its December conclusions, at the substantial contributions announced by the European Commission, which will indirectly assist in returning the situation to normal, together with similar contributions made by Member States.	107.06862888363703
Nevertheless, Mr Alavanos, the Council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organisations in Kosovo does not match the desired amount, in terms of what the various Member States have been able to raise, and this has limited the real ability of these organisations to act on the ground.	48.94737002751333
We shall nevertheless continue to devote all our attention to this problem because the entire credibility of the authorities and of the organisations representing Albanians in the region also depends on the ability of these organisations to prove themselves capable of implementing measures which will guarantee the region' s multi-ethnic nature.	76.63205669050556
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council.	5.165254741114335
I believe - as I think we all do - that Portugal, its former president, Mr Soares, and its government, maintained a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombings in the Balkans.	87.02260624415183
Today' s political statement on this issue was very positive indeed, and one which I welcome.	60.37956907399555
However, there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the European Union.	53.24796627773049
Unfortunately, we have recently witnessed the eradication of Serb, Romany, Turkish, and Croatian minorities in Kosovo and we are now wondering what will happen next.	75.77394480896547
The United Nation' s, and Mr Kouchner' s, mission in Kosovo ended in failure.	102.18060513589334
This failure is illustrated by the fact that after an entire war that was waged to put an end to ethnic cleansing, we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side.	58.4541699024917
And so I would like to repeat my question as to whether the Council intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with Mr Kouchner, who has a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today.	30.72374945863928
Mr Alavanos, I cannot agree with what you just said in your last sentence on Mr Kouchner' s responsibilities, and I would like to make two very important points here. The structure being implemented in Kosovo is under the auspices of the United Nations.	37.73981389155133
It is a structure to which the European Union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the European Union have contributed in various ways.	41.26037166219279
There is one thing, however, that we cannot deny, and that is that Mr Kouchner' s efforts to return Kosovo' s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive.	100.93220200875079
This is undeniable, even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the results of these efforts, for reasons beyond Mr Kouchner' s control, have not been as effective as we would all have liked them to be.	93.97357001610598
I have one last point to make, which is about the European Union' s responsibility and, specifically, in this case, about possible action by the Council in this matter, and the responsibility of the international community, which has overall responsibility for the situation in Kosovo.	51.73770301083159
Therefore, the responsibility of the European Union has to be seen in a certain context.	21.45372775585824
It is the international community, and specifically the United Nations, which should be held responsible for implementing Resolution 12/99 and, in particular, for the thinking behind this resolution and for the compatibility of this resolution with reality.	62.14861435228067
These are questions which we should all be asking, but the forum for putting these questions is the United Nations.	96.04643127947226
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures, in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities.	21.22176373729469
I think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public.	30.188553679842688
The question which I therefore ask myself is this: has in fact a start been made on how we can promote the media in this area, how we can train journalists and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful coexistence?	70.42642703977597
We have endeavoured to provide material help.	77.28639729605052
We have tried to defend peace by taking military action.	50.39615894988088
What is the situation now as regards efforts to include psychological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here?	112.84509579826924
Mr Rübig, as I said, I understand your concerns very well.	38.03670870700687
I think that, at the moment, particularly in the last few months, there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to Mr Kouchner, in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently.	26.09737826974016
I heard Mr Kouchner speak at the Council of Europe ministerial meeting on this issue, and I think that many of the concerns he expressed then about the lack of resources needed to overcome some of the problems have now been addressed. In other words, he has been given these resources.	48.49350690142446
There are two fundamental questions in particular.	39.4346529814946
Firstly, an increase in police numbers would be an important factor in guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population and, in particular, in protecting certain sections of the civilian population. Secondly, an increase in appropriations would allow some officials who have important roles in the administrative and operational process in Kosovo to be kept on.	77.1027560714536
The issue which we should all raise, and I did so myself, in a diplomatic way, a while ago, concerns the very substance of Security Council Resolution 12/99.	158.87346723032877
I know that this is an extremely delicate issue, but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented.	45.09470954052859
We advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety.	28.321061678194344
Nevertheless, we must look at this resolution, and this is also something that the United Nations Security Council will probably have to do sooner or later. We will have to do so because, as has happened in the past in other contexts and in other strategically important situations across the world, we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of process, and a certain kind of logic and balance - which were in fact the logic and the balance which led to this resolution being approved - should be maintained in future.	44.66621782506206
What we have to do, and we in the European Union are already doing it, is to guarantee Mr Kouchner all the necessary resources, and you are right, Mr Rübig, we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used.	55.70681553375884
We in the Council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency.	25.072245191794135
Mr Seixas da Costa, I totally agree with you.	29.88349861485264
The problem is not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working, namely Resolution 1244.	85.26121987436518
Having said this, the EU' s responsibility, which is both yours and ours, is to try and move beyond the provisional nature of Resolution 1244 and devise a future scenario for the whole region.	86.18028183039992
It is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses, accidents and assassinations mentioned by Mr Alavanos.	104.81974741673297
Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo?	37.97520044166849
If so, does it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region, avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-States, as has tended to happen elsewhere, and reuniting the parties, in this case Kosovo and Albania?	62.77562733268635
Question No 8 by (H-0796/99):	10.666302895081738
Subject: New INTERREG Initiative In point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft Communication on INTERREG entitled: Promotion of urban, rural and coastal development, the Commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy.	249.09638467146706
However, housing is specifically excluded.	293.97088728442543
Given the fact that there are many houses in rural areas which are of historic interest, including small cottages, and, given the need, for a variety of reasons, to maintain rural populations and to attract people to rural areas, does not the Council agree that these objectives could be assisted if housing projects were funded in the areas covered by INTERREG?	72.25316720070688
Mr President, the Council and, I think, the Portuguese Presidency in particular, are extremely aware of the importance of the problems Mr Gallagher' s question raises and I would like to say that we have always paid the utmost attention to Community policies for the development of rural areas.	29.981718037849323
I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development.	45.559137685670436
This was, as you know, one of the changes made during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at Community level.	65.50600257791882
Through the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund, the EAGGF, this Community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of abandoning rural areas, an issue you are quite right to raise.	173.19456356664847
On the other hand, the European Regional Development Fund, the ERDF, also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion, by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion.	49.91407942895616
In this regard, we should bear in mind that the ERDF also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas.	30.8264282807123
This combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today, furthermore, is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy - in one of its dimensions - and regional policy also, have developed and changed.	59.833722515448606
We think that this is one of the most fundamental issues within the concept of multifunctionality which is now associated with changes in the common agricultural policy, and the EAGGF, of course, has a crucial role to play in this.	30.350809831366
Question No 9 by (H-0798/99):	10.535878115891217
Subject: Farming and the Portuguese Presidency Will the Council outline the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency for the next six months as regards the common agricultural policy and indicate the steps it feels are necessary to boost consumer confidence in the agricultural sectors and products adversely affected by recent health scares?	54.5494873543325
Your question on the common agricultural policy is one which we take very seriously and which should always be considered in this House' s discussions, because in the future we are likely to discuss this issue at great length.	42.10477608680581
During the Portuguese Presidency, we will be continuing discussions on the CAP, by adapting some of the common market organisations with a view to developing the Union' s rural areas in an appropriate way and guaranteeing an improvement in farmers' incomes, paying particular attention to measures which could have an impact on small family-run farms.	90.88044480624266
On the other hand, the Portuguese Presidency will continue, if and when the new WTO round begins within its term of office, which is by no means guaranteed, to ensure that the presence of Community production on international markets is strengthened. It will also continue to ensure a greater balance between exported Community farm products and preserving the multifunctional European agriculture to which I have just referred.	94.56273506156693
The Portuguese Presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President-in-Office already referred to this aspect this morning.	48.05232932108783
We think that the role of food safety, specifically in terms of everything linked to public health, is one of our presidency' s essential tasks. It is therefore one of the priorities of our programme.	41.96502080943536
We shall be developing it in four parallel schemes, in the Agriculture Council, the Health Council, the Consumer Affairs Council and the Internal Market Council.	133.10021144206866
At the Santa Maria da Feira European Council meeting in June, the Portuguese Presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the Commission presented in its White Paper a few days ago.	36.27808003732801
We think that the task we now have of establishing a European agency is crucial in order to give credibility to the single market, to stabilise confidence in this market, to break down some of the tensions between Member States in this area and even - it has to be said - to give the European Union a common approach for its dealings with third countries in areas of food safety.	53.22279743916778
This is what we shall be trying to achieve during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope, at the end of it, to be able to present the result of our efforts to this House.	25.219584113923435
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.	14.796928455211098
I am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat to the European model which is based on family farming, mainly those farmers involved in beef and sheepmeat production who are now expected to sell their produce at or below production costs.	89.77177210761958
I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks, in particular, against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where, of course, European standards of food safety do not apply.	141.96130001072112
I completely understand your concerns, and I feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the European Union itself on this issue.	31.550436957784427
We also have to think of the consequences, especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers.	37.16938467264196
Nevertheless, as you know, this issue is now in the hands of the European Commission and it will have to take this further.	28.520928501474096
The Council' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited.	43.09991202996099
Mr President, I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber.	12.220192009763107
But I do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisations actively involved in this field.	49.22300584061086
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency.	84.45789032750037
My specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level.	63.265810583534304
I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role, even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States.	75.58427367879644
Mr Crowley, with regard to the presidency' s scope for supporting actions by non-governmental organisations, particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless, I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome, and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them.	36.84471182426187
We have worked closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency, which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme.	64.43958332488558
We have no specific, concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by NGOs in this area might be considered during our presidency.	63.69588548465351
It should be pointed out that this can only be done within the Council' s scope for action.	18.516744348892626
Any aspect of this which may impinge on the Commission' s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the Commission itself.	48.638940163233144
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have talked a lot about the future, about what the Commission will do, and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon, etc. However, you also said something which I find particularly frightening.	51.00267538637443
You said that in Lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development.	59.57110260625748
I am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead, partially at least, to exclusion.	93.90848350524601
I do not see how you could, with the views that you hold, provide any answers.	94.53856936003022
What I asked and what I am once again asking is the following: what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on, for example, the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion, the division of work and social security, the implementation of tax policies, particularly for speculative capital, and the policy of redistributing wealth?	66.33229456224518
I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intends to do something about these matters.	21.175861594434355
You must understand that a presidency' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited.	127.00965113779358
I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission' s own scope for intervening, through its right of initiative.	31.056457297518534
I have spoken about the Special European Council and about Portugal' s initiative in convening it, and I have spoken about the future, because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion.	57.32326323821272
One of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion. The second is to create internationally competitive conditions, which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the European Union, and this will have positive knock-on effects on the problems of social exclusion.	37.4635872784796
The Portuguese Presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can, in six months, resolve problems that have always existed.	42.40639576328735
It is prepared to act on proposals by the Commission in any area for which there is Community competence.	50.03878499825918
It also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented, specifically by non-governmental organisations, but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters.	44.66447138119105
We should, however, also bear in mind, Mr Papayannakis, that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact, armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months.	69.29212877825653
We therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long-term strategies, regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term, some of the homeless may be dead, will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the European Union.	31.010250999440522
We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency.	69.08036245712256
Question No 12 by (H-0801/99):	10.25506676601021
Subject: Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy, the Convention of Lomé and tackling famine situations?	50.640903858771395
I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question, and indeed the Minister who spoke to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outlining the position.	35.10194795162322
But there are some questions still outstanding.	51.926628102987706
There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme.	36.18612425150532
The situation of AIDS in Africa now is so serious that more people are dying of AIDS than are dying in conflict.	72.15442354604734
I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue.	52.13843970679068
Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa.	46.353974997458266
I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia where there is drought, where the crops have failed, and where, in six months' time, we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in Ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands.	66.50220516060553
At the same time, there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armaments industry in Europe is not short in sending guns, after which we will send the bread.	41.89368411400443
First of all, Mr Andrews, you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague' s speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development. There is no contradiction between our two positions, quite the opposite.	29.453731437523423
Unless we wish to act like megalomaniacs, we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face, particularly in the area of external relations.	76.26533439170154
As you can understand, it would be easy to do so.	17.810605968612066
All we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme, one after the other.	123.43066114408167
We are sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within governments' ability to act and within the scope of the Council.	66.53595392994507
We must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve, particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes.	42.808350088825875
You have mentioned Ethiopia, which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes, but there are, as you know, several Community actions to combat AIDS, and in this respect, you are right, and the United States will probably not do any better.	91.55646195411786
Indeed, in terms of development aid policy, I think that Europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compares very favourably with that of the United States.	62.076998775711374
Your question switched to the subject of arms, a broader policy issue which I do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the Council will, of course, address in the future, if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context.	57.808017419474616
Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the EU to developing countries at prices below the cost of production?	79.16032447688737
Does the presidency intend to do anything about this?	31.77866239331967
Since the author is not present, Question No 13 lapses.	80.91087311995456
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, and I would personally like to welcome him and the Portuguese Presidency.	10.776213704625004
Please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on European affairs.	115.05490954096895
Unfortunately, in my case, he did not provide what I would call a satisfactory answer.	109.27906903524271
Since the Council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset, it should, in my view, demonstrate this in practice.	58.38486269943297
Saying that the cultural dimension is governed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is, I am afraid, just an excuse.	61.98166925063395
My question, which has not been answered, is why, when the European Parliament is looking to increase appropriations to fund cultural programmes within the European Union, the Council and the Commission are cutting back on appropriations and at times cutting them out altogether.	67.77068859194506
This is a true example of the Council' s indifference towards culture, despite its assurances to the contrary that it is a matter to which it attaches great importance.	46.75446073474297
I would therefore like to ask the Council if it is prepared henceforth to support culture with the same readiness as it supported bananas, hops, cows and Indian hemp.	23.458114178815357
Mr Marinos, we are not adopting a purely economic approach to managing the Portuguese Presidency, and therefore, the cultural dimension is, I am sure you will appreciate, one of our main concerns.	59.945811322812496
These cultural dimensions, however, almost always have their own economic dimension in turn, that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives.	95.97263245242125
This is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the European Union, and especially within the framework of the Council.	22.894982632839977
For our part, we shall be attempting to strengthen and consolidate the European position on cultural goods and services and on activities in this sphere, because we believe that this is an identifying feature which is crucial to the Union' s image and to the Union' s own particular identity.	53.2089805811607
This is, and will continue to be, connected with developments within the World Trade Organisation.	39.818520065572486
As you know, both we and the Council have addressed this issue appropriately.	84.94667902977955
In specific terms, we have been able to find a common language in terms of the mandate given to the Commission for the next round of WTO negotiations, at which this will be a central issue.	39.422432335340766
Nevertheless, I would like to add that with regard to cultural policy, and in particular the audiovisual dimension, the Portuguese Presidency will be paying very close attention to extending and enriching European audiovisual policy by adopting a Media-Plus programme which could go some way towards allaying Europe' s main fears.	65.73388762385532
We also intend to initiate a new debate, a more innovative one, on the issue of Europe' s film heritage, given that this must be one of the most important factors in the development of a European cultural identity and of a European audiovisual economy.	34.026647077600025
The Presidency will also concentrate on discussions about creating a digital television system in Europe, which will be the subject of a conference that we shall be organising during the Portuguese Presidency, in conjunction with the Commission, in February 2000.	37.98226321316527
But, Mr Marinos, in the EU context, culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with IGC agendas.	93.11674306742376
If, by chance, it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, then this could be suggested, both by Member States, and by the Members of the European Parliament taking part in the preparatory group.	47.9268835390721
Of course, if consensus could be reached on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference, there might eventually be progress.	50.68856922486025
It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this.	31.663675943141588
We will soon see, and for our part, we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue.	41.51948812814475
Mr President, I join others in wishing Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency.	200.27715204851117
I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it, you would consider it.	76.0922101392131
Well, I, and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it.	206.81699420271747
I appreciate that it is a provocative question.	20.21419033381518
It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves.	45.495822830680076
We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens.	80.70272507567182
I cannot think of a better way to do it.	44.4983609690859
Can you?	220.38409576736447
The issue is whether the European dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the Treaties.	44.129361256559044
This is an issue which, as you will understand, will have to be addressed at IGC level and is an issue that only a Special European Council can authorise the Portuguese Presidency to pursue, because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take place.	60.216887890271956
Intergovernmental Conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree.	62.33012514195312
It is therefore not out of the question that these issues, which crop up again and again, and which are passed from one conference to another, may be addressed.	72.59845064517238
The problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the European Union on this issue being included, particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included, other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference' s agenda.	58.56889661170019
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion.	35.619275708703206
I would ask him to be brief.	14.648568578790526
Mr President, I understand that I have to do this very quickly.	17.272260612828177
I liked what Mr Seixas da Costa said about Father Christmas.	40.92489618030593
In Spain they say a letter to the three kings.	54.97790102432326
I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports.	27.099156749861944
Now the Presidency and the Council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings.	62.218562104834476
As I suspected, it was not exactly a procedural motion, but more a closing of the debate.	58.626875529621735
We thank Mr Seixas da Costa, but he can also write his letter to the three kings.	39.101770060394124
I would merely say that the festive issue which Mr Dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one.	35.28977943524542
The problem is that in this case Father Christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so.	85.87623101631584
It is not the Portuguese Presidency' s job to hand out the presents that everyone wants, especially those that the European Parliament is asking for.	58.32837469727207
After this interesting exchange of opinions, and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I would like to tell you that Questions Nos 17 to 27 will be replied to in writing.	35.597711804089435
That concludes questions to the Council.	35.7375229733875
Capital tax	3330.8090023974273
The next item is the joint debate on:	8.673499649839501
the oral question (B5-0004/2000) by Mr Désir and others, to the Council, on the Council position on the idea of a capital tax	27.30108619812017
the oral question (B5-0005/2000) by Mr Désir and others, to the Commission, on the Commission position on the idea of a capital tax.	24.22855047979518
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, during the Asian crisis in 1997, as with those which hit Mexico in 1995 or the EMS in 1993, everyone could see the damage caused to the economies of entire countries by financial speculation, particularly currency speculation.	73.4753417424875
Between EUR 1 500 and 2 000 billion are traded every day on the financial markets. In three or four days, this can equal the total figure of annual global production, or global GDP, of approximately EUR 6 000 billion.	121.30371053798173
The bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments.	94.26780463695584
Yet the erratic movement of these massive sums of capital can, in a few hours, cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country, plunging its whole population into recession.	106.00628678458152
In view of this situation, renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by James Tobin, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, to create a tax on currency transactions. The rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments, but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation, thereby checking the multiplication of short-term transactions.	60.998826464532726
Note that this proposed tax, which seems to be producing strong emotions in some people, would be the lowest tax in the world and the lowest in the history of global taxation. Yet it would represent the recapture of the areas seized from democracy by the financial sphere.	86.71959460964004
One reason for the acceptance of this proposal, and of the campaigns by NGOs such as ATTAC, SOLIDAR or others which have popularised this proposal, is that it would release resources which could be allocated to development programmes in the poorest countries, in areas such as education or health.	57.09096005116633
It could act as a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there is both increasing wealth and increasing poverty.	54.66423934093792
Many personalities and institutions have come out in favour of this tax such as the Brazilian President, Fernando Cardoso, the Finnish Government, the Canadian Parliament last March and also Lionel Jospin in 1995.	71.47577884876031
This question has been debated in several national parliaments of the EU.	40.798442769562705
The common response has been that this tax could not be applied solely at national level and that the right platform for tackling this is the European Union. This is the reason for the oral question to the Council and Commission which we have tabled with 37 other Members.	50.55328822177583
I am delighted with the compromise motion for a resolution which we have reached with the GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA, ELDR and PSE Groups.	29.36303768884962
This motion asks the Commission to present a report to Parliament within six months on the feasibility of this tax. It also asks for an examination of the pressures and financial sanctions which could be applied against countries which encourage tax evasion or which maintain tax havens.	90.68473751574237
One of the most common objections is that such a tax would be too complex, but this could be said of any tax. If this argument had been accepted in the past, then no taxes would ever have been created.	76.1017533226204
The motion also asks that a position document, drawn up by the Commission and Council, should be submitted before the next annual meeting of the IMF.	53.673579849203946
The European Union must take the initiative and must also, as demanded in the motion, propose this initiative to the G7 because it is primarily a political question.	54.10178273562887
If the Union takes the initiative, this will have a ratchet effect because this debate is occurring all over the world, including in the USA and Japan. A desire is being expressed everywhere with increasing force that the world should not be ruled by traders but by the people, their parliaments, their governments and their democratic institutions.	76.22047176863639
Europe must play a role in this new international regulation and I am extremely happy that today, with this debate and this motion, this question is now on the agenda of European construction.	53.24331999902101
Madam President, I do not have a great deal to add on this subject.	13.0960097774915
The Council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as Professor Tobin suggested.	90.59773342972603
This is a creative initiative, which we know has been welcomed by different industries across the world and by various sides in European politics, but the Commission has not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue.	89.03536933418306
As it falls to the Commission to propose any such initiative, the Council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue.	30.791368624462965
Madam President, the revenue basis of the Tobin tax is said to be made up of very short-term exchange transactions.	72.92163116175978
Such transactions, according to the argument, bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables. This has also just been underlined by Mr Désir.	149.0075311143967
Therefore, according to proponents, such as Mr Désir, an internationally applied Tobin tax would, in principle, reduce speculative transactions and, hence, the volatility of exchange rates, which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity.	130.50391382584542
Taking into account the considerable volume of short-term financial streams, even a low nominal Tobin tax would yield respectable sums of tax revenue.	107.14998928153112
In reality, the motive underlying the increased interest in the Tobin tax and other sources of international finance in the mid-nineties was non-economic.	114.51916702389526
Indeed, it was fuelled by the potential of this tax to generate income for international, public programmes at a time when demand for such funds was rising quickly and funding was increasingly harder to come by.	158.5504661126437
The Commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax, such as the Tobin tax, as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation, so to speak.	126.97241040208925
Mr Désir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides.	92.81083175626333
But if the Tobin tax were to be applied unilaterally in order to prevent attacks on a specific currency, then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market.	62.809551436443385
Put more strongly, in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds, the Tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off-shore tax havens.	112.51637368074148
In that case, the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity.	43.23913743061757
So the Tobin tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industrialised countries which are prepared to participate.	37.62633271822688
Finally, even if the Tobin tax is designed to curb speculations with currencies, there is still the risk that even non-speculative streams would be affected, and that is not the intention.	50.531489329783724
For the reasons set out above, I cannot see a good reason for introducing a European Tobin tax.	87.68230167407147
At any rate, the Commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the European Union.	52.32073172213283
In more direct terms, to the extent that this measure could be deemed an indirect restriction on capital streams, this would contravene the Treaty of Rome.	61.245103274411484
The correct speculative approach, it seems to me, is to remove the real causes which lead to financial chaos, rather than attempting to suppress its symptoms by introducing obstacles to the operation of the markets.	74.50749575587531
Madam President, Commissioner, I should like once again to say a few words on the modus operandi and the ideological tactics behind this oral question.	17.162474356720104
Also because I know how many social democrats in this House share our criticism, and not just the economic and financial policy experts.	115.86781196748454
We know what the problem is: instability on the markets as the result of speculation.	61.405555110674534
But the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability, as the Commissioner has just so impressively told us, is the result of speculation.	104.48978719057924
The Tobin tax would not have been able to prevent the crises in the EEA in 1992 and 1993 or the crises in the south-east Asian currencies in 1997.	42.272038666561905
The initiators of this question do not propose a solution; instead they are calling for a new burden, they are calling for more bureaucracy, for a measure which runs counter to the market mechanisms and they are taking up plenary' s time with an intergroup opinion which excludes the competent parliamentary committee, contrary to several resolutions by Parliament.	79.93216832416374
In my view, and I say this quite clearly, the question is ideologically motivated rather than solution-focused.	61.91308014057029
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons.	41.27515968212209
Why do we reject the Tobin tax and consider it so questionable?	70.87333704434036
First, and the Commissioner has also confirmed this, because it places a heavy burden on the capital markets.	75.31225538437396
Even a small tax would have serious repercussions on the capital markets, because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investments considerably.	151.0241627498225
In addition, this sort of measure would also seriously hamper the development of the financial markets and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital, which is one of the central tenets of the internal market.	25.742521295015816
Secondly, speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify.	130.46527526620787
Thirdly, unless they are introduced in all countries at the same time, tax measures are easy to circumvent because there are otherwise too many loopholes.	74.62764143905954
Fourthly, technically speaking, this measure is highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control.	94.78475295041878
The measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today.	70.29081957433229
We need stronger banking supervision.	72.129483572307
We need to clarify the liability for transactions.	64.053001181194
We need a framework of regulations at international level.	30.913187145543322
We need to examine national laws in order to check that they comply with the rules of the Basle committee and how the dissemination of these rules can be stepped up.	39.7460843627546
I have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands.	33.814155177875676
I refer to point 9.	99.72120758882235
Having listened to the Commissioner just now, we know that the Commission' s knowledge of the facts will result in a 'no' to the Tobin tax.	54.25053023369874
If the knowledge of the facts and this debate and the arguments are as we say, and I think that they are right, then to take up another six months of the Commission' s time and occasion uncertainty on the financial and capital markets would be irresponsible.	76.50383205166848
The capital markets do not want uncertainty from us, they want clarity; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote.	172.1437243891887
Madam President, the debate on a tax on short-term financial actions is not a new one.	42.169051810064566
We have been discussing the Tobin tax proposal for twenty years and yet the question is still topical because we need really concrete and honest answers based on careful studies.	98.16791772974496
We need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transactions really is.	120.72010379090682
This question has now entered a different dimension, a dimension in which USD 1 500 billion roam the world twenty-four hours a day looking for attractive investments, no more than 3% of which have anything to do with the real economy.	103.32096116650742
We are concerned about stability on the financial markets, not for the sake of the financial markets, but because this has to do with own growth, our own investments and our own jobs in the European Union.	44.07743784761367
We must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past.	50.00559433093294
We have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions, but so far we have had no working set of rules, as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the Asian and Latin American crises.	60.38996359980665
It is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information.	74.31227721158055
It is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is.	85.38771223943303
We must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice.	31.553942502542064
At a time when the tax burden on the work factor is increasing throughout Europe and internationally, we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that includes the question of how to tax short-term financial transactions.	75.424634975559
I think that we really do need a careful report and conclusions from the Commission, so that we as the European Parliament can see if we need to ensure that the European Union achieves real international solidarity with the USA and Japan in making the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure.	43.46512219947155
This is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward-looking proposal.	169.91774458448543
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must express my surprise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible taxation which, although it does not mention it in the text, appears to be an attempt to revive, as the introduction has done, the issue of the tax proposed some years ago by Mr Tobin, which our Group opposed, clearly and totally, during the last legislature, with a series of arguments clearly and coherently expressed by our President, Mr Cox.	53.64274847120458
I will have to repeat these arguments, modestly, in this intervention, because the same issue has arisen once again.	71.73612945707478
We do not agree with this type of tax because its application, in the event that it could happen, would not achieve the aims which Mr Tobin presented at the time and which the Left in this House wishes to revive.	67.82558267115976
Firstly, there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets.	48.448633389172706
On the contrary, since it is certain that not all countries would accept it, we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility, instability, insecurity, opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services operating on an international level.	95.19798235890698
Furthermore, the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity, when we consider their application in practice, that it appears simply impossible.	150.36853487079446
This is a false debate whose aim is purely political, and has no basis or technical viability.	101.17607309770641
Furthermore - since we are in this European Parliament - if we have still not managed the slightest agreement with regard to the package of fiscal measures proposed by the Commission within the European Union, how can we expect to achieve a fiscal agreement on an international level?	47.06100417335606
I suppose that the first thing they say will be, 'let us see whether you are capable of reaching a fiscal agreement within the Union' .	60.41433008136552
However, the Liberal Group has not wanted to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and, therefore, we have accepted a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carried out on the possibility and suitability of imposing this tax on certain areas of international capital movements.	49.70427645672044
I am sure that this study - if carried out objectively, with knowledge of the financial markets and their mechanisms on an international level - will show that it is neither suitable nor possible, not only in terms of its application, but also as a means of achieving the proposed objectives.	61.153938081214534
In itself, globalisation is positive.	194.99288038042394
The economy has never grown so much nor favoured so many countries on a global level.	128.85735243826716
This is due to progressive opening up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital.	81.7190717303583
Any analysis of economic development in recent years, if objective, will show, through the figures, that they have no political colour or orientation.	70.41783058851539
As I have said, we are not opposed to such a study.	19.099582956797377
We will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study, but we simply insist that, as this motion for a resolution points out, it is by means of liberalisation and opening up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress, both on the level of states and on a general level.	60.627103779367175
Madam President, Commissioner, the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature.	39.97585215287164
As Mrs Randzio-Plath said, we must remember that the reason why certain Members want to revive this question is because of the recent international financial crises and their economic, social and environmental consequences which have been felt by all in some countries.	41.91094733587594
The main objective of this debate is to look at the instruments available to the international community for stabilising the international financial and monetary system.	34.587540266083906
In this respect, Mr Bolkestein, the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the Tobin tax.	25.486816677921226
If you look carefully, this proposed tax on capital is just one of several instruments aimed at forcing international investors to behave responsibly on the financial markets.	83.77582278618574
Secondly, the motion does not say that we want a solely European initiative.	80.05296854087699
This is why we explicitly refer to the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund so that the European Union, in other words the Commission and also the Council, can decide how it will defend the opportunity to stabilise the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation.	40.313667661668866
There should be no confusion in this debate. As environmentalists, we do not want an excuse for a motion.	31.790908575930125
Although a study produced by the Commission would doubtless be interesting, we do not need another to add to those already available.	100.9278224353528
We do need to obtain, from the Commission and the Council, in other words from each of the governments forming the Union, a clear, positive or negative, political stance. They must indicate whether they are ready to defend, within competent public bodies such as the International Monetary Fund in the first instance, the appropriateness of such a tax within the other instruments needed to stabilise the international monetary system.	71.26862062903554
As for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty, very short-term capital movements are specifically intended to play on uncertainty and to bet on changes between currencies or various short-term financial assets.	149.94115827904537
This argument is therefore not relevant.	57.41777956636276
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments.	118.19355868052169
However, I would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion, but also paragraph 10.	78.23143842943993
We clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund. We therefore demand, if this motion is adopted tomorrow, that the Commission and Council appear before Parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion.	68.13904961698026
Madam President, my Group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today, particularly as we have spared no effort along with Members of other groups to bring this about.	54.49980254879982
Obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning.	75.90177854612595
Having said this, our Group is pleased about the step forward which the compromise motion represents. This invites the Commission to present a report within six months.	66.25282513156156
The European Parliament can play its role by taking the initiative, even if it does so timidly, on this subject. However, I agree with the previous speaker that, if paragraph 9 were challenged, this motion would clearly lose its substance.	74.97533373229156
This debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitimately raising. What are the respective places of people and finance in today' s economy?	120.980861342794
USD 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world' s currency markets. This represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services.	105.45659496287438
By putting finance at the helm, this has reinforced the demands of profitability and toughened the operating conditions everywhere.	119.55360392111324
It has led to a growth in mergers, acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets.	78.28188923407215
Unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing.	290.0641540699967
Openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries, to the point of collapse, as in Asia, Russia and Brazil.	93.05473479502471
Faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets, demand, as our motion recognises, is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world.	126.21814779593954
No one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information.	92.47108489389284
In this respect, all ideas deserve to be considered, including the Tobin tax which is important, just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged.	64.26096836745383
This tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy. It could release new resources for investment in people and, at a time when the UNDP estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be USD 40 billion per year, it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs.	95.84604315012301
When the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators.	83.36521407038289
The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this.	23.049186192714757
I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and, like Mr Désir and several other speakers, I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect.	32.26787708711613
In any case, the European Parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone.	43.19485198373586
Madam President, I too am delighted that we are having this debate. I only regret that it has been so long in coming.	35.0878825544201
We know that each generation has, over the course of time, blindly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology. This is a set of prejudices accepted as such due to a general conformism, but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations.	108.96884041095745
Free trade and the constant worship of globalisation are now the dominant ideology or, rather, the big mistake of our fin de siècle. This ideology is as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin or, before that, the certainty, elevated to the status of a dogma, that the earth was flat.	86.10260817514586
Our world is now dominated by a single logic or, I could say, a single god of money at work instead of people at work.	133.73218950435782
With a figure for trade in goods and services of FRF 36 000 billion only being equal to the product of four days' speculation, the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individuals.	165.34632938897127
It is self-perpetuating in a world of ever higher bids which constantly denies the humanity of man, the rich as much as the poor. Yet it is the latter who, at the end of the day, are excluded from the majority of the world' s decision-making centres for these are monopolised by a tiny minority referred to recently, and very aptly, by Jean-Pierre Chevènement as the globalised élites.	61.351819729116485
It was natural that these élites would exclude any political concerns from their field of manoeuvre, thus protecting themselves from any democratic control and basically managing to be both illegitimate and irresponsible.	192.05631919236203
However, the people are fighting back, as demonstrated by their reaction during the incredible Seattle Summit. The leaders of the world, headed unfortunately by the European Commission, rushed forward submissively, hoping that their docility at the feet of the master of the world, Mr Clinton, would be enough to ensure them the scraps from the table.	75.07253221737066
Yet they reckoned without the salutary reaction of the nobodies, both individuals and States. This reaction was more organised than previously, due in France particularly to the magnificent ATTAC network which is fighting with increasing support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transactions in particular.	142.50203894373064
The creation of this taxation, of either the Tobin type or the more realistic type proposed by Professor Lauré, could prove to be politically opportune, at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate. This is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a foothold in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of States.	91.93146011307846
Madam President, although some of the aims of the Tobin tax are fairly worthy of support, introducing the tax exclusively within the territory of the European Union, as the first area of the world to do so, would sound the death knell for the European currency markets.	59.47341032607667
If the world' s other important currency trading areas were to be excluded from the Tobin tax, the fact that tax was liable to be paid in Europe would lead to currency dealing moving to those areas.	107.77133879825865
This has already been made clear a number times in this debate.	32.51228206217639
It is not enough that all the world' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme, as then currency trading would move to tax havens outside that group of countries.	110.88009183827224
There should therefore be a universal application: it is not enough that the G7 countries or the other industrialised countries are involved.	51.7616265505232
On the other hand, it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speaking, I do not believe we can achieve this - that the Tobin tax dream might as well be buried.	55.71345669949822
Furthermore, although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme, the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed.	109.11499900623767
The world' s currency dealing centres will hardly agree to the tax revenue being used, for example, for a variety of well-meaning, UN-backed purposes throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remaining with them.	181.0928522029011
With regard to the Tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises, it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be averted through taxation.	65.05840073492213
For that reason, as Mr Karas also said, we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value.	49.6557134619747
This again would require measures to regulate the exportation and importation of capital; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way.	38.304190813288564
Although it seems a reasonable scheme, the Tobin tax is not without its problems, even if there should be agreement as to its implementation, which I do not believe there will.	80.40024714001945
It has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information, and that the global economy will, in the future, rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital.	51.69393147203822
For that reason, the uninterrupted flow of assets in massive volumes between the world' s financial centres is not merely speculative activity, which has nothing to do with the real economy.	65.04053436516291
If this 'feedback' mechanism, which gives users the opportunity to make choices, were hampered by measures such as the Tobin tax, mistaken decisions might be made that turned out to be so costly in terms of the economic consequences that the tax would never be able to make up for it.	65.3148384743836
Hence, as Mr Karas has stated to his credit, our Group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the Tobin tax.	58.54658652881222
Madam President, I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders.	109.47642491706135
It seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary.	46.49414458138365
In the last 30 years, the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times: firstly, total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading; secondly, annual global trade in real goods and services equals just three-and-a-half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350, that is, 1% of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99% are for speculation.	208.17655372462542
The size, unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies.	68.40586879051718
Computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche, burying jobs, lives and industries across the globe.	93.07710094797
The only arguments against it are: firstly, it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzies we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world, in East Asia, Europe and Latin America.	81.44411876109886
Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy.	43.34727997625553
What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators, stockbrokers and option traders.	45.15101758048662
Of course, this cannot be done in one country; it cannot be done within the single currency area, but it could be done at international level with global cooperation.	37.54831378618356
Europe, Japan and the US - the euro, the yen and the dollar, would constitute, in my opinion, such a block.	81.18270968510693
I am disappointed in the EPP.	19.048767682329242
I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on.	82.47212250023526
Yes, I am in favour of such a tax, but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow.	22.479486619661223
What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to study the matter, to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax.	40.02862189616149
Equally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax, but I cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue.	48.28752208458826
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind.	175.14841118526226
The tax has the support of 47% of the people in the UK, according to a recent survey by War on Want.	140.8980628891433
In France it has had enormous resonance, particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty.	97.86682967085738
This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament, the Council or the Commission.	24.451708630821077
There is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than: "It has not been done before".	46.77054881365275
In the new millennium, with new global problems requiring new global solutions, they need to give good arguments why it cannot be done now, rather than why it has not been done in the past.	72.05825436033437
Madam President, Commissioner, a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules.	54.3992846330051
I have two or three points to make in this respect.	31.25846770667877
One of the main demands of the demonstrators in Seattle was, rightly, the establishment of this type of tax, and this is not by chance.	33.11826281866414
The proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich European countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism.	46.15627488738288
Everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtuous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its perverse effects. The Members on the right should note this.	142.70902974379158
It symbolises the need for solidarity with the countries of the south, particularly those in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in Seattle.	40.51274134106916
In order to fully achieve its objective, the money supply released by such a tax must be redistributed among the poorest countries.	58.12286475341368
This is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south.	54.44552864526348
Madam President, we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted; we must also mention the fact, Commissioner, that 80% of these huge, daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days.	131.70809267467862
We cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares.	75.03992789278907
We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action.	24.62478537722564
We cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly.	79.59958784000199
It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6% of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea.	257.7328934254318
We cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations.	54.69933535841594
Nor do I believe that this is impracticable.	30.394475479747186
Why should it not be possible for the G7 countries, the other EU Member States, China, Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax?	36.005890032206345
There must be an overriding economic interest.	40.20192541161422
Why should it be impracticable, and it can be differentiated, to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions, all the so-called cash transactions, currency futures and options?	100.7950816671675
Why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive.	88.05843611597429
Numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise, but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St. Florian principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold.	123.979476906801
Madam President, we are not asking for more bureaucracy, as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago.	48.4370837117242
We are looking for solutions.	44.553010847177575
Of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea.	171.80791622630997
The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question.	59.39309482573726
"The more progress is made towards trade liberalisation, the more rules are needed", as Commissioner Lamy said during the Millennium Round in Seattle.	123.37011284063605
He recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the European Union's construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations.	32.047750128910955
Now that financing is readily available across national boundaries without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary, all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day is employed in speculative transactions.	172.4617670199796
We citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation.	103.65182687430443
To continue would be economic suicide.	155.2870300688141
Honourable Members, Commissioner, it is often said that Europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector, but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector.	56.95815717450896
If we look at the private sector, however, we will find not only that this fabled 'financial stability' has been unsuccessful but that we are most probably sitting on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.	47.734844367148284
The debt burdens of the private sector and the corresponding excessive inflation of Stock Exchange securities, the two main market stability indicators, have, for some time, been at danger levels, as the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe clearly illustrates.	92.24533685405865
The fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a panic can be explained by overambitious expectations over future gains.	90.07372227179994
Speculative activities are growing beyond measure and are, in turn, generating profits which will eventually prove to be merely fictitious.	111.53439932037438
Over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear, which, in turn, will result in a stock market and economic crisis.	123.82332639352508
The danger is too great for us to ignore.	91.00399061427612
We ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem.	62.84100673470589
Modern economic science has provided an exceptional instrument with the Tobin proposal and others, which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start.	66.8733646263955
That is what we are lacking, Commissioner: the political will to make a start in tackling speculation.	93.76807190870777
No longer should there be a place in democracy for the worship of, or for this fatalist approach towards, market forces as adopted by the liberals - and I am sorry that Mr Gasòliba I Böhm has left - as this will only lead to its ruin.	65.61645130075571
Madam President, Mr Bolkestein, the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable.	51.30123444485643
We needed a Greek Member to finally tell us what this Tobin tax means.	148.42894140837788
You reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it.	55.22877734311941
That the Right opposes taxes is quite understandable, except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions, or rather billions, into Switzerland.	127.64934763275517
We all know that!	17.23311788010168
But now I call on you, in all consciousness, to help put a stop to speculative financial transactions and undermining long-term projects with long-term capital.	81.82364724813642
It has never been done in south-east Asia, it has never been done in Europe, and I can understand why Mr Karas from Austria has left the chamber, given Austria' s financial record.	49.472927464577864
They are all tarred with the same dirty brush!	22.254798741853516
We need a Tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene.	47.35004581296175
Madam President, I am totally appalled by the Commission' s, i.e. Mr Bolkestein' s, political ignorance!	32.203364426536076
He should perhaps use his position on the Tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all!	76.4815460978158
Madam President, I too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre.	38.599883709671175
It is perhaps not by chance that the Conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades.	98.64757872274981
If we continue down this path, and this is the ideology, and declare the financial markets to be sacrosanct and even claim that any intervention in the workings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy, then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportions.	60.46891669545771
Those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested.	101.2130351431826
We have asset inflation of global proportions.	85.89633931834855
As a result, speculative bubbles continually arise on the financial markets, causing growing economic instability which, in turn, jeopardises the entire economy.	89.20203510196161
And it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result.	37.32509397343901
We can take action against this; it is possible.	40.92648664387255
The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last, not only by the Commission, but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe.	34.33273236513922
That too is feasible.	73.58350664075205
And then perhaps everyone will stop bandying about arguments which are asking for trouble!	143.31868605550815
It is not correct that the Tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer.	30.394475479747186
The fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European banks here at home must not be ignored.	111.80095516699234
In short, we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other, because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results.	98.0018356746758
Madam President, let us indeed tax money speculation: it does not produce anything new.	208.25081817252354
The tax would be targeted at the right place: at the speculators.	43.770548460699644
Who is going to defend these speculators, when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax?	67.40219766880513
Article 73 c of the Treaty establishing the European Union provides scope for taxation on transactions.	53.58727106145446
Those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres, the tax havens, of which there are 62 in all.	138.5627827943328
The Union should make a tax pact, which any countries could initially be party to.	202.3581289886519
The low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems.	233.64159140104513
It is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect.	39.501783595152624
The European Union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries, and you see how we are today.	52.30458008199062
The truth is the greatest problem is a political one: they do not want to tax capital, but raise personal taxation instead.	108.15425163864893
In the end tax would politicise the global, undemocratic system of financial power.	83.89483071972279
Ladies and gentlemen, we must challenge the monopoly the world' s speculative elite have on planning the world' s economy by remaining outside the tax system.	107.83533756997257
Madam President, may I begin by extending a heartfelt thanks to all speakers and, above all of course, Mr Désir, for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening.	28.746464499948175
Whatever one may think about the topic of debate, it is evident that it is an important one.	40.61544979156839
This is why it has been around for years, and it is satisfying that the Commission is being afforded the opportunity this evening to give a response.	27.974725749309695
I would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the Member of your Parliament, Mr Gasòliba.	35.08517220370037
He said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon, and I share his view.	67.4680844490852
I believe that globalisation has helped many countries which, so far, have been on the sideline of the world trade streams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and, as far as I am aware, no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade.	63.04332529615984
In other words, as indeed already remarked by Mr Gasòliba, globalisation is, in my view, positive, and I am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years.	44.79678713907549
A second remark made by Mr Gasòliba was that there is currently no evidence that the Tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates.	47.92575231313462
I think that he is correct in this regard.	20.32034634927125
I too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates.	66.6297727511932
I am of the opinion that these are two important remarks, and that is why I am reiterating them here.	24.286772716923974
Madam President, could I furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the Tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the European Union on the other?	26.23621912121753
Surely we are all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement.	39.56007664174089
Madam President, I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consists partly of attempting, in conjunction with my offices and colleagues, to completely integrate the financial markets within Europe, thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible.	107.9978954232192
In my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market, I am, in other words, opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions.	48.18991307570018
You could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would, in fact, impede international economic movement.	76.4555114903903
Once again, the Tobin tax is, in my view, at odds with the Treaty of Rome, and this is an important, theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening.	21.05260383347041
Madam President, apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations, there are also practical objections to the Tobin tax, as already underlined by Mr Karas and other speakers.	68.22335148470614
It has unfortunately been observed, I have to say, that the European Union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures. This indicates how difficult these dossiers are.	61.341786143873115
If we have not been able to reach agreement internally, I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners.	43.010102583067926
I think that this will be problematic.	10.279041060753098
Madam President, Mr Jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets.	29.562835101830974
I think, however, that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes. I think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when, as already stated, the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome.	50.45154422021341
In order to remove these causes, one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question.	39.895748332358
Is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in English 'good governance' ?	65.04109261494301
Is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates?	40.486911779745775
That the markets for production factors, including the labour market, operate flexibly?	127.23939214172825
That is not always the case.	14.560467574243448
So if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability, then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first.	63.91113426214685
In addition - and this has also been mentioned already, for example by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm, but also by others - there is a need for more supervision.	37.91201092930629
More supervision nationally - supervision by national governments of national banks - and internationally, for example by means of the IMF.	93.57917495738705
So I believe the best way to tackle the causes is by ensuring, on the one hand, that good governance is observed in the countries in question and that, on the other hand, there is more supervision nationally and internationally in order to avoid these lapses.	46.41042801313237
Madam President, according to various Members of your Parliament, more funding should still be made available for major projects.	85.89273504013188
For example, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler spoke in English about 'long-term capital for long-term projects' - this is an obvious issue.	54.065690842038414
My reply to this is that, firstly, countries should honour their pledges, namely make 0.7% of their Gross National Product available for development aid and cooperation, so that a great deal more money becomes available than at present for such long-term projects and via a route established for the purpose, namely contributions to development cooperation, and not via an artificial and probably harmful route, namely the Tobin tax.	142.59862899386508
Madam President, I should like to leave it here. As far as the resolution is concerned, of which I have seen a draft, the Commission will await the vote and will, based on this, determine its stance.	63.512275124146946
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate.	14.549311023167466
I have received four motions for a resolution, tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure.	26.576209138018275
Madam President, unfortunately I do not have your mastery of the French language.	38.304309535072264
But I would be obliged if Mr Bolkestein would just listen for a minute, which I think he cannot do at the same time as talking to Mrs Randzio-Plath.	51.310849043295846
Could you please draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him?	29.655892331646232
Monsieur Bolkestein, je veux vous dire quelque chose!	26.58318627820854
Unfortunately, my Dutch is not as good as yours.	95.2380736434123
But I would rather like to say something else to you.	26.467688379972905
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission.	122.10712568851183
We want to examine the possibility of introducing a Tobin tax.	31.284182293377206
It will be just one of several instruments and hopefully you will be on our side in this.	54.6785774883186
From a political point of view, I always fret when people say, we neither need, want nor can we achieve these things!	138.98536090887117
It is not your job, it is our job to decide on that.	37.384328147023346
It also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this Parliament.	26.547078309903934
I just want to discuss it with you, no more and no less.	80.46011476366763
We can do so without going off at other tangents. I respect you as a serious Commissioner who wants to take his work seriously.	81.3750983585009
Please respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously, and that includes the Tobin tax!	50.742545814873345
Madam President, an omission appears to have been made. In the list of tabled motions for a resolution which you have just read out, no mention is made of the compromise motion tabled jointly by the PSE, ELDR, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA Groups and by Mrs Kuntz and Mr Coûteaux.	50.029420686417076
Mr Désir, I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution.	39.31573808578499
If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled, it will be included.	72.95769837616494
The debate is closed.	3.77548916318001
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	5.325701709630239
(The sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m.)	8.866930665841181
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	14.546692295191853
Mr President, I simply wanted to pass on some news. There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid.	47.63418439268331
Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died.	156.5233953892025
On behalf of my Group, I once again condemn these terrorist acts.	37.26102286346174
Thank you, Mrs Fraga Estévez.	12.10296426542524
We had heard about this regrettable incident.	62.26189264467944
Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society. I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish.	132.40743640624916
(The Minutes were approved)	22.452217819019545
Resumption of the session	34.0179758294628
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 January 2000.	12.446435878393052
Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy.	18.59825147784273
Two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits, causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans.	100.76744932230339
Since then, the victims' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least.	115.81494970497974
I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities, and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims' families.	26.231928403482037
Mrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment.	36.13614550282298
Agenda	634.2024716887657
The next item is the order of business.	14.08358584091597
Following a request to this effect, which I have received from a number of political groups, and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held, I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance, pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, on the subject of the European Union' s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government.	44.914853920296125
If you decide to add this debate to the agenda, it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission.	29.430019601154736
Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?	19.656355226952783
Madam President, I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents, and, since I publicly criticised the presidency in January, I would like to take this opportunity to say, both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group, that we now find the presidency' s statements on this issue to be appropriate, and we agree on their basis, their importance and their form.	31.26055450417992
Madam President, it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure.	36.566980126639464
This debate is topical, exceptionally important and urgent.	39.801008456047555
We therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it.	21.91221489386547
(Applause)	42.81948661699828
Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal?	30.057097465835
Madam President, I shall speak against this proposal on the grounds of a principle which I consider absolutely vital with regard to observance of the Treaties, and with particular regard to Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	26.883192673179444
Madam President, until now we believed that the European Union was, according to the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Paris founding the European Communities, and subsequently the Union, an association of free, independent, sovereign states.	66.91601208127705
Even though many developments cast doubt on this, we did believe, in spite of everything, that this was the case and, more recently, reference was made, albeit half-heartedly, to the principle of subsidiarity.	88.74752120618221
Well, patently, if we do open this debate today, Madam President, as you are requesting and as the Conference of Presidents is requesting, on the basis of Rule 50, we shall then be opening up a fearsome breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national states and the free constitution of democratically elected governments, enabling some other majority in this Parliament, at some future time, to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it has assumed power on the basis of free, regular, peaceful and democratic elections within a Member State.	61.355184126508725
If you ratify ...	86.45873134464173
Mr Gollnisch, excuse me, you have one minute.	43.050965287293494
I know that you always take particular care to ensure that the Rules of Procedure are observed.	32.58619930429041
Madam President, I thought I had three minutes.	26.089122849245218
Do forgive me.	177.7026921594346
If you ratify this development, then you are ratifying the development of the Union into a body which violates the sovereignty and the freedom of the Member States, and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a Union.	51.459247121933146
We have heard one speaker in favour and one against.	85.03397320128396
I shall now, therefore, put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote.	32.88082439503817
(Parliament gave its assent)	57.786768702382076
This debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business.	40.64021799340726
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE	78.25143574487078
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	10.9470966398933
Talks in Austria on forming a government	170.3345516217062
The next item is the debate on the talks in Austria on forming a government.	20.62892174529689
I shall immediately give the floor to Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council.	17.143980969502774
Madam President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, the Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the European public.	22.076988630881022
Let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts.	47.168931594324455
Firstly, we wish to express our total support for, and our solidarity with, the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the 14 Member States, because we believe that this statement is in accordance with the common values, and not just the political force, which we have all built together.	42.44511631927301
In any event, these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party ironically known as the Austrian Freedom Party.	83.41376494500366
The Europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered, and the Socialist Group condemns the insults which have been directed at the President of the French Republic and the Belgian Government, but also at the Socialists, who are European citizens as well, because, at the moment, the Austrian Socialists are being described as traitors to their country.	54.299754760081676
I will say one thing. For many years I was a traitor to my country; at least that was General Franco' s view.	62.5486021923164
President Guterres was also a traitor in Salazar' s eyes, and that is something that I believe should also be stated and defended by the PPE-DE.	43.16910322475505
I also believe that the Commission, or President Prodi, has acted as a guardian of the Treaties.	22.430404136069637
However, I would remind him that, during his inaugural debate, he described the Commission as a European government.	40.83816814705785
A government must have more nerve and more courage.	97.37675547796525
That is what I am asking President Prodi for at this moment.	37.94986676828263
(Applause)	42.81948661699828
With all due respect to a Commissioner as effective as Mr Fischler, and given that we have heard contradictory comments, depending on the translation, with regard to a possible request by President Prodi for the resignation of Mr Fischler, I would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this House.	66.51425632695565
Secondly, Madam President, we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people.	27.21803317102898
This is an appeal to the majority of Austrians who have not voted for Haider, who have voted for the clearly democratic options, committed to Europe, and I must point out that Mr Schüssel may have been Minister for Finance, but Chancellor Vranitzky also contributed to Austria' s integration process.	105.67138215225225
We should not be so politically partisan.	30.187596425914098
The accession of Austria to the Community was a joint venture.	102.26463900207101
We all took part in it, not just one group.	69.37325900219469
Therefore, Madam President, I believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the Austrians to reconsider and reflect, because this type of menace, which we have suffered before in Europe, may not only harm Austria, but it may also spread, and I say this bearing history in mind.	82.01700730585169
Therefore, apart from the apology which Mr Schüssel has made, offering us all kinds of guarantees, as did Chamberlain and Daladier in 1938 in Munich, I would like to know whether the PPE intends to implement measures in relation to the Austrian People' s Party, if it goes ahead with this mad project.	46.99063874433383
Thirdly, if we do not stand up to this unnatural alliance, I can assure you that we can forget the European Union' s main objective - enlargement - because, if we were Czechs, Slovenes or Hungarians, what would we say, faced with a neighbour who judges us on racial grounds and does not want us to enter?	50.37596514200108
I therefore think that this is a great day for European politics to commence.	26.930902056864145
We support the Council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the Austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option.	48.83702672540932
(Applause from the PSE Group)	21.4213999689991
Madam President, we could have been debating the need to reinforce the founding principles of the Union, so that we can uphold them together.	36.462623686920985
Instead, we have been forced to debate the formal, substantial errors that have been made in the last few days.	34.09100008982779
We are astonished by the political naivety of people who, with thoughtless words, have bolstered Mr Haider' s position in Austria and made the Union look ridiculous, riding roughshod over Article 7 of the Treaty by announcing unconstitutional measures.	64.24862082080878
We have never before seen such serious, clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	57.26520819952906
Of course, we cannot violate the founding values of Europe, and in this regard, the Italian Prime Minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty: he mentioned the Treaty of Copenhagen, which I, like you, have never heard of because it does not exist.	59.29476141783993
Maybe he was referring to the Treaty of Amsterdam, Article 6 of which lists certain principles and Article 7 certain procedures, in order to establish that a Member State is seriously and continuously violating the principles referred to in Article 6.	69.54731105318064
However, up till now, Austria has committed no serious or persistent violation.	222.72931987749246
Apart from amounting to interference, the statement by the Presidency is discriminatory because it authorises the penalisation of a population and denies these people their right to choose who to vote for.	80.93607063864192
No political cohesion has so far come about, not even in the fight against organised crime, or in defence of the victims of genocide; we do not have a currency that is even remotely stable or an economy which really does combat unemployment and poverty; but it only took one minute of iconoclastic fury to destroy the Union' s credibility.	77.07798013358459
Sanctions can be imposed after the Treaties have been violated, but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government.	87.2023846992126
Otherwise, how will we deal with Communist countries which return to Communism: will we throw them out of the Union too if Communists enter into government, or will Stalin' s grandchildren be forgiven for everything?	130.6734737639163
(Applause from the right) It is via diplomacy, persuasion, knowledge, and solidarity, and not with threats or via anti-constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles.	147.47026976425792
Bilateral relations involve the States, so the 14 do not come into this.	219.83129529177646
This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking, with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes. It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions.	68.01981377299013
So many things set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region.	149.1720369419375
However, we already knew this.	57.8547314120386
However, today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union' s democratic role.	51.715220773362674
We support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples, and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights.	78.3436909827785
We believe in Europe, while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union.	74.67904420947353
This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks.	114.98465219447696
We have built a Europe with an unstable market, not a Europe with principles, rights and politics.	111.53833498701586
And these are the consequences!	60.546096393477335
Therefore, we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people, thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples.	63.04437745394244
Madam President, today we have an appointment with hypocrisy.	87.71868407635188
Here we have a Council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a State in the event of a serious and persistent breach.	48.23176403646973
In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria.	27.33281689121286
There are risks, as we are all aware, but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach.	43.06058387016505
If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criteria to the European Union, then, most certainly, this European Union could not become a member, although the countries of Eastern Europe are required to meet them.	58.18611738414841
And if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches, then perhaps we could mention some Member States, such as Italy and France, first and third, respectively, in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court.	84.96223465537865
We could mention, my Belgian friends, Belgium and the Dutroux case, the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country, where inquiries are bogged down, making no headway.	87.32571891938703
We could, if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested, require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter.	65.11929489523985
We could ask ourselves why the Austrians are rejecting 10 years, 13 years of party politics which has made one country - Austria - corrupt and rotten, just as it is now corrupting countries such as Italy, Belgium and other European Union Member States.	101.88673852448363
We might well wonder why 76% of Belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56% of French citizens have no confidence in their country' s system of justice, and 53% of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice...	109.54916705458852
(The President cut the speaker off)	8.491221292876252
Madame President, my group, the EDD, and especially my party, are very concerned by this debate.	54.66306638619798
We cannot, and we do not, support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich.	64.25888474404198
We also, however, deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country, especially one which is part of the European Union.	44.18406359774093
My party at home are certainly not racists, but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well.	56.46835761147478
Are you going to interfere with Great Britain' s Parliament if we are elected?	66.86488303473448
Madame President, the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament.	131.8457037686191
I believe they gave him 28% of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government.	93.74911589422774
Your Parliament, may I suggest, Madame President, should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country.	129.30038603270526
Then, and only then, might you consider if human rights are affected.	145.51268037892814
Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then, Madame President and only then, may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union.	144.2863476557779
Madam President, as a representative of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria.	34.4898195855463
My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights, having a sense of responsibility for one' s own past, and the stability of democracy.	94.74634337646505
Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it, rightly or wrongly.	184.3761700522624
The refusal of our government, down through the years, to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the Second World War, together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour, have done a great deal to bolster this negative image.	82.8178106476837
This FPÖ has now entered into a coalition with the ÖVP, due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999, when the previous government was voted out of office.	102.00539960698705
This is the citizen of a state' s prerogative, for it is the founding principle of a democracy.	66.16654095275868
When the talks between the SPÖ and ÖVP broke down, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for their support.	88.32694784202054
We were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here!	129.43511119208048
When we suddenly refused this offer, an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day.	126.62662431201974
The FPÖ party is established in Austria' s political landscape.	90.08862732760142
The head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments.	48.4222348735469
What many Austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind, and why the campaign did not begin until the Freedom Party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the SPÖ?	85.33626267884706
There is prejudice at work here, which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle.	110.49205930930397
I am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda, as, for example, the Italian MEP Bertinotti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Haider of denying the holocaust.	67.94820396039606
Shame on you Mr Bertinotti!	110.10223463167138
You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda.	72.78368321365942
Denouncing a democratically elected politician as a Nazi does not make you an anti-fascist!	69.7778417151953
On the contrary, you are deriding the true victims of National Socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did.	75.76299765456594
Your behaviour stems from your own prejudices, you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose.	98.29237101624338
The attacks against Austria' s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a Member State are an insult to the Austrian people.	58.7401765794189
That is why we are indebted to the Commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest.	34.73848758627027
The new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy, the rights of the opposition, commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour....	122.48483337483428
(The President cut the speaker off)	8.491221292876252
Madam President, to begin with, I would like to make one thing abundantly clear: Austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion.	53.473135217863835
Austria is a stable democracy; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary.	76.36369545722488
Austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there.	131.30544931982323
There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Austria: there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections, in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found.	87.11859700236299
There will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition.	110.07924166638608
The Austrian People' s Party, which I represent here in this Parliament, used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union, and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement.	58.84036787794709
We respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria.	74.2774883295407
Our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present.	72.44487637526129
Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship, many people were perpetrators too, although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt.	100.33071409979549
The ÖVP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union.	120.08535271874726
My country' s place is not outside the European Union but in it ...	48.86522415015517
..., with all the rights and commitments that this entails!	80.60327180402656
Any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it professes to in its manifesto, and not according to the prejudgements put about both by political adversaries and the international media.	76.21901799237452
A declared belief in human rights, democracy and the rule of law, in an honest reappraisal of Austria' s role in the past, in passing on information on the gravest crime against humanity in the 20th century, the holocaust, will also be reflected in the fundamental accord underlying a future coalition government between the ÖVP and FPÖ.	93.56837704966853
My party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of European politics and continues to be rooted in the European community of values!	70.01127306634903
(Applause)	42.81948661699828
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Representatives of the Commission, it is a black day for Austria and for Europe.	24.024113976616277
Not even Mr Sichrovsky' s web of lies or Mrs Stenzel' s words of appeasement can do anything to change that.	84.91282298553375
For the day has dawned: two irresponsible politicians, consumed with a lust for power, are selling Austria' s image, political role, and to some extent even its economic interests, down the river!	167.39209199705547
(Applause, heckling)	158.1837638579843
They are trading this in for a head of government' s position and for membership of a government.	124.30422294348341
They are just as prepared to take on board the fact that Austria will go from being a revered country to a reviled one, as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens.	67.76661695085915
I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics, and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community, insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives, are grave and also inappropriate.	70.43586419640032
However, my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage, is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so, Messrs Schüssel and Haider and their parties, ...	129.61483951783168
... and that includes their representatives in this Parliament.	64.5939877705858
Mr Poettering, it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as I am, albeit for different reasons, for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions.	60.59932834886985
You are having to defend a certain Mr Schüssel, you are having to consort with Schüssel as he is today and who, as I understand it, was recently told not to come to the representatives of the Christian Democratic party' s summit meeting.	112.8683435660659
The argument that Mr Poettering himself used has come into play, i.e. that it would only be possible to deprive Haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system.	71.21970114792565
However, in my view, he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this, into our political system, and into the Europe of today, than any other extreme right-wing movement.	85.46111406392077
Anyone who feeds on prejudice towards foreigners and ethnic minorities and gives succour to these prejudices, whose programme features parochialism and anti-liberalism, who displays loutish behaviour and arrogance in their international relations, and who has never yet distanced themselves clearly and unequivocally from National Socialism, has neither the intention nor inclination to integrate!	119.12124386570379
(Applause)	42.81948661699828
This historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the Conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured.	60.09798735384515
That is how the wolf - albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the ÖVP - is sustained rather than kept in check.	84.04101316409505
I understand that Europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government.	44.33373506405387
However, by the same token, there is another Austria, the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the FPÖ having any involvement in government, and who will continue to demonstrate against this government.	132.4491763992528
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria!	65.73116072108328
(Applause)	42.81948661699828
The more powerful this Europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the Europe of today, the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism.	81.64109764115425
For Europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy, or even against a relapse into barbarism.	89.79630359287584
Please support the Austrian people against this government!	196.3491303550543
(Applause)	42.81948661699828
Madam President, this is an historic moment, as it is now, at last, quite clear to us all that the European Union has gradually developed into a community of values.	49.01597909614572
We see this, now that the government of one Member State is being joined by a party which, as is known, does not respect all these values.	66.21341028301491
I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the Council was justified, as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union, meaning this is also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria' s.	28.110093515997544
As Members of Parliament, we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever.	28.922007317017027
It is more important than ever that respect for, and non-violation of, human values and the rights of minorities, including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the European Union, form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the EU, and, for this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding.	40.573280784825926
It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration.	33.010019992163144
As important is the fact that Austria' s forces of democracy should be given support, as none of us wishes to isolate the country.	93.6882947646784
We know that most Austrians respect these values.	155.83475404889845
They have also shown how they feel: not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria.	114.58433170118339
Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time.	60.70784322674887
I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy.	119.47877636806328
I also appeal to the Austrian President, that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces.	82.24062259155714
Madam President, I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group, Francis Wurtz, reminded us of just now.	41.367224153064456
I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes Jörg Haider' s party.	46.30875162158245
The fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because, as you know, we essentially disagree with the policies made by Europe, with its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit and the Member States' involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans.	46.88101789538731
Our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today: this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational, neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary.	118.0709849231696
This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe.	336.44436729816044
We are talking about us, not Austria.	56.83409088265889
We know the social causes which contribute, along with unemployment and instability, to fuelling tendencies towards this; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia, racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe.	121.27109197056501
Not only the Alpine region, but all our countries are involved: the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat.	119.01598054065767
The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation.	37.2920755137544
Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past.	98.07350036010553
Now, though, it should follow through with its actions, and the first to follow through should be the Commission, which, however, has been obscure and weak on this, making the value of the presidency' s position even more apparent.	100.99088736847209
This is the change we must impose on the Commission' s action.	30.25182123726111
Madam President, despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, which opposes fascism, nazism or communism, both new and old, and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the Austrian people, we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by Parliament.	91.34222358915801
In the manifesto of the Austrian Democratic Freedom Party, there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms or the rule of law, enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaties.	46.37191529435446
I would, however, like to draw your attention to the fact that the President-in-Office, who has been so critical of Austria, has recently consigned the inhabitants of Macao to the sovereign rule of the People' s Democratic Republic of China.	29.15722093457377
Perhaps, in order to strengthen the Union' s democracy, it would now be appropriate to isolate Austria and criminalise a party that was democratically elected by the Austrian citizens, while bringing Turkey and its "Grey Wolves" into Europe.	78.24636131526512
Madam President, we are debating an extremely serious issue.	18.865206106924862
We are debating nothing less than the presence in a Member State' s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral bases of the Union enshrined in its founding Treaties.	54.054232610638216
A simple reading of chapter 4, article 1 of the Austrian Freedom Party' s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience shudder.	148.4743868351385
The view that ethnicity is the defining factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group has superiority over others, as is written here, revives old ghosts of the century which we have just left behind, which some historians have described as the century of horrors; horrors which the unacceptable philosophy behind Mr Haider' s manifesto has stirred up once again, to our amazement.	105.80090834929513
Of course Austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	38.492744922641364
However, that is not the problem.	20.94678208779573
The question is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State which includes such a party.	34.48059459800934
Our answer to this crucial question is no.	105.0337884388136
Leaving aside strategic and tactical considerations, leaving aside possible exonerations based on other people' s behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interests, the Spanish delegation of the People' s Group of this Parliament, in full agreement with the Spanish People' s Party and the Spanish Government, clearly expresses its full agreement with the statement of 31 January by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council.	101.66660245549016
We agree with its substance, its tone and its scope.	152.9189710672654
(Applause)	42.81948661699828
Konrad Adenauer once said - and he knew what he was saying - that the surest way to pacify a tiger was to allow it to devour you.	62.05995116001316
History is a compendium of events which could have been avoided.	31.432409129864503
Therefore, Madam President, the Union and the Assembly must send an unequivocal message, rejecting of the tiger of intolerance, xenophobia and totalitarianism, so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdications, renunciations and opportunism which mark Europe' s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price.	83.59744796237761
(Loud applause)	24.314994226401275
Madam President, the European Union was built upon the idea 'never again' , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia, concentration camps, anti-Semitism, heightened nationalism or war.	113.545049365703
The one and only significance of the European Union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the coup de grâce to any ideal of humanism within the heart of Europe, and which is still highly topical today.	52.84802488802719
It is not true to say that, when a government forms an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe, this is merely a question of national sovereignty.	50.25316289967596
For this Union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances.	128.0620284498751
It is a Community that is destined to exist, in which, when the main thing is under threat, when values are under threat, all democrats must bend over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again.	84.96138388347721
Let us learn the lessons of the past.	18.8597105768129
In the thirties, when Adolf Hitler was democratically elected, although with a minority, many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and, Mr Poettering, in France, a number of men and women, on the right wing but perhaps of other political persuasions too, thought, 'Better Hitler in France than the Front Populaire.'	100.10109925979361
They put their own petty squabbles first, and the rest is history.	111.56248387354556
We must make a rapid, strong and united response.	73.75243531983917
I would have liked to hear your discussion with the Austrian President, Mr Poettering. We are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance.	54.38518828693647
So our response must be rapid and strong.	84.67814630080323
Of course, the Treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable; I was almost going to say 'irreparable' .	88.38247624751621
History has taught us that Fascists start to blow hot and cold: using heated words first, in populist, xenophobic speeches, and then cool words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to infiltrate them gradually, poisoning them, until the day they start to take action.	140.45935457925577
And when that day comes, it is too late.	85.2914324243693
So our Treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late, but we are not at that point: today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point.	46.85349627299627
We must therefore find a political solution.	18.519115213827313
I support the Council proposals in this, while deploring a certain lack of strength, a certain spinelessness, on the part of the Commission which will, however, have to be vigilant on a day-by-day basis, with determination over time, since Fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy, they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end.	83.59314293732145
Our response must be rapid.	71.96478696658923
If today we do not staunchly support the Council, then history will judge us, saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the Munich Agreement.	112.6302271113882
Madam President, I am pleased about the fact that, in Austria, the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes, in my eyes, a huge victory for democracy.	48.93328640940839
Let there be no doubt about it: we decline with thanks a Europe which develops into a kind of "big brother" and which keeps watch over left-wing political correctness in one Member State or another in a Stalinist way and using Stalinist methods.	96.1698458825307
European democracy and Austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a Belgian Government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party, which was condemned by the court, to the post of European Commissioner.	122.3931713375946
Today, we thank the Austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within Europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech.	92.66136812656421
Madam President, this debate was opened by Mr Da Costa, who merely confirms that the EU presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States.	36.752686697949244
This debate, and the background to it, reinforced the point that the Council, the Commission and this Parliament itself are dominated by Socialists.	78.90011292944105
My delegation of 37 Conservative and Unionist Members from the United Kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy, programme and tone of Austria' s Freedom Party.	121.93158651258935
We share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history, in particular World War II, but also its policies on enlargement, on immigration, on race and its attitude to the European Union itself.	130.0486326469932
We were also outraged, however, at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny, the terror and the excesses of the former USSR.	36.93516209243956
Even today, surely it is high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fraternal links with China' s Communist Party.	72.50231193891373
Not a word was said by these same EU governments about coalition governments involving fellow-travelling communists in French or Italian governments, or in German state governments, or even the British government' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in Northern Ireland today.	201.62390665594785
This, Madam President, is the hypocrisy of the left.	36.67236092837497
So we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards, especially of the British government and the other largely socialist heads of EU governments and include that of the United States.	84.20471388665169
We should recognise, however, that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results.	85.55546400171586
This requires action to address the underlying causes, including an examination of the electoral process itself.	93.95784299064208
That should be our task, not political posturing.	82.83522783768778
Madam President, Representative of the Council, Commissioner, a week ago, the big international Holocaust Conference ended in Stockholm.	64.09388055520866
Its aim was to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism.	50.38785700576002
It would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite, at this time, into the institutions of the EU, a xenophobic party which flirts with Nazi ideas.	54.264837493736536
Secondly, I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations.	23.361713093690337
We demand of the candidate States and of the countries with which the EU cooperates under the Lomé Agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours.	83.01126379107686
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned.	24.663035304773288
That is why we are reacting against this carry-on in Austria.	31.679329320583797
It is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened.	34.554521310183404
We are at a watershed in the history of the European Union.	12.852959360261243
The Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values, something which we take seriously. Something has happened.	56.31210597721214
The European Union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its spine.	58.215534839041936
Madam President, as everyone has said, this is a very important day. It is the day of the first debate of European political life.	45.5959752415559
And this is not pure chance.	38.14241449573528
I feel that today' s meeting is not a meeting of Europe, our institutions, with Austria or Mr Haider' s party.	65.85530229013905
It is the meeting of Europe with itself, with its raison d' être, with the reasons why we are here in this Chamber.	33.50258725403721
This Chamber was not made for goods, it was not made for money.	68.60025691951266
This Chamber, and the European institutions, were build to uphold values, morality and a certain spirit.	190.228081579243
In the twentieth century, we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk, and morality, values and the spirit which I mentioned can be mortally affected by viruses which have just one name: nationalist glorification, populism and the concept of racial superiority.	57.792638189583485
The fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of Mr Haider' s party, the FPÖ, to find nationalist glorification, populism and racial superiority in every chapter.	50.55123927996416
Reading only one sentence which my friend, Mr Vidal-Quadras, has previously mentioned, "The nation is defined by its location, culture and race, locally, ethnically and culturally."	105.22126977285637
Well, we cannot accept such statements.	85.45740580021237
If Europe has any meaning, and - my friends will pardon me telling them - if Christian democracy has any meaning, if the history of Christian democracy has any meaning, then it must declare itself radically opposed to the statements made in this manifesto and, whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same dish up again, must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation.	153.6796356627692
This is the reason why I feel that the European Parliament, which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the Council or the Commission, must pay tribute to those people in the various States and European institutions who had the courage to say no, and it must say, Madam President, that you made a statement on our behalf which does us credit, and in clear terms declare, without prevarication, its opposition to and condemnation of imminent events in Austria, recalling the statement made on the day of the Munich Agreement by a great French Christian Democrat who said that, if you are going to have to say no, then the best time to do so is right at the beginning.	69.14380122942283
(Applause)	42.81948661699828
Madam President, we the Belgian Christian Democrats are concerned as, fortunately, are a great many other Members too.	67.58835128098777
The coalition which is being created in one of the Member States is clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly has a European dimension too.	63.19137088031514
Because what is it that unites us in Europe? Surely it is the values and principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, more than anything.	60.30340678468889
The Austrian Freedom Party leader, Mr Haider, has repeatedly repudiated these values.	131.97565497937816
He also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness.	56.87443089456697
He is a dangerous man.	61.029083933760845
The Christian Democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme-right voters but never to negotiate with extreme-right leaders.	86.0129045016294
Values should take precedence over power.	271.0233012490121
We deplore, therefore, what is happening in Austria.	42.141010797062116
In fact, we were shaken by it.	33.57936441858989
We are extremely disappointed.	65.61685805072462
As a last resort, we would ask the ÖVP to look into alternatives.	35.802388612407505
We keep reminding them about Article 6 of the Treaty.	49.20433791596365
We continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right.	19.32548302829748
If, despite this, the coalition goes ahead, we would urge the ÖVP party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie European integration are observed in political programmes, both in word and deed.	111.06815734062944
Madam President, Austria awaits a heavy responsibility.	110.06024197230587
Madam President, it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting Mr Haider and his politics, but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics.	43.07861551879109
Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself?	82.21235315892942
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here?	63.07531874116937
Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days?	39.7493537879258
From all accounts, this would only serve to strengthen Haider.	222.20718879438172
Who would want this to happen?	98.96267659535694
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics?	54.1535835835455
Europe is a community of law.	42.11549863492307
Democracy, respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold.	73.96176984774482
One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them, and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians, by virtue of their political culture, voted as they did.	51.47511317823404
It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did, and in a manner that goes against the Treaty.	35.89213697350872
It would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic, constitutional and well-known European party, so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community, and that is why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation, and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take!	80.57671784612542
(Applause)	42.81948661699828
Madam President, they say, where I come from, 'it' s three times for a Welshman' , and three times, as I think you will discover in the course of that debate, I signified my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent, and on several occasions, a moving debate.	67.55210378717096
First of all, could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday.	34.02336975116189
I must respond also to the fact, of course, that there were references during the debate - and I use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity, the complacency and the fragility of the Commission' s opinion.	65.01662716377518
I am duty- bound to say to this House, there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered, or indeed the action taken, by the Commission on this issue.	43.20034140915858
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement, as did the President this afternoon, to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday.	72.82193923712566
Secondly, we said, in very specific terms, that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria.	55.899891060754875
Thirdly, we expressed, in very explicit terms, that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld.	62.69159971139927
There is no complacency, no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all.	68.02458179317657
And, when I say that the Commission took that view, I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler, who is from Austria; and who, once again, demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission, under oath, in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning.	86.08072761582478
Anyone, therefore, who invites Franz Fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is Austrian, should examine their own motives in the context of a debate, which has been necessarily shadowed by references to xenophobia and even more lethal evils in this world.	75.92204921392697
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague, Franz Fischler.	30.62665500748855
Could I also say, Madam President, that the understanding of the presidency, the Portuguese presidency, for our position, was absolutely demonstrated in the clearest terms by Mr Da Costa when he said, and I quote him, that 'Portugal and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community machine is not affected by the current situation' .	36.15020016222464
That surely is in everyone' s interests.	113.8341044735757
In order to ensure that the Treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine, we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday.	46.17667075586239
We will continue to do that, Madam President, without fear or favour.	92.56730316705263
That is our duty.	44.55618701778303
It is also a matter of conviction.	19.524640891467115
My final point is this.	41.627160526169135
We understand the context of this essential debate.	50.74634471829243
There are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with Herr Haider' s offensive statements, the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies, sometimes on successive days.	165.5658958743188
We understand that, and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of Nazism.	200.08471738792676
And, when we recall that, like many others on all sides of this House, my and my colleagues' instincts are naturally aroused.	59.4177673958484
However, the Commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct.	26.12789060428109
And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning.	50.221578173880744
That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law. Without fragility, without complacency, without ambiguity, but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people.	64.54823397365487
We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate, 'necessarily with acute vigilance' .	84.77365297153146
I wonder, since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber, whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government.	57.59849050101282
Does the Commission support the Council?	47.82589842355057
Madam President, when the Commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen Member States and shares the concern that gave rise to that view, I think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning, as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue, it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the Member States.	54.0047542538548
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	11.76527624403846
I think that we have just had a great political debate, equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it.	39.50527781252017
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.	12.48535848793252
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.	27.560960300560147
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	5.224258125996437
Recourse to the precautionary principle	38.13529466773741
The next item is the Commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle.	11.347130054134931
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle, and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen.	24.49759088319911
The precautionary principle is not a new concept.	25.95345498705412
It has been used by the Community for some time now in a range of policy areas, environmental, human, animal and plant health; and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the EC Treaty since Maastricht.	85.40493685889878
It also appears in a range of international texts, for example, the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol.	101.05008869304778
The essence of the precautionary principle is clear.	21.938655237036006
It involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear, but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action.	110.5806084611996
However, the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years.	25.444947351612388
Events such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary.	121.66698131503517
In view of this growing interest, the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle.	30.685894640603244
The basic aim of the communication is twofold.	31.898142494511706
To explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles.	82.03930232688855
We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism.	54.70434346138576
The Commission' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental, human, animal and plant health.	33.45826124221417
Of course, this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures, but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear.	58.074771175920354
As such, while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science, as some have alleged, it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics.	65.46934213302141
The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society.	62.88255185061945
It is therefore political by nature.	99.59209578159268
However, the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper.	65.03309149259769
Measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is, we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut.	54.58164670133937
They must be non-discriminatory in their application, that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin.	107.88867318765728
And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken.	64.54158605278384
For example, if one product has been approved, similar products should also be approved.	79.09859514602039
Measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action; that is, the measures should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment, that is the burden of proof.	85.51108943898295
All these elements have to apply cumulatively.	63.01435276591118
It is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures, which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle. For example, a research programme, public information campaigns, recommendations and so on.	34.25044346411177
Applying the precautionary principle does not, therefore, automatically imply a ban.	67.28473249088552
This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue; however, it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use.	39.90141782018565
By setting out in some detail how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle, we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level.	48.73454216809452
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your statement.	9.15393250527133
I have three short questions, the first being as follows.	120.09674822991023
We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice.	37.87630591054847
Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry, Foreign Trade, Competition and the Internal Market?	90.54465573437746
I am sure that your answer to this will be "yes" but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be?	46.5835205973548
My next question, Mrs Wallström, is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors, for example?	129.0031799981515
Lastly, will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation?	65.91241634230879
In other words, will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached?	57.395798493446826
. Thank you very much, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, for these questions.	24.811956289629006
Of course, this is shared by the whole Commission.	49.42464942545683
This is a common communication which was written by the three of us, David Byrne, Erkki Liikanen and myself, but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today.	62.934716933999034
It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission.	43.96179247225024
So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document.	44.30190969439307
Yes, I would say we already use this way of working with different, difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example.	119.856697836851
And, I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle.	43.79246894294251
We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys; and of course, we apply it in several different environmental areas.	57.734878622663736
It has been mainly used in the environmental field, but, of course also when it comes to human health.	25.690791292614872
So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it.	52.65129095020489
Mr President, Commissioner, regarding the relationship between science, on the one hand, and applying the precautionary principle on the other, the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence.	56.82495871206968
Needless to say, this accords science a great deal of power.	40.83094424516173
We might ask ourselves, what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for?	76.15783916183206
The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied, provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists.	75.19864477832041
I would like to ask, what is, then, the definition of a recognised minority?	24.50340889204477
How would you describe this?	34.04954037736693
What establishes a recognised minority?	148.27911259173587
If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision?	47.88930456974669
The Commission?	45.3167659154711
The Council?	103.80406885114135
And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this?	28.057157658664707
What is the role of the scientific committees?	26.009502504957084
What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up?	60.58049107774459
Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way?	59.225643662435864
These are my three questions.	94.50233238647213
. Yes, Mr President, that is true.	49.94146986288249
There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions.	66.177584607162
Who will take the decision, who are the decision-makers?	107.9458955622936
Well, that depends on who the legislators are.	128.13312752946118
This is part of risk management.	35.96704908699082
They have to look at, for example, the concerns of people in relation to a special issue, and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case.	42.38134941156464
However, it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle.	22.161852598756305
It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete.	81.81623443840704
That is, of course, where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science.	45.68696861300531
It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base.	43.93842536758098
We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision; and that should also be done in the future.	46.099064893064394
You have to see this as a tool for risk management.	37.93133203960473
You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger, for example, or if you want to protect the environment; and you have to look at the science that is available.	38.04483509257468
You have to assess all that and evaluate the science.	74.70436702927233
Then you decide to take a measure or not, to take action or not.	69.01283537130068
So, there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today.	53.0179937689419
Mr President, I have a question concerning an actual, concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle.	26.39118472998438
It is about brominated flame retardants.	18.351894627091735
It is a fact that these substances are now being discovered. There are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment.	39.74055064431536
There are many people who maintain that they entail major risks, while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are.	161.05403060355206
Recently, both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants.	57.18975636504653
I am wondering, therefore, if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative.	49.094960380187324
. (SV) Mr President, thank you very much, Mr Sjöstedt, for this question.	15.927726561559954
The issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one.	20.72146027203339
It was raised quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of ministers who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done.	74.76006468398552
We are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do.	44.581934038184045
Allow me to remind you, however, that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban.	32.411753152082774
There may be a series of different measures which can be taken.	25.026056342073165
It ought not, therefore, to be immediately interpreted as a ban.	49.23494247335669
Where brominated flame retardants are concerned, there may eventually be a ban, but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken.	33.36779614429739
This issue is extremely topical.	32.622874802680215
The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done.	36.1243010927398
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier.	19.84274614209823
Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean?	41.34271270885115
I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops.	47.98913066135989
Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do?	61.375725579347865
. (SV) Mr President, I am pleased to be able to tell you that, in Montreal, we have just signed a protocol concerning bio-safety.	31.92832623686591
We succeeded there in agreeing, at an international forum, as to the definition of the precautionary principle.	53.420622436261034
I consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol.	36.506090328920315
I believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle.	69.55855413145892
We are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted.	15.186458583285228
It is, moreover, also accepted as an important and effective tool.	41.37930774319673
Mr President, I have two questions. I shall try to be very brief indeed.	24.06899302357128
The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle.	12.3258034709175
As I have understood it, there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood.	37.541439114001214
Is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out, including a cost-benefit analysis?	54.95971047311787
In that case, I am rather concerned, because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced. Instead, the precautionary principle should come first.	51.19184559307521
My second question concerns the burden of proof.	20.36367060355306
I remember Margot Wallström being introduced as Commissioner in the Committee.	101.97845662533967
At that time, she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof.	46.38728557843891
In other words, a product' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous.	97.92102452485835
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now.	21.92945134212919
. (SV) Thank you, Mrs Schörling.	29.345324278039477
These are two important questions, and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them.	25.135964501771447
No, one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know, of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals.	78.65178216564212
When, on the other hand, the decision has been made to take a certain measure, the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness.	52.1833963210341
It is not, therefore, the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis.	28.550339706601633
The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof.	35.25897336288219
It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases.	23.855560525699037
I have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this.	42.02358228469898
There, however, we are concerned with that particular area, whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern.	69.78802389436035
Therefore, the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context. Instead, it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this.	74.87301268035418
It is, however, perfectly correct that, when it comes, for example, to chemicals, we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof.	46.79757541433541
Mr President, I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work, otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible.	37.38374879881666
I will give an example: a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind. It is therefore a teratogenic substance.	47.045601335577736
Very well, it is a fungicide, it kills off mould.	42.34412058143037
This teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one English laboratory, perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests.	47.58462607633695
Now, in my opinion, given that this is such a serious risk to health, the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market, which New Zealand has done, for example.	69.3612851669971
So I want to put this question to you. When human health is at stake, or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected, should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis?	70.8240809991929
The cost of a baby being born blind is too high; there are no benefits that can compensate for this.	61.33049666627897
In short, Commissioner, I would therefore like to know whether in this case, the precautionary principle as you understand it, would in any case, require the product to be taken off the market, until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary.	53.28416019080324
. (SV) Mr President, no one wants more than I do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people' s health and the environment.	30.31559000299861
Obviously, I cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here, but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case.	75.24125556590985
The truth, of course, is that a great many Member States, and no doubt other nations too, have taken measures to protect their populations' health which amount to using the precautionary principle, even if it has not always been called that.	84.87809002356205
Naturally, it is not in the first place a question of cost; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided.	64.88379398999146
Nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure.	96.94209542029476
I think, however, it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken, it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between.	52.33477959575336
In those circumstances, consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result.	61.023351318831864
I cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it, namely when I was on a visit to Africa.	179.18347522363297
At a hospice for AIDS patients, I met two Irish Catholic nuns who were caring for dying AIDS patients.	113.28708313207994
They were the first to say that, each day, they must think about doing what is most cost-effective because resources had to suffice for their poor patients there. We must be very careful about how we use resources.	119.80230135931461
I believe we can learn something from this.	27.30486823913071
We must, of course, always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help.	40.33218371427506
As is also explained in the present communication, it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis.	79.22263084829146
Consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge, and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people' s health.	43.85163590966477
Mr President, it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions!	46.31312401122366
Commissioner, I would like to come back again to my first question, when I asked about the other Commissioners, for it may have sounded as though I was in jest.	46.25576371773629
Indeed you responded in kind, as I knew you would do.	147.9034387426048
I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill asked, that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union.	28.200541041681557
I have good reason for asking this.	53.23421903789569
As you rightly said, the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where, as yet, there is no scientific evidence.	46.17249839078313
How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time, for example by our partners in the USA, on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes?	73.92503001146136
How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy, will not, as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors, keep pulling the carpet from underneath you?	93.45413840006422
That is exactly what it is all about, otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here, Commissioner!	91.80065795570799
Mr President, I think it is extremely important to point to the present communication' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of repudiating assertions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons.	27.08862100133269
I am certain that we are going to have more conflicts, for example with the United States.	22.046265549528727
We should not be so naïve as to think otherwise.	54.975934896523945
Ever since we signed this protocol in Montreal, we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment, health and trade.	149.08748642681368
This constitutes a good example, therefore.	70.82181834125133
We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too, but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily.	34.966540640355234
We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle, and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it, something which is clearly established in the present communication.	57.28263219206899
Thank you, Commissioner.	17.829155313593716
The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed, so to speak, as more than an ordinary aspect of administration, even though, as we have been able to establish from the interventions, questions and replies, it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance.	81.87497010760718
The debate is closed.	3.77548916318001
Intergovernmental Conference	284.0695311254602
The next item is the report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference [14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)].	5.1374856052652405
Mr President, I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts.	31.74048400930228
Let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration.	102.20672427460329
The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important, both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement.	90.94325916986058
The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twentieth century.	42.345029197434336
For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively, more democratically and with complete transparency, clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work.	71.75012126032925
The first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work.	47.212462247667865
From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit, it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional Europe, one that is more effective, more democratic and more transparent.	61.41108936517545
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union' s institutional bodies.	61.09037215547425
I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows.	156.85423350327605
My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved, namely enlargement.	44.09421321170181
Granted this, the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which, properly addressed, would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union' s institutions.	77.24167066935124
Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which, for that very reason, are highly visible to the European public.	103.55213511065986
In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	58.845642881859064
At the same time, however, I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform, I repeat, of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health, energy, culture, transport and even tourism.	75.98879966321768
Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end.	40.74090863030626
All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference.	71.50986928317391
This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union' s Member States.	54.964192024125296
In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you, so that on 14 February, the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament' s backing.	56.99249746627265
The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us.	18.624826682838297
Mr President, the Group of the European People' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki.	11.980861013856414
It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content, because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and, specifically, the protocol on the Union' s institutions.	46.09749322493905
In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary.	113.1733212226336
The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States.	141.4498595576222
It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform.	135.5856570214402
We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union.	27.298352518796744
Having said this, Mr President, this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference.	37.38132454679024
In theory, we could have done so.	48.8256056360093
We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th.	27.877231697587664
However, we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place, precisely in order to facilitate enlargement.	32.43260882713487
Mr President, I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly.	27.588342296052133
The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues.	61.724748185085296
Mr President, I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself.	11.935970363604705
However, the European Parliament will be reinforced politically by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference. This is for one very simple reason: according to the agreements made in Helsinki, this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues, which are currently decided unanimously, being decided by a qualified majority.	60.29012348172426
Therefore, the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase.	76.6130577197383
It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament.	69.47989073594282
Therefore, since the qualified majority will be extended, there will also be more codecision with Parliament.	79.48743091562963
However, this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union.	43.607627453341635
That it is what we are doing.	28.475846704276346
We believe that, in the political design of the Union, other issues need to be dealt with.	37.72451161304171
These include, amongst others, the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issues, which have made much progress recently, but which must be incorporated into the Treaty.	53.50374154697474
Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and work began on its wording yesterday, which I believe has started very positively.	64.37432112082823
We are going to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see being European as an advantage and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the Union' s institutions.	58.50101550571409
Therefore, Mr President, our proposals, which we will specify in another report, together with the proposals of the Commission, which has produced an excellent document - and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - are going to be used as conference documents.	50.87927944810067
We will talk about this on another day.	35.96927013566454
Today we must give the green light to this conference, and, for its part, the Group of the European People' s Party, Mr President, is ready to give that green light.	31.98033776879583
Mr President, for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee.	23.06497975388539
We are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the IGC precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widened.	38.3396227571644
The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term, because they are very important subjects in themselves.	51.54216533530867
Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC.	66.5096893122222
These first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our Member States during the last IGC.	63.7950074648767
They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study.	150.26704009169072
They need a political deal.	92.76835605178775
It is more a question of nine minutes, perhaps nine hours if it is difficult, locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects, not nine months.	129.18877661086634
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda.	36.06193011610069
There are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at, especially before such a large widening of the Union to so many new countries.	59.06984572657752
Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree.	44.623055958755764
Nobody is asking for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated.	142.59454927272543
However, there are six, seven, eight, nine perhaps, subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address.	103.86204676954536
There is time.	40.56646159405644
Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act.	122.3368653375468
It lasted only five months.	139.0727366833892
The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty lasted a year.	66.53677883225348
Only the Amsterdam Treaty lasted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the British election if you were going to have any outcome from that IGC so that was a different reason.	66.59318197475328
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda.	40.52934854819693
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view.	19.488026159022183
The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles.	110.35421153718485
I thank the Commission for doing that even if, of course, I do not agree with everything the Commission said.	32.83897298058146
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward.	23.870005736279726
Nonetheless the Commission has provided a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who is here with us today for doing that.	46.46911015524601
They have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this IGC.	44.63219576609491
That is all to the good.	58.645748510822884
The Parliament, the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda.	43.25375808337314
I wish you every success, President of the Council, in making sure that the European Council agrees to this agenda and that on Valentine' s Day when you start off the IGC it will be under good auspices and you will bring it to a good conclusion, also when the French Presidency takes over, by the end of this year.	69.21667106790991
We should no longer be worried that the agenda for the IGC will be restricted.	26.752789190893626
That is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner.	56.65429235692562
It makes it impossible for those same Member States, at the IGC, to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights.	54.208057579981286
It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States, especially Britain and France, seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty.	89.0892190244196
It is vital that the IGC prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the Treaty.	40.97192388011863
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court.	51.0170870048014
Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention.	45.18123383186101
Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy.	122.59363237301001
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent.	112.30389807289426
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believes that the European Parliament' s decision to rush headlong into giving its opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference undermines the political significance of the request for talks with the Council, and in the end, makes it rather irrelevant.	30.48164649517289
We would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion, and frankly, we did not appreciate the discourtesy the Portuguese Presidency showed towards the European Parliament by scheduling the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Valentine' s day, the first day of the Strasbourg part-session.	65.85671540678393
Moreover, given that this opinion is quite important, we can still vote for it, and indeed, the majority of our group will be voting for it.	48.0375068085845
I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform.	31.272884357540207
The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States.	80.41071404760226
It is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that, in any case, the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act, and to prevent and rectify the course of events.	43.85074723986789
We must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference, and I firmly hope that this opinion, that was given reluctantly, will not mean that the European Parliament ceases to exert pressure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference is not merely a technical exercise, but rouses the passions that we saw a few hours ago in Parliament.	30.01119739574924
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, to my mind, it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the Council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful.	42.04630195677517
After all, we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance, that is to say, we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States, and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future.	102.596182457672
How, though, is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now, i.e. before enlargement takes place?	120.7401376663327
That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference.	24.17138410262696
We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future.	43.668897615410856
My group, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs.	45.55912682352686
You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand.	31.8560911644603
What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe, and, in particular, a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs, because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns, the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians.	83.7047465371827
The politics of closed doors and private discussions; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all.	93.16084422001558
That is why we need transparency.	35.96217869594164
I believe it falls to you, as President-in-Office of the Council, to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before, leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties.	38.87941767790499
We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going, and its outcome, rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent.	96.19002523600189
We also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda, once the Intergovernmental Conference is over, whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future.	42.60488255293105
In this way, Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy.	84.04413898469987
There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to.	40.859107156015654
As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I wish to make the following point clear: neither my group nor I are content with making a solemn announcement about the Charter.	61.96677523824913
After all, what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals?	87.0201165430318
No, to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union.	92.86652206962849
The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone.	96.91593526483113
What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union.	44.218460940605375
Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens, and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year.	40.31272574299138
Of course, we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States.	77.63736925979808
We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform, as the Council has resolved to do, and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny.	72.4302655638293
We need bold change and, at the same time, we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small States.	46.563733237659704
This is something I would stress, particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States.	53.178656976277594
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will ensue here in the European Parliament, on all the issues you have raised.	32.2750480034275
There is one final issue I would like to raise.	28.563275806085414
Parliament' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy.	72.06976589757242
It is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies, but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making processes.	41.32542737192892
What we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union' s policies to date.	38.692954524479156
It is all about creating a socially just Europe.	90.92999040959128
A socially just Europe is still highly topical, for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union' s policies.	73.73594341812203
Hence, to my mind, that includes having the courage to amend Article 4 of the EC Treaty, which defines the Union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition. The same applies to Article 105, in my view, for the European Central Bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the Treaty, of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment.	61.84819428167238
Mr President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, as set by the Helsinki Council, i.e. focussing strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged Europe, must be adhered to.	33.4049610673964
It must be adhered to in the interests of the fast, effective work of the conference, prior to enlargement.	61.72816246731949
This is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission, which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and, what is more, widen it in the wrong direction, i.e. moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter European system.	80.33460125932046
Our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which, when taken together, form a real alternative resolution.	157.29321384196282
In them we say that the forthcoming IGC must look into a decision-making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty.	65.02434720566531
We deplore the fact that the Commission, in its opinion of 26 January, limits itself to following the routine path of a standardised Europe enlarging towards the East, a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decisions.	72.56664400458355
The federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint, but this is a totally superficial concept.	82.19126523916654
Quite the opposite, in an enlarged Europe, Mr President, the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing exploding.	94.40293237139386
Furthermore, the centralised European system, as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by extrapolation, erodes nations and, in eroding nations, erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves.	105.48153958163505
The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker, as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending.	104.05299347007939
This is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of Europe was clearly recognised, i.e. by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty.	78.32195211890502
We are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles, one which are still, unfortunately, outside the European Parliament and the Commission.	60.19908805875173
A flexible Europe, is a Europe which respects its national democracies, which relies on the support of its nations, its national patriotisms, instead of continually persecuting them.	99.11611274539474
It is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats, not the constraining, convoluted decision making procedures which the Commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	89.20577824684867
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radicals and I would like to say to the President of the Council that he has seen what Parliament' s opinion is.	14.21581121081705
It is no coincidence that the last intervention is the only one that was completely opposed to further European integration. I say this without being the slightest bit ironical about the highly respectable position of Mr Berthu and his group, but it is no coincidence that the European Council' s decision is supported by those who are, after all, in Parliament because - and this is a highly respectable position - they are fighting against further integration.	47.855759703615654
This is the message that Parliament is sending to the Council.	29.53885936530366
I hope that the Portuguese Presidency - and I add my compliments to those already offered - can convey Parliament' s message and convey the result of our mediation work on Saint Valentine' s day. In any case, tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda.	59.09849820465801
This message must be very clear; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow.	49.249465170253735
We shall give an opinion - which is technically and legally necessary - on convening the IGC on 14 February, but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content.	106.73734057371252
Just consider the facts: we looked at Austria a while ago, but we can also look at the stock markets, Mr President: given that the euro, that great undertaking, has fallen 16% against the dollar in a year, then perhaps, I will not say a government, but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues.	144.68277273026376
There is clearly a more ambitious goal.	42.01488651650251
We Radicals have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the House in order to consolidate this text, and for example, to request - just for the sake of mentioning Articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be done, i.e., that the European Parliament should also be involved in drawing up the European Constitution and that a proposal be made for the European Parliament to adopt the amendments to the Treaty.	43.566818057728625
We know that there are other topics: for example, many Members have subscribed, along with us, to the issue of the seat of the institutions, an issue that we believe should be considered at least at IGC level.	42.65846812106961
In conclusion, I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once, so that thanks also to the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, this agenda will be revised.	63.00831349076608
Otherwise, the challenge really would be lost, not just for the present but also for many years to come.	56.33101275050269
Mr President, the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference.	31.640040647375155
He said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but, in the Commission' s draft, plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision-making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market. This means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the Member States to be changed by a majority in Brussels, even if a unanimous French National Assembly, a British House of Commons and a Dutch Lower House should be against this.	80.8964449962861
And, in this regard, you are going to the heart of democracy as it relates to distribution policy and people' s social conditions, which are what voters wish to influence when they go to the polls.	58.954896757546074
These are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day.	77.81638377454485
Brussels knows best.	1511.6163269041422
Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency, but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step, and that is not only my assessment, but also that of the European Ombudsman.	107.29365711204859
Today, the Commission is obliged, on a case-by-case basis, to weigh considerations of confidentiality against people' s demands for, and expectation of, transparency and, if the Commission' s regulation is adopted, the Commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration.	113.5766729878814
There is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of Member States.	55.63896166067793
Under the banner of "progress towards transparency" , a range of documents is being locked away from the general public.	63.750488374623366
It is, of course, thoroughly Orwellian.	23.882774181628854
I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not, at the same time, available for critical scrutiny by the public.	40.60437340354797
Mr Prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism, for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the Commission' s possession. There follows, however, a long, long list of exceptions, and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions.	96.04895023040724
The French text contains the word "refuse" and the English text the word "shall" , which means that the Commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public, for example in my own country.	91.70545520778634
In addition, we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions, which may be used for any purposes whatsoever. It is therefore ...	46.131224410505155
(The President cut the speaker off)	8.491221292876252
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Council Presidency' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered ideas and a high degree of openness.	61.24194932999583
We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve.	66.02650973315357
The preparations the Commission has made so far are on the right track, although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament' s motions are anything to go by.	85.63623743921845
There is more to be said on that score.	52.129291460747666
It is crucially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat trick; that of the power to act, democratic legitimacy and transparency.	61.89168005839925
In the end, it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens.	48.676028073216436
At the same time of course, we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union.	15.557789315107732
If we have been having a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is.	66.45025159082992
The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade.	33.80402285924111
This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union' s being able to function come what may.	85.9855934152966
This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned, and legislation and in relation to treaties, which entail changes being made to legislation.	111.33412979767084
Of course we also want to extend the European Parliament' s corresponding powers in this area.	25.37087967827615
In addition, we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union, for there is a lack of supervision in this area.	24.6417525572948
The Finance Ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting, when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council, which is an unacceptable way to go on.	109.93792473638301
Unlike Mrs Kaufmann, I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank.	45.89602829987295
However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side.	37.05709746839496
Furthermore, the tripartite relationship of Commission, Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy, where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case, especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures, for which the Commission alone has responsibility.	66.98417043722509
The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this.	125.89740617344405
We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference.	35.38062150506485
The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter, perhaps to extend the mandate.	40.74663021847715
There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to.	16.056653071806814
The debates we are having these days, on a certain European country' s government, for example, show, do they not, that we must place the spiritual, moral, constitutional, community and common welfare-orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing, and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason, as this will be a crucial stabilising factor.	105.75168079609936
I would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights.	48.30386128790999
The European Union needs few, if any, new instruments, and it does not need any new competences.	118.22506760579547
What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice.	95.3314886626191
For this reason, we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out, on behalf of the citizens, the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty.	38.257579872047394
In my view, that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on.	30.50917325860125
If we succeed in making progress here, then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union.	45.96229990367602
This is the crux of the matter.	12.729279104883364
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage.	20.907131534086677
, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. (IT) Mr President-in-Office, on listening to the various interventions, you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament' s political groups, the decision prevailed - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency, instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference.	47.28306965759247
I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this, last week in the Committee I chair, but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager.	36.03970296980256
You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries, and therefore in their parliaments.	78.86253699686772
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments, which were represented by competent and exacting delegations.	48.028471214545924
The aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging.	97.86090319960805
We need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the Union' s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference table.	99.2394966770881
However, we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference.	38.509469751472324
Yesterday, we also discussed the Commission, represented by Commissioner Barnier, who gave its opinion.	67.01036680237569
This effort was appreciated, even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals, and moreover, Mr President-in-Office, you also expressed different views.	162.75788013713435
Nevertheless, we must stress that many people are aware, as they were yesterday too, of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political Europe, a risk that was, moreover, indicated in an interview that surely escaped no one' s attention, owing to the authority of the person being interviewed - Jacques Delors.	81.47764076534251
We must, therefore, ensure that at the Intergovernmental Conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic bases of the Union and how to strengthen - and this has been discussed in the House even today, with regard to the situation in Austria - the system of principles, values and rights underpinning the Union and the role of the political institutions of the Union, with regard, among other things, to running the economy.	51.619334072725366
We are counting on the Portuguese Presidency, we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the Commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference.	45.07078323687828
Mr President, only a strengthened Europe can cope with enlargement.	94.15935681878868
Only a strengthened Europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction.	88.52351836574218
That is why sweeping reforms are necessary and, hence, a widened IGC agenda.	126.71221207998077
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and, unfortunately, turned a deaf ear to this Parliament.	68.99391593162676
Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor' s book.	102.8293140913785
It is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament and the Commission join forces for this IGC.	36.80906415695705
In many ways, they share the same interests and the same insights.	51.08266563138094
An essential component of this joint effort should, in any case, be this Parliament' s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the Treaty.	60.87652412820864
Of all priorities, this one is the most pressing.	97.78603658931127
What is the Commission' s verdict on this?	15.909805017456645
It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and, therefore, not only within the working party, but also at the same political level as the Commission.	47.491143975530434
There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission.	82.7840530584609
Not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new Member States, but we owe them to ourselves.	66.12083982877562
If we allow Europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement, we will drown in our own political quagmire.	28.03373465637894
Mr President, there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament. It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation.	49.14947810401009
After having restricted, on its own initiative, its participation in the IGC to two minor seats, Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC.	108.13362481943865
The fact is, whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way, you will admit - in rushing to give its opinion, Parliament is giving up the only lever which the Treaty accords it, i.e. demanding a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion.	185.3773565516097
Why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow, 3 February, as a matter of urgency, when we could wait, in a position of strength, until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February, and thus force an agenda that is complete, and therefore consistent, on the Council.	82.80556946351084
A good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today.	79.90655939736449
Hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly, in our resolution, that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues, since in our haste, with blameworthy naivety, we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda.	103.11095143254937
If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC, then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this.	51.2167256046331
Whether we want it or not, since Parliament itself is going to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates, the venue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union.	51.123006408128354
I therefore invite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority, those who last November ruled that the future of Europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the Amsterdam leftovers, to take up their pilgrims' staffs and go and convince their own governments that this IGC must be extended, since this is permitted according to the resolution of the Helsinki Council.	84.81008212472862
Because of the situation in Austria, this is a dark day for Europe.	38.25957749280391
It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive, and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing.	76.88750121857571
In order to assert our fundamental values, they need to be laid down in writing, as a matter of urgency, and, beyond this IGC, I believe we owe Europe a constitution.	48.629385645939095
Mr President, the draft resolution we are now discussing requires, precisely as before, that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions.	81.93906150683887
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this.	31.220802621866536
I am convinced that this is an error of judgement.	24.387729448809804
A federal and centralist EU which intervenes more and more in the government of the Member States is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement.	84.65699103606732
A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries.	193.9790693344382
Paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level.	51.3845105939328
It is not, however, possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union.	29.187914591891644
This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank. This is untenable.	71.4364246219717
If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic, the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered.	75.86469000243301
The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity. Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible.	50.465054130233106
The rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re-examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective.	42.53271166504724
Article 56 of the Treaty, prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital, must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control.	68.25006501656186
In the majority of EU countries, there are now governments dominated by social democrats.	107.70152325573143
It is remarkable that, now they have the opportunity to do so, none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union.	49.60564856597202
It also, of course, damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital.	46.67050911450147
The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference.	41.89617125775718
It is, however, important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States.	21.33879141232197
It is the Member States' parliaments, or people voting in referenda, who are to direct the development of the Treaty.	41.24805727674713
It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification.	47.87877860735415
Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text, which I shall vote for, even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it.	45.476736028526155
Nevertheless, the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right.	77.94130766218922
The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values, whether it comes down to an economic free trade area, or whether, on the other hand, it has a greater ambition: the desire to be a supranational union, in ways that have yet to be defined, that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world.	98.45824120590939
This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution.	56.46192261369098
The amendment of the Treaties was, however, limited to a review of some internal rules, which was necessary and important, but did not answer the fundamental question: what is Europe, what are its common principles and therefore, its objectives and limitations?	127.4904595096945
However, politics exacts its revenge, and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda, it comes back in, as a matter of fact, through a door, and through the front door in the case of Austria, since a party is entering the Austrian Government which seems to represent a return to intolerance, xenophobia and forms of racism.	102.39218647419794
And it is not a question of links with the past; it is a question of prospects for the future, and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this.	65.18680433859474
I belong to a world, the world of Liberal Catholics, which is not left-wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common European values, and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values.	107.55648869225851
The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in a European Constitution, then we shall construct a Europe without a solid, lasting base.	61.91163355706778
Commissioner Barnier, I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values: make the most of the chances you were given by the December Conference to include these subjects and principles, because this is the only way we will build a lasting Europe.	77.1477701283052
Mr President, I am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of Nordic sceptics and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which, looked long and hard at, threatens the whole of democratic Europe.	78.49846504614699
I am thinking of the contributions from Mr Bonde and Mr Sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively unconscious but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist EU.	68.97736978800334
They rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles.	162.77503263100584
I might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country, Denmark, takes it for granted that, when we enlarge the circle of EU countries to include the envisaged huge number of new Member States and when we in that way extend the breadth of the Union, we cannot at the same time pursue further integration in depth, that is to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a United States of Europe.	81.71525308396812
However, that is precisely what is happening.	28.36015049488954
With every single geographical extension to the area covered by the EU, we have seen how extensions in breadth have been followed by intensive extensions in depth, and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the Committee is contemplating, especially in paragraph 7 which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth.	65.80661539833844
In the light of developments in recent days, it might well be asked what we really are to do about these intergovernmental conferences and treaty amendments when government leaders - in reality the European Council of Ministers - make decisions in relation to an independent Member State entailing intervention in that Member State' s democratic process.	100.30746586718584
You can think what you like about Mr Haider, and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician, but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country' s democratic process.	90.36591495616915
When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty, we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time, sometimes in contravention of the Treaty, as we have just seen.	48.77985494139067
I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon.	29.038320159742042
On 14 February, we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000.	35.49255878773648
This is a big task but it can be done.	23.695996061325868
I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement.	104.943675892705
In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important "Amsterdam leftovers" .	42.61757152878515
These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe.	159.0075374989652
In relation to the latter point, Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining.	44.409607854907236
We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission.	51.06638482778308
I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point.	109.15012496692387
At the IGC, we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution.	70.2623691673966
We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty.	95.37077211727171
In other words, if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions.	51.38747542678828
So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully.	158.429321204137
We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents.	26.59581442430957
The Treaty of Amsterdam, Mr President, has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe.	82.76601517163111
Mr President, I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen resolution, which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible.	38.62745632643671
In any case, this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon.	42.76127389038833
I think that, under the present rules of the Treaties, the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation.	34.23023871935721
On the contrary, we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms, in collaboration with the Commission whose own proposals are worthy of note.	58.749364413530856
We must use dialogue at every political level, including of course dialogue with the national parliaments.	82.18914890654894
That way, we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms.	49.001314958410276
Parliament' s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that, with the Union' s institutional changes, we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union.	40.21382201493962
They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone.	46.181305935877305
The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive.	73.3418367403718
It may be easy to come up with solutions, but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term.	65.37092271522549
I will mention two point that may create tension.	122.98867823054911
One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries.	40.599881743626575
Europe is not, nor can it become a classic federal state.	82.34810370337927
The solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union, which is a union of states and peoples.	47.05566365275513
The other area of conflict is more difficult.	63.777062289548766
Owing to the imminent increase in membership, the bodies of the future European Union must become more effective.	53.1185428474252
This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly.	55.40431603047842
By its very nature, however, the European Union is, and will remain, a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution.	62.15267444820113
Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist.	294.4950524783454
Of course they do, but they are not unlimited.	37.61991913090203
If the limits are exceeded because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness, then the legitimising basis of the European Union will suffer.	57.36778004221257
I am, however, optimistic.	39.64865591620102
Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened.	30.194528205985964
The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union.	23.91426620080139
It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union, which will, however, be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as planned.	53.468239830215516
The Commission' s former president, Jacques Delors, has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Confederation.	37.35220125440642
He has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions, for the sake of clarity.	33.20552583452661
The Commission' s current President, Mr Prodi, and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have put forward ideas along the same lines.	45.87043007105855
Last November, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for Europe: the onion skin model.	30.958650938977538
In the next resolution on the IGC, Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility.	67.51658400624859
Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings, as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party.	31.955742303110164
My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken, somewhat sceptically, about some aspects of the matter in hand.	70.6434650263523
I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions.	60.782922196678136
This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about.	30.836704724568456
May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament.	43.555632545330866
A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly.	174.9515047105492
If you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality, six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants, you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 367,000 people has more Members in this Chamber than Wales, which is a partly self-governing region of the United Kingdom.	118.5938773291081
Scotland, with a population of 5 million, has eight seats in this House at the moment; Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen.	55.9302595172085
Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700, bring in 26% more population over time, and then adopt the Commission' s, I think ill-considered, proposition, that there should be a European list of candidates.	105.3419558125133
What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here?	78.32408091640812
It will become totally invisible!	49.25443228143437
Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions, people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones.	78.01128417274636
A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view.	167.60254664142172
Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new. It has been said many times.	37.4726990419176
This time, however, it is true.	55.137180784540256
We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement.	37.13545034132642
The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not.	77.89189346842618
Will we enlarge with or without deep reform?	259.05371814703284
That is the debate, and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda or its method.	51.53812254123676
It is clear that the Council, for the moment, has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place.	38.86430193938222
That puts enlargement in danger. It jeopardises any prospect of political union and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand.	73.73640050002905
The Council must realise that, if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations, the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further.	53.07176832006767
The Council is consulting us and Parliament is giving its opinion.	63.56875148303774
We want an Intergovernmental Conference, but not this one.	76.15689498060732
Must there be an IGC?	204.54810200170715
Of course there must, but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference.	65.46509659343711
The agenda must go much further. We must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic.	46.13575603195078
Being much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes, more - its ability to take the initiative.	125.24283775643019
We must clearly set firm objectives.	125.53383466959804
The functionalist approach is over, for better or for worse.	130.11233458848608
The functionalist approach has brought us to this point.	30.19944547997664
Have we achieved results?	468.50939740529947
Yes, but the point is to make a qualitative leap and, speaking in political terms, this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment.	88.7017448147772
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, at this stage, following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest, I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi.	33.05892226385755
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus, if this opinion were adopted, the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February, as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency.	82.70790229511861
As far as we are concerned, after producing the opinion expected from the Commission, according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated.	83.27740923710714
We know, I know myself, that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us.	60.82679013919814
I would just like to make a few comments, after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups.	32.95267248051406
Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda.	34.96004697518505
I understand this anxiety, this fear that the agenda may be too limited, and yet I feel, as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki, that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate.	41.35154540850662
Indeed, it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate, which the Commission framed for its own opinion, but using all the terms thereof, plus everything between the lines.	88.67818891074538
We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers, which is, in any case, an incorrect label.	48.97355275348687
I do not like the term 'leftovers' any more than Richard Corbett does.	116.73543168934204
It gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects, and difficult, so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth.	77.86426490821289
As far as we are concerned - I am responding to Mr Seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects, even though I do consider them as priorities, and consider that they must be dealt with now.	57.16355570553858
They are the first but they are not the only subjects, Mr Seguro, that the conference must deal with.	54.98193836049576
We have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference, if the Portuguese Presidency firstly, and then the French Presidency, so wish, in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement.	76.64334869513338
We are ready for it, whether it is a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on which work has started, the CFSP and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations, or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work: reorganisation of the Treaties.	54.010059317955516
I have heard many comments on the Commission' s opinion, which mentioned all these subjects and dealt with many of them in depth, with specific indications of new draft articles, but no one has said that we were going beyond the Helsinki mandate.	73.1397669758816
This proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate, by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers.	66.35617928702293
As regards the participation of the European Parliament in the conference proceedings, I think that Mr Seixas da Costa will agree with me, on the basis of our shared experience, in saying that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Brok, are going to be working.	53.060685190549954
Of course, the final trade-offs will be made, as in any institutional negotiations, and I think this is no bad thing, at Council level, especially at the level of the Council of Heads of State and Government, who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands.	73.67018832402391
Let me point out, in passing, that the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is also a Council member, and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role, alongside the Heads of State and Government, particularly during the final period.	73.30117544858061
However, these Council proceedings must be carefully prepared.	150.3619384954375
This preparatory work, this fine-tuning, must not be omitted, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful, and that it will not just be limited to technical details.	52.74840289096773
I think that all of us, the personal representatives of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, your two representatives, and myself, as a representative of the Commission, will be going into matters in detail, but it will be afterwards, at a different level, one in which we will also be participating, that the last trade-offs must be made.	48.83571101017225
Throughout this conference, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important, but the quality of what they will be saying.	36.90335081110142
And once again I should like to point out in this House, in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam, that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament, prior to Amsterdam, the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations.	57.54270844564559
I am sure that the situation will be just the same and, as far as I am concerned, in my current position, I shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations.	50.85133830012974
I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be.	35.16599535325698
We now await, therefore, with great interest, ladies and gentlemen of the House, your next opinion, in which you will specify Parliament' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations.	98.1656708701343
It is extremely important that the two European institutions involved in these negotiations, the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other, alongside the Council members, explain clearly to the citizens of the Union continually, every day, what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as European institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged Union and the common interest.	84.72269460326532
In the coming months, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Commission will therefore be working in close cooperation, on good terms, with your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok, in order to reconcile our points of view, if need be.	79.02455334053131
Quite probably, our points of view and our positions will not always be the same. There will probably be differences of opinion, that would be only normal.	112.46305624138658
The important thing is that we are consistent, and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since I accepted the position of Commissioner.	86.94475382500156
Our concern and our ambition, therefore, on a large number of subjects, is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully.	89.27058506327754
This will not be a matter of chance, since, let me repeat, I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union.	61.09378047920437
Finally, I should like to make three additional comments, quite briefly, Mr President.	36.84498414364728
Firstly, to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate.	49.029887790032944
Such dialogue between the national parliaments, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important.	48.77855239612676
I have said, furthermore, that I would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments.	51.27847729129661
Tomorrow, I shall be in London.	132.32658288009523
In a fortnight' s time, I shall be in Berlin.	65.59017433941379
In three weeks' time, I shall be in Paris, and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another.	86.31040125373116
I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive, and I should like to thank you for taking it.	35.94703153772378
My second brief comment is to thank the Portuguese Presidency, particularly Mr Seixas da Costa, for his proactive approach.	38.515327913018936
Indeed, the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own: the Portuguese Presidency cannot be just an interim presidency.	140.20607814185817
It will have to initiate these negotiations.	50.946733675566904
We are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency, in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000.	36.742690018605494
Not only that a conclusion can be reached, but that a successful conclusion can be reached, which is not necessarily the same thing.	51.405549904794825
Concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully.	197.20317131793848
The handover will have been made, but the conditions in which the handover is going to be made, by yourself, Mr President, and by the Portuguese Presidency, are going to be extremely important, as is the nature of this handover.	27.692648813762318
It is all the work which is going to be carried out together, under your guidance particularly, in the course of these few months, which is extremely important.	38.76341548731323
We have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency' s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion, and indeed great expectations thereof. Portugal is a small country, but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions.	72.81068946324064
After having heard Prime Minister Guterres, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and yourself, I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations.	61.8063894451502
It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months.	26.120783854604635
Finally, let me repeat, we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations.	24.891144801479204
These are difficult subjects, subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain.	109.00994883329597
All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament, Ministers, Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens, to public debate.	75.27168611476996
As far as the Commission is concerned, it will, ladies and gentlemen, be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate.	48.92718515559343
Cross-border services	73.19817230304572
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	8.287329113573406
A5-0007/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the posting of workers who are third-country nationals for the provision of cross-border services (COM(1999)3 - C4-0095/1999 - 1999/0012(COD));	9.634044573829026
A5-0012/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a Council directive extending the freedom to provide cross-border services to third-country nationals established in the Community (COM(1999)3 - C4-0096/1999 - 1999/0013(CNS)).	11.32922384883445
- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to apologise for being a little hoarse today, but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of explaining and talking to do.	57.536974084562345
I would first like to say how indebted I am to the Commission for seizing the initiative, and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today.	30.262678142314858
It has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country nationals in the European Union who are here as workers or on a self-employed basis.	64.03076984451208
The current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees, I refer in particular to those relating to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst.	71.79635808219169
These have, in fact, clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third-country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross-border services and this without having to obtain work permits.	81.6054459974976
However, the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue.	50.31713573535226
Furthermore, not all Member States have abided by the Court of Justice' s verdicts with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement, and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross-border services; barriers that are often impossible to overcome, especially for the smaller companies.	80.95177964658681
The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services.	79.88153003041936
There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here.	19.600016066804702
Both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU enterprises.	153.96275755917637
It is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement.	92.01856031212515
All provisions, i.e. issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights, should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services.	83.6165043466687
I, together with the European Parliament' s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, are therefore of the opinion that the Commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view, as expressed in the report produced by the Council' s Legal Service, is inappropriate.	39.98483134984245
Consequently, I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned.	45.77805626010811
I also believe that Parliament' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directives as opposed to the Commission' s proposal.	23.511043014565995
Many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the Council, and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by dint of extant law and economic good sense.	102.85741374612877
When it comes to acceptance by the Council, I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible, even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposals.	42.28197717593518
I am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis.	22.365148819584753
Turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments, one of the essential differences is that, in place of a "service provision card plus notification for each individual contract" system, provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract.	105.64447836346972
This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms.	22.525029719158322
However, in order to compensate for this, all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued, and as the Commission' s proposal would have it, more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued.	49.83890149407116
An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection, not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter.	100.14635935241728
This should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident.	104.62629607373326
Likewise, the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued, namely under the terms of an opposition procedure.	100.34013930075632
What we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States, rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual Member States.	46.437855452790565
I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs.	44.578171473842914
I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months, and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting.	43.96164573418179
However, we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months.	84.6925623619296
When it comes to self-employed persons, in addition to the amendments already described, we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent, and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment.	52.38601266053966
I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	15.465484655011151
Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee' s amendments, which they adopted unanimously.	51.292086347371225
I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions.	135.35297938805212
I must say I have received extremely contradictory statements from Parliament' s services as to exactly how these Council decisions should be quoted; whether or not one should use the number or date alone, or both, and how extensively to quote from them.	207.9039485303916
Two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report.	106.7227852158078
I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons.	112.27102277334167
I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology, i.e. the correct way to quote.	65.01616213028228
This would make our rapporteur' s life considerably easier in the future.	86.65895372141875
There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio' s reports.	46.684075040729546
Unfortunately I have to say that I am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolved on unanimously, and I would like to stand by this outcome, which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions.	41.324481518784616
On a final note, I would like to thank all those in the Committee who supported me in compiling these reports, which were far from easy to produce.	51.88533156235427
I would like to single Mr Wieland out for special mention, for he has the dubious honour of being the shadow rapporteur and was involved to a far greater extent than is customary in the drawing up of this report, contributing excellent and constructive ideas; and this without being in a position to receive the plaudits awarded a rapporteur.	124.2785604390912
That is why he deserves special mention!	76.17592612328156
.	785.4324778346265
(NL) Mr President, I am pleased I have been given the opportunity to make a few introductory remarks at the end of rapporteur Mrs Berger' s speech, after which I will, of course, listen with all due attention to the next speakers. If you allow me, Mr President, I would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate.	33.37128879269156
May I say how the Commission welcomes the European Parliament' s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third-country employees, the topic of the debate.	52.81513665366506
I am extremely grateful for the work that Mrs Berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge.	49.533486003509665
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	20.15329706069503
The Commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by Parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards.	44.61419458038944
If the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more, or all, Member States, the procedure would be more flexible still.	116.01370870083854
The Commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card.	49.74396751191436
However, I do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a Member State.	37.52093894235754
The Commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is terminated at short notice.	48.442673411754974
An efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross-border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market.	70.45299536238659
It seems over the top to us for other Member States to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards.	111.5943002979226
Indeed, it should be possible for a third-country subject who has legal status in a Member State to be admitted to other Member States too.	41.34863711265661
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification.	99.62396614111115
Neither does the Commission accept the proposal that legal status in a Member State should be valid three months after the card has expired.	79.26325077450899
Following completion of the service, it is not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service is provided.	75.34961279568608
That is why the Commission supports Mrs Palacio' s Amendment No 22 in both respects.	36.627386392419034
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the Commission appreciates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal.	45.26155688590015
These are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments.	58.62326938455233
I hope that, at the end of the debate, when all the speakers have contributed, I will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments.	31.76725404653195
Mr President, tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as well as the amended version.	25.021557872122504
I propose to confine my comments to two areas.	64.51109441365554
Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve, that is achieve in the real sense.	51.72564056262131
There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account.	21.27088911826361
My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment.	77.2359251380462
Then there are the interests of the Member States, which, being on the receiving end, may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario.	96.32896482687231
If we are going to abide by the one extreme, that is the interests of the Member States, then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high.	45.29341291074318
There is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card.	62.8463706855651
If I were to go to the other extreme, as few hurdles as possible that is, then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive.	58.29108920347804
I would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place, but with the hurdles facing the business world being so high, in reality no one would apply for the card. Alternatively, I might have no directive at all.	70.51513918026073
Neither outcome would be satisfactory.	263.1673511236439
Perhaps this is also why, as is rumoured to be the case, the Council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well.	59.12874346764966
We have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other, that of finding the easiest possible solution.	85.78823582774855
We want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis-à-vis the business world, but once these have been overcome, implementation is as easy as it possibly could be.	103.41835917742323
Therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more Member States.	54.497879505436444
If a company in France says that it has an employee who has to work in Denmark on a permanent basis, and only in Denmark, then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for Denmark.	87.83663327838097
Accordingly, the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance.	92.43854950571433
In return for this, however, we want early notification obligations to be discontinued, rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other Member State along with them, and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his/her posting.	105.87575186898809
Consequently, I too have to say that I am in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	9.628329198058545
Perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission.	16.06174922042792
We want to achieve a completely flexible solution.	22.987254472993424
If a particular Member State was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a theft and the card was for their country, then this particular Member State would be able to revoke this card, as it were, for the reasons cited in this directive, which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution.	117.79644491070769
Allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter.	49.43518522494142
Most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers.	60.381584493180455
We all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty, some of them very old, which are still referred to as EC.	57.55478265292709
We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law.	49.38802730675795
However, before the elections we - the Council, the Commission, Parliament, the press, unions and companies that is - worked towards making the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens.	129.2285160175549
We have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU.	90.55424110421728
They have now got to grips with "EU" .	38.946095227314125
We would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to christen the product we are proposing to deliver "EC service provision card" and not "EU service provision card" .	147.2726643911934
It is the world of the EU that the citizens are interested in, this is the one that counts in their eyes.	38.81656519692392
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction.	13.061662410972597
Mr President it is later than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this session so I shall be very brief indeed.	51.855366673681985
One of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this Parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism.	116.99477863997875
This directive is, of course, not in itself directly about that.	52.0585958979283
It is about attending to the needs of the internal market, creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self-employed.	61.66208845907129
That is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger.	104.71703488328204
We welcome that, and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision, we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law.	95.8311451448143
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally, which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive, which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council.	18.675913577934654
Nevertheless, I have tabled an amendment.	47.224845832440536
Mrs Berger, in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6, you mention legal security.	246.00081627698327
The first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit, since all that does is create legal insecurity.	94.22524622532585
You rightly raise the concern, also expressed by Mr Wieland, at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire, but I think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit.	105.8488969932827
If the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date, it must end on that date.	62.02903471057324
Legal security requires this.	382.1731343974589
On the other hand, with regard to point d of Amendment No 10, which refers to the first directive, you suggest that, for reasons of public security or public order regulations, a Member State may reject the validity of the card.	95.0548268431115
There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive.	50.29452733814245
It makes no sense for any worker within the Schengen area, since he or she will already have undergone a screening process in order to enter the first Member State, and the second Member State would be justified in rejecting ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory.	89.57494979109637
It therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity.	43.14207377546293
In the case of a non-Schengen state, in the last paragraph of Amendment No 22, that possibility is contemplated, and is perfectly expressed, and I believe this provides greater legal security.	84.73275453377717
The discretional power of the State, which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 10, seems to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report.	81.4638496264668
I would therefore ask Members to examine my amendment carefully, and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result.	43.458335034739015
On the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court cases Mrs Berger referred to in her opening remarks.	186.51813996900543
However, in the case of the United Kingdom, we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable.	32.8539384136429
Partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the United Kingdom.	47.557020213651384
Under the arrangements contained in the Treaties, the United Kingdom retains its border controls.	86.93036891931645
Under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation, third country nationals wishing to move to the UK under the procedures described, will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another Member State, thereby by-passing UK border controls.	135.00747956945077
If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements, that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process.	47.222098647872286
For that reason, we shall vote against both these proposals.	32.96420002489087
Mr President, Commissioner, first and foremost I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to Mr Wieland for the efforts they have expended in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner.	26.919552426256015
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services.	48.342387946960244
The new regulation for cross-border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises.	69.52522817355471
The strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the EU service provision card - and I am with Mr Wieland on this - are essential, for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts.	52.42195813804498
Why do I think we need the directive so much?	45.07659704206065
Three reasons and they are as follows: on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU, in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market.	36.12365514567471
Therefore, whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions, I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible.	38.61908579505491
My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission. Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations?	151.32064669630128
How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view, as this will have important implications, notably for the accession negotiations and for our country, which shares common borders with so many applicant countries?	118.65689072761246
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms, namely the free movement of people and services, did not apply to them.	36.80486070985678
Indeed, they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided.	72.29431578937096
There are approximately thirteen million third-country subjects who reside within European territory.	111.30557198238117
I assume that, although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known, their number will most definitely not be low.	89.8746094114757
So, up to now, their access to the entire territory of the Union has not been regulated by Community legislation.	62.17404618584681
The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card.	37.03269412438746
It seems important, in this respect, to underline that the service provision card will be issued in a flexible manner, namely within five days of a simple declaration' s having been submitted to a Member State where the service will be provided; and that, also to prevent misuse, this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extended.	65.7358623482071
I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner.	30.54724704786696
Having also studied the amendments submitted, I concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow.	74.58267525763942
May I, to finish off, thank Mrs Berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having, in that way, added an important degree of meaning to her report?	114.89405564153763
I think that, with this report, we are, once again, one step closer to the realisation of the internal market.	26.079203625492664
Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail.	19.70978752777677
In the course of my speech, I would also like to address Lord Inglewood regarding the remark he has just made.	31.441320842563034
Regarding the first proposal on third-country employees, the Commission is prepared to adopt Amendments Nos 2, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 22.	45.3142593735202
Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too, provided the situation of posting is established in the Member State in which the service provider is established.	63.90436912501672
The Commission also agrees with Amendment No 11, except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three months, as I explained just now.	52.61551437673385
We also welcome Amendment No 13 insofar as, as a result of this, the card' s area of applicability is extended from one Member State to all Member States.	35.94889994223846
In terms of comitology, Amendments Nos 14 and 21 also apply in part, insofar as the rights of Parliament are concerned.	69.93593261417892
I regret that the Commission has found Amendment No 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three-month period and the role of the Member State in which the service is provided are concerned.	30.553860756085214
In this respect, the Commission supports Amendment No 22, as I have already mentioned.	20.348547800495346
The other amendments are unacceptable.	53.48995377860998
Personally, I am rather in favour of the term "EU service provision card" which is proposed in Amendment No 1, but the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this.	39.00850641553199
As Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96/71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force, no change is necessary.	89.90264131403251
Acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued.	91.43574124508066
Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States.	51.386311525726256
Amendment No 19 is also unacceptable, given my thoughts on Amendment No 10.	46.400625362563275
The Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal.	32.53265171533548
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable.	28.371072560159718
As far as Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term "self-employed" is concerned, the Commission will, as I have already remarked, provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged.	88.10291426207102
I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood' s remark.	34.03524750425875
He referred to United Kingdom border controls and I would like to say to him that Member States, and this includes the United Kingdom, are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders.	67.88900214835648
This applies, as already stated, to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium, where it was recently of relevance.	50.81273832400874
With regard to the remark made by Mr Karas, I am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from Poland being used as employees in his country.	29.773928475722446
The Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non-EU countries.	45.411012968238076
The question is, furthermore, one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way.	42.429585415253136
In my opinion, this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate.	16.500717327741356
On behalf of the Commission, I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point.	38.23429111752805
I will keep myself free in this connection.	108.83320435134512
Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and, in particular, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs Berger.	19.2555657712517
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.	6.462942405759551
The debate is closed.	3.77548916318001
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.	6.171391594551628
Court of First Instance	171.7240461199816
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report, which, on reading it, gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the Council' s draft decision.	32.48321906287171
However, this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results, such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency' s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation, composition and competences of the Community Courts.	52.55566092587654
For this reason, I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marinho.	11.380186288394103
Mr President, the reform of the Community judicial system has become an essential requirement if, in the future, we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales, and if, in the future, the European Union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon.	49.683329324083104
Today - and I must say this with pride and satisfaction - this Parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we Europeans believe that the European political project is much more than just an internal market, and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests.	49.779049560007735
Behind these principles, Mr President, lies the justice system.	252.6439010080261
However, justice delayed is justice denied, and we must reflect on this notion.	80.39227326778285
The working document prepared by the Court itself contains alarming information.	233.96757849956953
For this reason, the draft reform, which has been drawn up by the rapporteur, Vice-President Marinho, is to be welcomed.	25.811143870448998
It is true that it is a stopgap solution, but we must rely on stopgap solutions because, at the moment - as he himself has pointed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference.	36.855632530934905
We have to offer solutions which, while provisional, help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice.	69.20587924789363
I would like to make two observations during this intervention, which stem from the report itself, given this Parliament' s obligation, in accordance with the Treaty, to produce a very succinct report, which does not go into depth.	33.13955730243263
These are two of Vice-President Marinho' s ideas and, I believe, they are seconded by the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	19.545404079362296
The first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance, and that they should be given one more référendaire.	39.29810092327451
The second is that the translation services of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separated.	21.726903655445952
At the moment, the Court of First Instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated.	39.024301611376174
According to the Treaty, one of the founding principles of this Community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our overlooking the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language.	52.45676514713468
Since we are talking about the Intergovernmental Conference, let us consider just two points.	45.45332226052512
The first concerns this Parliament.	46.52290814109121
I believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice, even in the appointment of judges.	34.259655885481386
Above all, we wish to see an extension of the competences of the Court of Justice, hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations, in other words, its resources.	55.14630467478929
We wish to see its competences extended, especially within Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community and with regard to Chapter VI of the Treaty on European Union and also a review of certain possible options, certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens.	56.9472943041845
And I refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days.	35.62759913221119
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report.	7.840112751202191
It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency.	46.65497824464194
Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice.	162.94378218308057
The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT.	35.68928698275716
The decision could have huge implications for our local economy.	50.0043663529478
Secondly there is a lady within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age.	183.89273170151162
These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe' s system of justice. Delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy.	237.22033012798553
This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect, but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court.	53.35393773148176
Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references.	106.47006287041307
This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff, rather of the Court' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union.	66.47982115846963
The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative, but Europe is a legal construction, its courts are central to its proper functioning.	129.7579356169146
In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system.	130.65895634787933
Otherwise we will all, as elected representatives, be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice.	98.80476648056607
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report.	5.2981480001290375
I also fully endorse his findings, in which, in particular, he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service.	62.35589885345908
In point of fact, I consider this to be necessary because we heard, following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market' s visit to Luxembourg, that it is of course inevitable, a God-given fact as it were, that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service, and so more often than not, important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve.	68.94807015565881
However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here.	41.51607310760616
For example, I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance, if applicable, and making this a final competence, in those spheres where benches of the Court, which resemble courts, pass judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law.	140.64902528368935
I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level.	34.97961498722503
It seems to me that we need to give this some thought, as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions.	35.74508144672233
We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind.	18.9691073606558
Where possible, one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance.	78.26270514033321
In addition, we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs, not to mention groups, lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases, when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance.	59.60912158021653
On a final note, I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law.	126.06873551088172
As things stand, OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases.	85.05011258124742
It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court.	33.762694812306805
The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance.	68.11595226747676
That would be another way of spurring the reform process on.	58.05624804283355
Mr President, I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work.	16.663178876652637
The European Union is a system based on law.	20.144630848037743
It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law.	53.020610411781924
Furthermore, if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them, what happens, as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out, is that justice delayed becomes, as we know, justice denied.	96.06443177942676
The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem.	67.8494227356748
However, as Mr Marinho has pointed out, more is necessary, but that has to wait for the IGC,	52.56698948904306
In my own country, mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges.	28.95916366798008
There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system.	44.47210025269674
The extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding Anglo/French dispute over British beef which has caused such anger in my country and such frustration with the workings of the Union' s disputes resolution procedures.	107.65382401544191
This has been compounded, so some who advise me believe, by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well nigh impossible for non-French nationals to proceed against the French Government.	76.56799055052224
Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible.	64.34937005394933
This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable.	133.0217891857766
What is happening in France, Mr President, appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties.	74.79154882838242
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner, who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate, to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings.	54.928585573203144
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this.	26.556409362210005
Mr President, on behalf of Commission President, Mr Prodi, I would like to respond as follows.	31.539854982809796
The Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. The purport of this request is, on the one hand, to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the Court of First Instance, such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and, on the other hand, to increase the number of judges at the Court of First Instance.	28.427121823695483
May I add that, on behalf of the Commission, I listened with great interest to the pleas which have been made just now and that I have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlies these pleas.	26.613238681547134
The unease is justified.	66.16348060899504
It has been said more than once: justice delayed is justice denied.	84.64007870162898
The Commission sympathises with these considerations.	44.207002725074666
In the light of this sympathy, I would like to continue my response as follows.	34.55583124695185
As your Parliament is aware, the Commission is convinced that, without fundamental reform, the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines.	101.5600058670437
Consequently, the Commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the entirety of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades.	43.63712294326059
The Commission is aware of the request made by the Court of First Instance to increase its number of judges, but at the moment, the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which I have just mentioned.	26.010593930014878
In other words, once this study is complete, the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible.	48.07951198613828
Thank you, Commissioner.	17.829155313593716
The debate is closed.	3.7754896132534173
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	5.224258125996437
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo	165.1757217798833
The next item is the report (A5-0022/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(99)0598 - C5-0045/00 - 1999/0240(CNS)).	6.772156031839804
I have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes.	22.128183424405474
I propose that we start the debate immediately.	54.305114697739874
He will join us and speak as soon as he arrives.	60.52782404339144
I therefore give the floor immediately to Mr Bourlanges, in his capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.	23.86572075813392
Mr President, this is an important and urgent matter, and Parliament is complying with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quickly, because today, you must realise, men and women are dying in Kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero, these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid.	49.78230156680065
An urgent request has been referred to us, and we approve it.	51.27886851652323
We have been asked for EUR 35 million.	26.325714466804463
We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring, once the decision has been taken, that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible.	39.38770878374226
We are talking about macrofinancial aid.	26.28999383082776
There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration.	50.692823357389514
This is not our opinion.	28.385423036972586
Our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in Kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region.	43.035458949935055
Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state.	50.24590276382432
The second important problem is that we have been asked for payments, the donors have made commitments and, obviously, we are the only ones actually paying.	83.65239635838843
The other parties are not paying.	41.78644809477309
We wish to see an end to this one-sided situation regarding requests for financial aid.	54.33378769382099
We would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this.	30.40215060614276
We would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors.	55.0338471452093
This is not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to Kosovo but, quite the contrary, to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors.	45.49103953334808
From that point of view, the proposed facility is a two-phase aid facility and the second tranche must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest.	100.9507812131441
Finally, we have three questions for the Commission in this regard. Firstly, we need the Commission to give us, on a regular basis, the list and the amounts that other donors contribute.	63.30721392087613
When we come to pay, we want to know what the others are paying.	73.17185971269676
Secondly, we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation.	46.31531036085428
During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet, according to our information, no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date.	68.96566159540343
This is serious, since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo.	71.40638689511619
Finally, and this follows on from what I have just said, we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis, monthly, regarding progress on payments made.	66.29915491472339
We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments.	306.6260272769058
It is not firm commitments that we need, just plain commitments would suffice, and we need to know what has actually been paid and, more especially, what has not been paid.	65.2201343583642
Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment.	127.45891226770225
Mr President, if we are going to discuss Kosovo today, as we have done many times before, then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo, or of whether in fact anything has been done at all.	46.83761416743475
What I mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to normality, and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate.	39.99601527123621
As of 9 February, there will be something known as the Kosovo Transitional Council, which will comprise representatives of the political parties, the minorities and civil society, and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament.	87.4240449823729
This is a positive move and we welcome it, but I believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare, for elections are planned for the autumn.	73.00495705821412
No one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result.	54.82467558722011
No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-à-vis UNMIK.	84.85162479057254
In other words, there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either.	35.52722794900679
Of all people, it is the Albanians, who are now being integrated into the transitional council, who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them.	72.41510521361646
In addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work, urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of Serbs, Albanians and other minorities - not forgetting the Roma of course - in this country, so that at some point in the near future, on the road to coexistence, it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place.	68.94524279147352
I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about.	35.537698845832914
Administration-wise there are now 34 tax inspectors.	640.6479385525491
That is excellent news!	93.16475348662948
There too, people are being encouraged to pay their taxes, for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources.	72.03544289645879
It should also be noted that of the 19 departments, 4 already have administrative leadership, which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto.	118.07149162995313
There is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law. We have 130 judges and public prosecutors, who have now been sworn in, and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice, with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little, and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions.	69.13186699867221
Another positive development I would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UCK is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country.	38.668054717772115
I believe that is a good thing	12.449148433798108
I wholly endorse what the Committee on Budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the Commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way.	104.16806771617385
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything.	69.00661606142158
It is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the Fourth Pillar, but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay Mr Kouchner' s outstanding bills.	57.8492693873162
One could do so once or twice, but I feel that the UN donors should contribute to this as well, for there is a very large hole, as yet unfilled, that we are unable to fill.	68.17593714497019
We have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it.	47.64964360698558
Mr President, I would like to offer a few explanations.	13.882612653483005
In a debate, there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said.	34.34004284955273
However, I would like to concentrate on two points.	11.370260132753291
Firstly, I would like to make it very clear that the Union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo.	21.17872946091264
I would like to point out to Mrs Albright that what we have read recently in the press is true, and that figures do not lie.	40.70977940205793
Let us make this clear, however much some people may not wish to believe it.	84.82330723149416
The Union has decided to assist with a further EUR 35 million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo, on the basis of an IMF report which estimates that a further EUR 115 million is needed for that reconstruction.	49.125168958977135
I would like to say to Mrs Pack that I am in complete agreement with her when she says that the Commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments.	40.30715157278714
I would also like to express my concern - which is very considerable - at the statement by some Ministers at the last Ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to alter, in any circumstances, the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin.	45.914393430966165
This calls into question the agreement which Parliament reached, with great difficulty, with the Council in December, according to which, when the Commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction, the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary.	76.01699516526529
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach.	73.43422125564257
I would like to ask the Commission - and I am glad that Commissioner Solbes is here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme, with the corresponding report, requested by Parliament, so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up, as we have been promised.	44.52490258070264
Lastly, I would like to insist that, although we have agreed to EUR 35 million now, we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough, and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for Kosovo, which is so badly needed.	31.009763037560987
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse my late arrival, but this other political issue is still on the agenda today, more is the pity.	85.09891430704835
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million, and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need.	49.517462828223344
The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there.	82.09819813596555
However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process.	32.56755866512118
Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents.	89.84688614518339
Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions.	77.67325029934011
I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future.	42.28636255521982
It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this.	40.39529438693186
However, we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here.	60.67534359974309
One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims.	89.89046736508011
In other words, we should ensure that the money falls to Mr Kouchner' s sphere of competence and not to other spheres.	36.73204799002862
Secondly, even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there, we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into.	60.90535594503769
This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations.	29.7597132588321
It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe, in the interests of the persons affected.	63.913450419591506
This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms, that is to say, not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east Europe, and with the aid delivered there.	60.47701954351839
This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence.	39.49444768626389
We have so many coordinators, who, in turn, are responsible to so many employers, that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators.	44.46148794117145
Perhaps it would be better, however, if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations, were to get together some time to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there.	58.06723938355912
I know that the Commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this, but if the European Union is doing the most work out there, then it should also be given the leadership, and bring coherence to the situation, so that we can be of real assistance to the people.	51.7462767057448
It makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground!	78.72810249442732
Bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed - it is now set for the end of March - that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline, that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented, and there is a steady stream of new press conferences, this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of Europe!	72.29545339465254
Accordingly, we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative, so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month. Rather, we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country, and I hope that in the process, you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months.	42.76711607151921
Mr President, when the Alliance intervened in Kosovo its objective was to re-establish conditions in this province which would enable those who wished to do so to stay there or return, with respect for their own heritage and their own culture.	67.43556711388757
If the Alliance is still active in that region, it is with the same objective.	60.05510320216594
The day before yesterday I was pleased to hear an interview given by the KFOR commander showing how much better matters in connection with this in Kosovo were starting to be, particularly as regards security, crime levels had been restored to an acceptable level.	110.5635256032822
Those representing Europe who are active at the grass roots level in pursuing this objective, and I am thinking in particular of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, are on the verge of despondency precisely because, since matters are improving, there is less talk of Kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which is needed there is becoming less apparent.	56.42542663241623
We must work to ensure that, in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally, the rule of shopkeepers follows the rule of the warlords.	54.556393771082476
It is true that economic aid is, in this respect, certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level.	64.49706879171924
Let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we, the Members of the European Parliament, must fulfil our own obligations in this regard, while ensuring, of course, that we are not the only ones to do so.	45.34823913296989
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Brok, for his report.	7.944176890880089
If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on.	66.36747611836022
The Council' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret.	45.63191781640932
The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should, and must, provide help swiftly, however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random.	58.976968718309436
I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point, which clearly emphasises that it is only possible, and permissible, to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public, communal and other authorities and institutions, which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK.	74.1486423026708
Commissioner, it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations, in particular Pillar 4 of course, and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place.	62.29940087225591
What is to be done with this money?	26.860166967039813
I would like to highlight the issue of human rights.	10.14442298784217
The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today?	46.29168558699082
We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen: people are killed, people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit.	140.3106121877189
Every single day there are attacks on Serbs, on the Roma, on Bosnians, but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians.	130.6342243798486
I was in fact shocked to read in the report, assuming this is true, how an Albanian doctor, who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties, ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life.	109.28177870151433
These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated.	77.55149248230708
I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo.	64.37370720238874
There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again.	53.01890389093489
It is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is Serbs, Roma, Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo.	61.95817734902959
It is also irrelevant, in my view, as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo.	70.62985742373377
What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together.	83.26311494929207
We need more police officers, as we have nowhere near enough.	88.1212328502955
We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish -, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights.	72.18894092766952
All of this needs to happen, and quickly too.	72.80985621579451
If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise.	77.34438885202914
That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly, to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available.	40.92119834750638
Only, now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use, notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary.	58.29228441609626
. (ES) Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Members, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue.	26.308290285598474
This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned.	70.89050700446357
I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight' s debate.	52.28287364937011
Firstly, although much progress has been made, and we could mention customs administration, bank administration or tax administration, it is true that we must continue to move forward.	124.15281376874935
However, in moving forward, what should we be financing?	112.69770239954238
This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement.	29.68348724406056
In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with Union funds, for example, Amendments Nos 3 and 5.	87.63373170261212
In our view, however, in both respects, greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which, on the ground, is more aware of the reality than we are.	53.58972414819741
We believe that to prejudge, at the moment, where resources should be directed, would create more practical difficulties.	73.1828861188884
In short, we should put our faith in those parties who, in these areas, are better equipped than us to make certain decisions.	60.667011681440066
The second concern which I notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by Mr Bourlanges, but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors.	68.87499046041414
Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate?	73.80707129837239
Some of the amendments in your report pose this question.	38.2994148497783
For example, Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4.	31.44857799676624
I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue, that this is not the fundamental problem, although we recognise it totally.	39.15293790755471
The fundamental problem is that, at the moment, the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the High Level Steering Group, but it is also true that they have no legal status. This is simply a political commitment.	34.876038329544855
That is the reason why, while accepting its spirit, we would ask that Amendment No 1 be worded differently - and we have sent a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resources.	51.23923545766231
I would say the same about Amendment No 2, which we would also accept with a slight modification, since the idea seems to us to be basically correct.	56.11268324711274
Amendment No 4 is of a similar nature.	32.05724138167594
On this specific point, we can perhaps offer Mr Bourlanges greater satisfaction.	178.23044278124337
We have already spoken to the Council so that it might include a Commission statement in its decision, establishing this element of conditionality.	42.40215968684844
With regard to the second contribution, what we propose is that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decided in accordance with the external financial needs of Kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors.	57.08077952288618
In other words, we should not establish conditionality, or we believe that it is more effective not to establish conditionality from the start, but, nevertheless, we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage.	41.6306243865519
In this way, we would have no problem in acting immediately. We would not create problems for the Kosovar people, but, on the other hand, we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing.	40.50619307496655
A third problem has been raised by Mrs Dührkop with regard to the multiannual programmes.	30.53024590270006
I would remind you that these projects are multiannual.	23.04403212679542
The programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account.	122.06393022113632
Lastly, I would like to make some observations on the requests for additional information which have been addressed to us.	24.78318751861205
On the one hand, we have been asked to provide Parliament with information regarding the progress of invitations to tender and, in this respect, I can tell you that the Commission was last week able to provide Parliament' s Committee on Budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments carried out since the task force was sent into action in Kosovo.	48.729581013566545
The Commission can commit itself to regularly informing Parliament of the invitations to tender which are published.	73.01303376744573
We also wish to see these publicised on the Internet, so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point.	35.19088854443897
A second point which I would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to Parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance.	46.00060403801998
In this respect I would like to tell you that the Commission is prepared to keep the chairmen of the various committees involved in this area regularly informed, on a confidential basis, if the nature of the information provided requires confidentiality, on the different schemes being implemented for macroeconomic assistance.	36.549059802423095
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that, with the final decision of the Council, we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in Kosovo by different parties, so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see.	45.256528467868044
Mr President, I am pleased to see the convergence of viewpoints there is between Parliament, particularly the Committee on Budgets, and the Commission, and we can assure you that, for our part, we shall always be there to assist the Commission in the performance of its duties.	40.90274345066807
I do, however, have one small concern, when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the Committee on Budgets.	36.22394946805828
There was a clear agreement, good or bad I will not say, but there was a contract. There was a clear understanding between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was agreement on Amendments 4 and 7, i.e. on the idea of linking the mobilisation, the implementation, of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment.	80.14448147090697
But, if I understand what Mr Solbes Mira says correctly, then this undertaking was only a tentative one.	65.41067818741223
Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement.	96.38125102745788
Can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the Committee on Budgets, yes or no? Or are you going to drop this proviso, thus breaking the undertaking made to us?	93.97298748674056
No, Mr Bourlanges, I think it is a substantive problem.	61.66061833784509
The problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted.	82.61968667960502
What I proposed to you, and what I still say, is that the Commission will make a statement, in the Council Decision, something like this:	55.52218999747677
The exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in Kosovo' s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors.	84.77191479055709
With this, we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed.	49.46075624843846
I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tranche.	42.06046913044955
I agree, absolutely. We shall do so.	41.103961653223294
The debate is closed.	3.77548916318001
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	5.224258125996437
ALTENER	3360.3280828868546
The next item is the report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD))	10.074183888426294
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council.	28.6419306240451
The project has been long and problematic.	43.40814294423871
In future too, there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources.	40.85804533865318
Although there is much that is good about the new directive, it is nonetheless not without its defects.	72.12112631013377
One example is the use of peat.	55.02956983556297
Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels.	43.472325006620245
If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must form its own class, especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned.	80.27884631874386
It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as, for example, coal.	38.944498158758705
The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union' s dependence on imported energy.	59.033831503837426
Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU' s next round of enlargement.	96.19942842613054
Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries, whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy.	154.55915986825724
The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate.	37.01001864316898
We are all concerned about the environment and our children' s future.	30.715868648292616
The share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased, but it has to be done in a rational manner.	51.34184575550635
We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come.	42.42557966777419
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate: nuclear energy.	89.46580006311729
Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme.	17.817520416041962
Firstly, however, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the truly excellent work he has done on this report.	17.433712443997923
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan.	14.534420040777505
For as Mr Langen said just now, we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee.	81.52668619801024
However, we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout.	126.42843036026387
Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point, that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community.	61.29114598370062
This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear.	24.57050911758715
However, we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed.	53.81696698872383
For in the course of the next few years, the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double, accounting for at least 12% of energy consumption.	51.83704752511242
This is the European Union' s declared aim.	22.896363697567054
That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role.	105.19889481075286
In the first place, this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme. This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector, developing local and regional energy agencies, and establishing new networks for approving financial support, to name but a few examples.	126.00683302828243
To my mind though, what is particularly important about the ALTENER II programme are the new actions for relieving market saturation by renewable energies and those for implementing, supporting and monitoring the Community strategy and the Community action plan.	99.55601051950096
We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission' s services on a breakthrough campaign, which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy.	43.22080158405027
It contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors.	90.0697279640747
It is very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it.	37.67948643349757
The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion.	88.89597022001482
75%-80% of this is to come from private sources, and this will be supplemented by public funds from the Member States and from the regions.	48.32027514263882
In this respect, the ALTENER programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment, and help us to realise our ambition, in the interests of environmental protection, the economy and creating new jobs.	51.49935731688852
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mr Langen for his excellent work in this important matter.	8.480445835615582
The conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the Altener programme as put forward by the Conciliation Committee is, after all the difficult phases it has been through, at least satisfactory.	81.62151844625129
Most of Parliament' s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to EUR 77 million must be seen as positive.	43.68855890786022
The Union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy.	53.86225367611072
There is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets, however.	50.27029906210158
The appropriations are needed for pilot projects, research, information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy.	95.8037772387857
The main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the Member States.	16.737548516440352
This programme will hopefully encourage Member States to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy.	53.89822261427156
However, in the future, the Union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market.	47.98206033504014
Promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment.	38.69706914641937
The Union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up.	42.73433677620744
Renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness.	203.33407791158226
Europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy.	45.60877211881357
We should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment.	25.421565491391014
May I also venture to raise the matter of peat?	52.88929323218486
Peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources.	45.46306569262458
However, it is important, at least in Finland, as a sustainably used, slowly renewable energy source.	96.42220844966906
I hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables.	19.05682614953262
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are pleased with the agreement which has been found, and their thanks go to all those who negotiated so well in favour of an amendment which the Greens were almost the authors of.	48.98342014052122
It is interesting for me, as a new Member of Parliament, to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco cultivation.	39.32407210151141
This is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale.	91.57488728263891
In contrast with that, I see the amounts allocated for renewable energies, which are not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion.	96.28331801501494
Seeing the market share that small countries such as Denmark have been capable of acquiring in this field, because they were the first ones to develop that area, gives one food for thought, I feel, and I think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies.	88.90957809891414
One last word regarding the programme. I think it very important for renewable energies to be firmly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there.	47.4283893855769
In order to ensure that at least 50% of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources, it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term.	29.8619895198548
Mr President, may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work.	27.924361590227317
The activities of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy sources and I believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future.	93.79597641092982
For this reason, I am particularly pleased to see the monies focussed on projects by small and medium-sized enterprises.	25.526655133347752
The internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone.	86.43202054677532
In this regard, it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national remit.	59.79108395655969
It is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables.	66.02855621793059
I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend £125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector.	50.07923270347218
I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiatives.	72.43461741225265
As the final text rightly states, actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities.	131.55870557431973
I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster, a significant portion of which falls within Ireland' s only Objective I region.	95.51731836919132
I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions, including the energy sector.	88.92827643207244
In short, we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol, while at the same time promoting growth in our economies.	81.84600678888019
ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States.	37.31600920443225
Mr President, Mr Langen, ladies and gentlemen, as our rapporteur mentioned, we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the Council on the ALTENER programme.	32.36376962193176
Mr Langen mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the Council was initially FF 74 million, whereas the Commission proposed 81.1 million, a figure which the European Parliament supported.	78.54785204466077
An initial conciliation meeting was not successful, because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1.9 million.	92.74128793719339
We could not agree with a proposal like this, which challenged the authority of the European Parliament.	29.345429225284903
A second round of conciliation achieved an increase of EUR 1.1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million.	99.51737580574765
In spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal, personally, once again I deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the Council in this situation is in rude contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply, job creation and environmental protection, challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to.	59.423689204188676
In fact, renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives.	85.52837972950086
However, in spite of the reservations I am expressing on the paucity of the financial allocation, I personally support the compromise, by virtue of the programme' s content, to which the European Parliament made an active contribution as, following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, this sector become subject to codecision.	42.87527406373165
It is practically certain that, with the raft of proposed measures and actions, it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12% renewable energy share by 2010, doubling the current rate, as long as the appropriations including state appropriations are made available.	106.94361888259918
This programme, together with the SAVE II programme, integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy, establishes a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence.	203.69284497859147
And, in conclusion, Mr President, let me also insist upon the fact that, in addition to the measures proposed, there are also legislative measures and, most especially, adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives.	82.12462693224833
And I shall end, of course, by congratulating Mr Langen, our rapporteur, on his work, as well as all the members of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee.	32.57333612254856
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached on the ALTENER II programme in the Conciliation Committee and associate myself with the comments of the different speakers and, of course, point out that this agreement will allow the ALTENER programme to be incorporated soon into the framework energy programme.	51.22086530734662
All of this will provide greater coordination, transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes, into which we will also have to incorporate the SAVE programme, which we will be discussing soon.	77.53045403897316
I would like to say that the work carried out during this time by Parliament has been of a high quality, and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary.	33.02319733986451
Obviously, there have been arguments, we had to go to conciliation, as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron reminded us a moment ago, since at the first meeting no result was achieved, and there had to be a second meeting, despite the fact that the figures were not excessive.	76.9080718104915
However, I believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement, which, like all agreements, is perhaps not perfect, but which, I believe, allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing.	73.0608857014426
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on his work, to thank the speakers and, of course, to acknowledge the actions of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure, who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result.	41.98268377525824
I would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the Council.	27.565875880517414
SAVE	1406.6640112473817
The next item is the report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD)).	9.84650223563508
Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round, which is not always the case.	40.139786743967825
I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form.	96.54016734580786
The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there.	66.50242713603365
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading.	124.16086532160399
I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments, including a re-instatement of the Commission' s original budget.	39.50230158630025
The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable.	74.67427265632593
During the procedure, agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise, implement, complement and assess the Community measures.	168.93011865232168
Compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and, very importantly, the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency.	215.42749380697924
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress.	22.551032011615067
The issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council' s very meagre opening offer.	44.39805776666294
In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount.	103.4555484046792
We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under.	96.85523024603624
This was an important consideration for us.	30.098151803884953
I would like to say however that it is, and has always been, a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real.	39.54809999632335
Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States.	179.94157202474432
We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme.	71.61275038668492
If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level, this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action, including Community actions, on energy saving.	52.054251971411155
Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region.	62.1611807644792
We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard.	19.264552228785355
SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy.	66.90494090699379
It focuses on non-technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure, and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted.	102.83191286462625
Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings.	67.08018857649597
We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business, saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical.	120.51454586539626
It is something that we can all support.	25.584537934232237
I have to say, like motherhood, although we all support it, sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving.	70.45296176778851
We could do rather more, considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports.	67.87259152870206
We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see.	53.43885143273139
We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change.	103.8293157158434
If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do.	22.845461359461996
I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process.	25.731795188382787
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal, since she has contributed, in collaboration with the other Members, to the achievement of a very reasonable final result, which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the Commission itself and, of course, on what, from a budgetary point of view, the Council had initially accepted.	43.41855559653016
As Mrs Ahern has explained very well, the budgets of both the SAVE programme and the ALTENER programme, are basically symbolic budgets, since the burden is shouldered by the countries, the States of the Union, the regions or even, in some cases, the local authorities.	71.68299232036651
However, despite the fact that the volume is relatively small, it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action, which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments. This action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources, greater safety in our energy supplies and, in the case of SAVE, to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy, thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set.	75.69511005666453
Furthermore, behind these programmes, that is to say, the SAVE programme, which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings, and the Altener programme, which concerns renewable energy, there lies an extremely important technological challenge, which, from an economic point of view, may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole.	84.17705374641015
With regard to the parliamentary procedure, I would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken, especially the rapporteur, because the majority of Parliament' s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council, in this case practically all of them, although with some modifications. I would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved.	36.85084389024588
This improvement has been achieved with fresh funds, as we said at the time, and it has been achieved while safeguarding this Parliament' s prerogatives and competences.	73.0045045104254
From the point of view of the Commission, in this interinstitutional game, I believe that this is important and I am very happy to highlight it.	18.2271872727606
I would like once again to thank all the speakers, and also, especially, the Vice-President, Mr Provan, for his magnificent work throughout this debate, particularly during the conciliation procedure, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry and, also, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Ahern, and all the Members who have participated in this work.	26.856216012574105
Thank you, Commissioner.	17.829151062792345
The debate is closed.	3.77548916318001
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	5.224258125996437
CULTURE 2000	289.28221794412457
The next item is the report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ('Culture 2000') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD)).	11.33538402519271
Madam President, I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate.	61.8505831406988
Unfortunately, there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it.	66.70511389187172
We have the feeling, and are in fact convinced, that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht.	44.052255258484955
For no one is very keen to spend money on culture.	113.29113466633522
Sadly that is the case and we must face facts.	73.51539854618865
I would like to thank the rapporteur, who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task, in conjunction with the Commissioner of course.	32.415076174995065
We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content, of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect.	43.503938191407606
One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind, where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision.	83.44563063099865
What kind of horse-trading system is this?	143.18999192341627
Certainly not a fair one! There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side, begging for a little more money for culture.	77.31879789566943
It is downright scandalous what goes on!	66.62345051241186
It is an awful sort of horse-trading, based on unequal positions!	86.07674619841751
Nevertheless, we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to.	37.11302163536398
It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us.	160.20659101088515
We will support small and medium-sized events, not the large ones, and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access.	157.91938397897482
I believe that the fact that Culture and, fittingly, Education and Youth now fall within the same Commissioner' s remit, will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programmes, which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the European Union.	49.850500183102504
If one puts all the money together and creates synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied, but then only a tiny bit.	128.38693791712208
It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money.	22.529364037277524
Madam President, I agree with the fine words with which the rapporteur began his intervention and I must add that, during the conciliation procedure, I was personally a little disappointed with the Council.	35.00767294829767
On the one hand, it continued to refuse to accept the term "European cultural policy" or other similar terms, even undervaluing the terms of the Treaty, and it defines "Culture 2000" simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more.	82.61247750115113
On the other hand, it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this Parliament, which were minimal anyway.	44.58613275462867
Incidentally, this last point would be unfair to fourteen Members of the Council, since it was just one, the Netherlands, which was responsible for that intransigence.	65.59261389970354
It has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the Council.	52.438621111325276
This demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution.	207.11256620291329
However, Madam President, these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow, and which the Socialists will vote in favour of, will put in place one of the European Union' s most important programmes.	38.509892096949066
By taking action in the field of culture, we are directly contributing to the construction of a European soul, especially given the fact that the sub-programmes which make up "Culture 2000" are superb.	59.775918235423354
In recent years, these have been amongst the programmes most eagerly accepted by the youngest and most dynamic citizens of the European Union.	38.145424682259055
Lastly, I would like to mention the profoundly human impression I have formed of the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura: his knowledge, his sense of balance, his intellectual qualities, make him, in my opinion, the best possible rapporteur this report could have had.	109.52540174610985
Congratulations!	2760.621453610906
Finally, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Reding, Vice-President Imbeni and Mr Gargani, chairman of the Committee on Culture, for the firm and intelligent position which, each within his own role, they have maintained during the entire conciliation process.	65.370392805528
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would like to start by thanking Mr Graça Moura most warmly for the tremendous efforts he has put into the discussion of this Culture 2000 programme.	26.832023496770585
It has been said before, and we have discussed this between ourselves on various occasions, that culture is, of course, extremely important as an area unto itself - I would like to stress this once again - but also as the instrument par excellence for furthering the European idea.	53.0192072684044
It is also of great importance to citizens.	24.204053028113194
We should, above all, not lose sight of this. The impetus given to the European idea by this programme is having an enormous impact, especially on small linguistic areas such as the Netherlands which not only has national potential, but is also relying on support from the programme, mainly from a language point of view.	97.8664563392419
Today, we have arrived at the end of a long road.	20.909275042856226
I would nonetheless like, as others have done, to touch upon the procedure, which is unclear and, above all, unwanted.	52.837542768466726
Codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand.	135.5426054397519
They are like a snake biting its own tail.	43.99278613932997
There is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand: anything is open for discussion, as long as the budget stays fixed.	89.39910373005063
As it happens - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage.	29.03466490060115
The result is 30% growth, so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result.	74.93701842705487
Of course, it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and I for one will always advocate this - but I do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes.	92.28070838138527
I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot.	23.454909694515027
Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas.	52.4773551615699
A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds, and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind.	34.89993578258903
Fortunately, I am on the Committee on Regional Policy.	28.203075927515187
So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention.	73.98624969580214
I think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because, if it happens to be cancelled, then surely this does not benefit the citizen.	55.11801764356509
I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect.	41.45263455055184
However, I do think that it is necessary, as he always states too, that, in the next IGC, changes will be made to codecision, when unanimity will no longer be necessary.	71.19494846463847
We are very positive about the many improvements which have been made: no more mega-projects, room for cultural networks, and sufficient attention to promoting reading, translating and translation companies.	134.78537013256766
This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000.	32.26970813528036
All that remains for me to say is: time to get down to business.	78.8662975453285
Madam President, all that I wanted to say has been covered by those fellow Members who spoke before me and I think there is unanimity among the groups in the European Parliament and among those of us on the Committee on Culture.	47.67104034466438
I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart.	40.621889814838646
Not because our delegation, our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding' s attitude - I think that, given the framework she was operating in, her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council.	88.43947337209416
It is shameful!	63.68076174302169
That figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union!	26.4496531262683
When we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups, young musicians, pioneering activities in the arts, writers, to humiliate them and send them packing with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slips in such a way that they begin to perceive Europe as something foreign, something opposed, contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the European Union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro, not just enlargement, nor geostrategic expedients, but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of European Unification - then this is indeed a sorry way to end.	82.5300697112947
	785.4324778346265
	785.4324778346265
So long as we continue to have unanimity, so long as yesterday the Dutch Government was able to impose those EUR 167 million as an ultimatum and so long as a government with Mr Haider will soon be telling us what cultural activities we can pursue, we will never progress.	85.3257242308582
That is why it is very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decisions and to cut free so that the European Parliament' s efforts to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the European area may be rid of this constraint by all the governments.	49.04009390452897
Madam President, I absolutely agree with the rapporteur' s analysis and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Culture, Mr Gargani, for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that was also, considerably difficult.	21.639221426736942
Of course, we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programmes, but everyone hoped that the Culture programme could help to promote, for example, the unique features of each cultural sector, even - and I could say especially - of the unique features of less well-known sectors.	83.76903199913313
We hope that this, at the least, will come about during the evaluation process.	58.47884281955332
We sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action, among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social, as well as economic, development of a people.	69.72030373560577
And a fully-fledged Europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully rediscover its roots, highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well-known.	116.67510773116007
As for the important educational task which the European Union must carry out as regards culture, one of the programme' s most obvious limitations is the level of funding - we have heard this several times - which censures the fact that the Council at least - certainly not the Commissioner - is not completely aware of the importance of cultural action: the document which prioritises the economic factor over social integration also bears witness to this.	71.36550549069985
The overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens: this is why we believe that the Culture 2000 programme, albeit with a scarcity of funds, can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal.	46.34732238227744
Madam President, I will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that I support the adoption of Culture 2000 and add my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, who took over from our former colleague Nana Mouskouri.	39.641680233474226
Both of them have done a first-class job.	79.63409735995586
Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day, culture may not seem that important, but it is; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important.	77.20355926642505
Why do I say that culture is important?	38.63087320325785
Well in simple economic terms, Europe' s culture adds to genuine prosperity.	227.76506608825673
Where would Europe' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture?	148.4091960965832
But, more importantly than that, cultural activities are what make mankind civilised.	229.57071517454253
Culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs; and an uncultured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy.	41.34046540338582
Cultural diversity is important, and it is under threat.	49.93960050290696
However, it is not under threat from Europe.	31.34252660848573
Many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat, for example, from Portugal, from Germany, from Finland, for heaven' s sake.	170.25521636195828
We do drink port wine, and we do like German beer, and we even use Finnish saunas, but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat.	104.75848745354641
What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Coca Cola, eating hamburgers, wearing baseball caps, watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time.	46.896310943377415
Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe' s culture, but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can.	56.620803817429206
That is what Culture 2000 is about.	60.82046749254691
So, I say to the Council of Ministers: Keep this programme genuinely under review.	83.16419430998606
Are we doing enough?	124.99852116917187
And, I say to Madame Reding, thank you for the support and the help you have given so far, keep up the good work, we are on your side.	86.02734269372768
Madam President, I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Graa Moura, and Commissioner Reding, for their contribution to the creation of this programme.	17.926551195369424
The Culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council.	28.3050295828632
The outcome can be considered reasonable, when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme called for a unanimous decision to be made in the Council.	31.518070455430518
We have to hope that at the forthcoming IGC we will also end up with qualified majority decisions in the area of culture.	32.996666960738736
It is really strange that legislation that adheres to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the Council.	52.89849918009255
The framework programme on culture is replacing the present Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael programmes.	72.26801796750591
When implementation of the programme begins, I hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utilised to the full. I believe and hope that, despite the assault on us all of the new technology, literature will maintain its status.	92.69716438965617
We need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial.	92.9664321551638
Literature likewise plays an important part in the way it transmits our cultural heritage, increases mutual familiarity and preserves linguistic wealth and the diversity of tongues.	70.35510156534939
In this connection, I am very glad to say that soon after the Socrates and Culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon, the country holding the presidency of the EU is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries.	46.06771859304093
I hope that this conference will also encourage the Commission to take the issue of libraries into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society.	29.29736073365307
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, somehow or other, today' s agenda has come full circle.	64.4823697686239
We have had a great deal to say today about Europe as a community of values, about tolerance, human dignity, human rights, a positive approach to the enlargement process, transparency and respect for each other.	69.78226712033256
Youth, education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values, for giving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it credible in their eyes.	77.1980374350329
The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union' s goals.	58.33805447185628
Cultural activity creates identity.	346.8578702081703
Cultural activity is an expression of individuality, of an individual' s own personality; it builds relationships and communicates.	53.24093354352534
We want a colourful Europe.	34.36409738298878
We want a Europe based on the principle of diversity within unity.	52.95760671598964
We want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences.	122.91088017320415
That is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget, the allocation of funds that is, into the different types of measure.	45.11416304794995
That is why we opposed concentrating heavily on large networks and network structures, because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entities and activities performed by individuals; because we want to see thousands of flowers bloom.	49.34567893939007
I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say.	31.55467224645552
There is a contradiction in terms - unanimity principle, codecision procedure, and Conciliation Committee - and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen, and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a European consciousness.	93.69566627460127
Madam President, as we have heard, all the groups have a common political enemy in the Council.	34.85194119631391
It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture' s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure, for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests.	60.45663473288863
In this way, the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order.	46.85859040917297
The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years, and now, at long last, the European Parliament can give the go-ahead.	65.75498576338697
The Council could not be moved, not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael finished.	54.24280898561985
A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap.	207.57270081419577
This showed up the weaknesses of the European Union' s cultural policy activities once again.	33.602838042270925
The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support.	146.97331861741333
Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered.	116.78782307037737
The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro!	54.82679316595735
And so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004.	95.28840460010578
That is the same as a single, medium-sized, German opera house' s expenditure over the same period, when here in Europe this sum has been earmarked for 29 countries over a period of five years!	91.48240510453105
There is a blatant discrepancy here!	24.143300495005036
And so we are going to have to be content, albeit very grudgingly, with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content.	32.73162736970639
Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out.	155.73031229482652
We can only hope that it will, after all, be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day.	50.0430084587979
Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good, not harm!	188.82738341539977
Cultural cooperation - and this was also mentioned earlier - truly creates identity, far more so than any transport directive, however important it might be.	548.5969324927446
Providing support for culture meets with wide-spread acceptance, and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions.	277.8751725524409
What, may I ask, is the Council afraid of?	92.25875356097292
Madam President, whoever has the honour, like myself, to chair the Committee on Culture, cannot fail to agree with the comments from various Members and can but congratulate the rapporteur, and Commissioner Reding, with whom he worked and who, even during the conciliation process, had difficult moments and opposed the Council - you have heard this said by everyone.	101.30057222854839
I have noticed how the principle of a necessary culture at European organisational level has been firmly asserted, but there are few opportunities to address all the requests that the European States will make.	79.12115321736673
I shall simply stress my own personal complaint because, in the end, we did not manage to adopt a review clause.	75.8653049816798
However, Mrs Reding was certainly receptive and farsighted, and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years, and therefore to change the situation.	82.10179978234264
The cultural programmes launched in years past - Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael - are being replaced by a single programme, Culture 2000, where - and I must stress this here very forcefully - the rapporteur censures a position which should give the European Parliament cause for reflection - as someone said this afternoon - but which still underlines the huge importance of being part of a vast community where cultural interpretation is a democratic factor.	90.96021651458013
This is not rhetoric, but the new embodiment of a modern liberalism which unites the European States and constitutes a turning point for the European Parliament and the Commission.	30.826994204585635
We agree with this approach and despite the lack of funds, this evening' s result will serve to greatly boost this strategy and this opportunity for Europe, which will then give rise to an economic factor and a growth factor; culture then, and an institutional aspect, the basis for structuring a vast community, a prerequisite for economic growth, and not the complete opposite, as Europe, in its cultural habits, has perhaps been used to viewing things in the past.	87.11124448763697
Man and culture are priorities, and culture can result in economic growth.	179.1109502080316
Let us contemplate this result, derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy.	162.29041522141267
Madam President, may I first thank Mr Graça Moura for weaving his way through the rather tough textiles and fibres that have made up this conciliation tapestry.	72.95936826447023
It seems to me when entering the conciliation process for Culture 2000, having a poet to lead us in our endeavours is entirely appropriate.	84.98330410568626
Again, because these conciliations are not entirely straight forward, we have to thank Vice-President Imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the convoluted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wisely deployed and given to us in our Community.	83.06396529351723
The fundamental question, it seems to me, that faces this Parliament, the Commission and the Council is: What is Europe?	56.427498412436826
What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries?	77.2638465346958
Europe is its people, its history and now its collectivity; but the reason why Culture 2000 is so important to us is for this: I will wager that when we ask the question - 'What is Europe?' - we answer it by saying, 'It is our art, it is our literature and it is our heritage.'	141.1708980049245
That is what Culture 2000 represents.	98.52192402306918
It represents the possibility of sustaining a European identity in the twenty-first century, an identity which eschews the echoes of division, of war, of poverty, of opportunity, of poverty dans la realité.	60.70929063177546
And more than this - and this is more prosaic, Madam President, it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive, that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require.	106.24154387625869
It promotes mobility, and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded.	84.77947411618169
My only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver.	57.728602092975564
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now come to the end of a long road.	15.949694848073692
Following the conciliation stage, our institutions can now formally adopt the new 'Culture 2000' framework programme.	219.3863501621137
We shall thus, in the course of the next five years, have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear, well-structured and, I am sure, successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector.	88.54399321514127
It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this 'happy ending' in this House, and I thank you for it.	43.87160959254681
I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process.	49.16449134504904
I should like to express especial thanks to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, particularly to its rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, its chairman, Mr Gargani, the European Parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups, the Conciliation Committee and its chairman, Mr Imbeni.	50.93600931441809
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution.	210.54772969753952
Throughout the negotiations, they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally tiresome negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time.	102.07838565302451
We now have a framework programme, the first of its type for the cultural sector, and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive, but also more thorough and detailed manner.	63.08325947808446
I would like to express my delight, with you, at this pleasing outcome. In spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions, these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gargani has just said, that the Commission made a statement regarding a mid-term assessment.	39.78093416159878
It stated that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with Article 7 of the European Parliament and Council decision, it would carry out an assessment of the results of the programme, and this assessment will also cover the financial resources in the context of the Community financial perspectives.	28.02558165108737
If need be, the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision, and this should be achieved by 30 June 2002.	64.55589839877118
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a formal commitment, not just words on paper.	39.425740936359595
All this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area, within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features, in all their diversity, but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of Europe may participate fully in them.	92.15459440253589
It is thanks, too, to Parliament' s action, preferring a number of small-scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens' cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale.	67.62729468991009
This is going to lead us to make 'Culture 2000' the programme of the citizen.	46.28663100952588
The increased participation of our citizens is something I hope and pray for. I would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and I undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality.	49.20492448087642
I know that you, as Members of Parliament, in your own regions and countries, are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers, as one Member of Parliament said, go to make a vast multicoloured carpet.	63.8437586506214
I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens, both in personal as well as in social and economic terms, but a right which it is our job to assert, and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the Union.	52.36203773487294
This is what our European 'Culture 2000' programme offers.	120.53764933671701
It does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States.	28.6996166136507
Such policies are necessary, and I would like to see them developed further.	72.47794291875876
It simply adds to them, complements them, building a bridge between the various cultures of our various countries.	63.20125494717985
I feel therefore that extending and enriching European citizens' participation in culture is a crucial task, one which justifies the efforts we make to achieve it, and this is the yardstick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our Union.	68.14704292855895
A number of Members of Parliament have quite rightly raised this point. If the Union is purely an economic union, then it is a stillborn project.	54.095062841640114
However, if it is a union of culture, civilisation and participation, then it becomes a living thing.	76.62628342806981
This is the foundation, ladies and gentlemen, which I intend to develop, and I shall take the following five areas into special consideration: firstly, providing creative people with opportunities of an innovative nature to allow their talent to find the support it deserves in our programme.	111.86676011405703
Secondly, encouraging exchanges, mobility and training in the cultural sector.	88.60988258164872
Thirdly, promoting cooperation between cultural operators.	162.74856732297388
Fourthly, increasing audiences for culture, with particular emphasis on attracting young people to culture and, fifthly, protecting the common cultural heritage on the European scale as well as the history of the peoples of Europe, and making them better known.	79.97688928852148
The new programme will, I am sure, in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency, efficiency and balance, prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures.	75.15917602333738
Madam President, I reiterate my thanks to Parliament for its support and for, once again, having shown the importance it attaches to culture in the context of the Union.	49.66535121670048
I am certain that it will not be disappointed, having given us its support, and I personally undertake to keep Parliament informed, as things progress, of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens, which I hope will be great measures for the future of the Union.	54.440609134637825
Thank you, Commissioner.	17.829151062792345
I think we can also thank the rapporteur once again.	17.127867669051646
The debate is closed.	3.77548916318001
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	5.224258125996437
(The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m.)	7.90554371176984
End-of-life vehicles	137.90666161591065
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles [8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)	14.79080887928821
Mr President, nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in Europe.	50.115136665301236
Even though they can no longer be driven, these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders; and not just intra-Community borders, but also those outside the Union.	71.8511209958761
It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed.	50.671326725255355
We believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking.	60.90712752895039
We therefore have a number of amendments.	16.473076071781797
I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective.	31.8362134388546
I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive.	17.812894914161717
Nor do I think that motorcycles should be included, as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motorcycle industry obviates the need for a European directive in this area.	39.394696130045986
I am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either.	103.74132481752945
I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas.	129.0202203657064
This is my main concern in this matter.	16.177907607080844
In my opinion, the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe.	45.0615751023668
This can be left as the Commission has proposed with the Member States ensuring the appropriate collection points for draining cars.	61.34260515054411
This will involve, for example, disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil, removing break fluid, etc.	84.82245785074667
An important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts.	61.7911545146579
What should we do with the shredded products?	35.844333236688776
We should not overlook the fact that, although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery, they are by no means the only point.	62.885400465185285
Do not forget that, in the case of cars, 80% of environmental impact comes through driving, 1% through recovery and 19% through construction.	95.89600949943915
Quotas are not, therefore, the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility, just one of many.	60.559782618034994
Of course we need to aim high, but quotas must not become an end in themselves.	54.391814541063056
We must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars.	30.206956127339318
I am far keener to see us move away from today's car, weighing 1,400 kg and driving an average of 200,000 km, to a future car capable of driving the same distance but weighing just 1,000 kg.	105.9476171039552
This would at least mean 400 kg times 200,000 km less transportation.	90.17286359099168
This would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which, if I have rightly understood the Kyoto Protocol, is the important factor.	67.19636744674767
We therefore consider that, in future, vehicles which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction methods will produce less CO2 and should receive preferential treatment in their combustion quotas.	128.79917813084865
It should not be for each Member State, but for you and your staff, Commissioner, to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles (and there is also talk of 3-litre vehicles) should receive preferential treatment.	95.50320008863413
We think they should.	133.28394854186445
May I say something about costs.	133.75712530342886
Some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer.	54.21536024938496
However, this can be seriously questioned as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consumers and acquire for themselves a state-sanctioned monopoly on recycling.	154.96319207822626
I can only warn you against consenting to this.	52.444209955796566
There are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car.	86.12252308553126
The money from this pool, system, or however you want to picture it, would mean that from 2006 all vehicles in circulation could be taken in without cost to the last holder.	148.54236857423368
This too is a particular desire of my group.	67.70947822220457
Our proposal to split the costs has a crucial advantage, namely that we won't be an immediate candidate for the Court of Justice when the directive is adopted.	111.18515774746275
The car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions, which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly.	64.50355833856696
This is why I propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer.	57.45223259384107
As for a ban on certain materials: of course we need one!	97.33126191012467
A car has dangerous components which we must ban long-term.	174.7683195185456
This means that we need a pressure instrument.	43.47079107140976
The Commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives.	35.69998438492896
There are a number of sound amendments.	30.444496448045623
This Parliament has been given more authority, so let us use it!	54.6445370413311
Let us have the courage to put together a ground-breaking directive.	56.41705956766749
A directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this House.	48.46144520211374
I ask for your support.	44.68444241936402
Mr President, I almost feel like saying, "Phew" , now that we have at last come to the second reading on this directive which has given us so much work, and which has clearly also given a great deal of work to the rapporteur, Mr Florenz.	51.227899905777015
I do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been abandoned and which, today, can only be removed at local authority expense, i.e. the taxpayers' expense.	75.6890464670243
The principle of 'polluter pays' is not being applied.	21.929561138565273
Vehicles already abandoned have also been abandoned by Community legislation, in that they are not taken into consideration either in the texts on emissions or in this text on end-of-life vehicles.	91.5112002940467
The only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future.	23.08257264479427
It has not, however, been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recycle.	84.12031668758507
On the other hand, we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find (a) materials that are easier to recycle and (b) to set up recycling industries.	51.04412128742867
I should also like to stress the need to maintain a flexible approach to recycling, reuse and incineration, as far as the new particularly light materials are concerned which make it possible to reduce vehicle consumption and therefore emissions.	51.79075934875083
This is a problem of compatibility between our directives on end-of-life vehicles and the former directives, including the one on auto-oil, which we voted on a few years ago.	61.56845298105472
We must therefore congratulate the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on having the wisdom, in order to make things perfectly clear, to reintroduce the clause making an exception of the vintage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage.	35.677053153722476
In conclusion, let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserved for the wrecks which still clutter our forests, lakes and gardens.	46.06141455280646
Once again, the principle of 'polluter pays' is not being applied. The taxpayer is still footing the bill.	51.46028998394955
Mr President, Commissioner, reading the leaflets which have been distributed in recent weeks, one would think that we were talking about the ultimate environmental catastrophe or the death of the car industry in Europe.	32.535700118867055
Neither is correct.	302.9202305417269
We simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive.	49.544045003570815
It means ecological progress for Europe, and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion.	74.02866768119772
All the same, there is one point on which we are in conflict.	38.775875595531424
In the grand scheme of the directive, it is perhaps a minor point, but nevertheless a disputed one.	81.87411120949467
It concerns the issue of recycling costs.	64.90350512893205
Here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year's debate in the Council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs.	110.4458627163072
Last February in this House we unambiguously decided (and we Social Democrats are sticking to this) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question!	84.748998388411
So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of?	65.60096538915752
For us this is straightforward: in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars.	77.9611192907976
And what about vehicles which are already on the road?	86.9970072172975
Let us look at an example. Rover in Great Britain, if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars, would actually be responsible for 5.8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs, whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts, as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it.	96.27744152699364
Such distortions in competition are not about environmental protection; they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in Europe.	117.65391628282339
Consequently, for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs.	88.76165658245824
I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full whack and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds.	83.4923969543938
However, I would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from building cars in Europe, so that these jobs can be secured in the future.	46.53711906785379
I am in favour of stringent environmental requirements, as you know from the auto-oil programme and the debate on exhaust emissions, but I believe that they should be the same for everyone!	35.796268856033166
Mr President, Commissioner, I think we need this directive.	17.106584919011723
Firstly, because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives.	105.3767213715401
Secondly, because it can promote recycling, which is important.	99.38445226442046
Thirdly, because it sets out a clear procedure to combat pollution caused by heavy metals.	71.47489271426444
This is also an important point.	12.406424759392191
The directive affords a European framework, also to Member States who already have systems in place and who wish to continue to use these.	85.38852656399702
So, first of all, we need to keep the recycling percentages at their present level. This will, of course, provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dispose of.	57.5220235341613
Secondly, we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position.	29.078918905746793
As from 2006, therefore, all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners.	371.33326681960546
Needless to say, this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way.	35.26262192678318
Is this too much of a burden?	155.22906238274146
There is, however, one thing we should not overlook.	24.648809504601417
The directive applies to complete cars, that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing.	123.36946574033898
According to the experts, few of these complete cars are of no value.	107.33116512126666
After all, recycling and the re-use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss-making.	118.08979083207261
Quite the reverse, in fact. At present, there is a whole raft of companies which make a living out of them, and a decent one at that.	55.92644589071239
This directive encourages the whole of this sector.	31.63214351158452
It is a sector which comprises small and medium-sized businesses.	17.979768958266853
Since, in this case, transport costs are high, a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentralised, because transporting an end-of-life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km is not a profitable activity.	80.59366371795727
I think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles, and I think we ought to add this provision to it.	33.72004251222908
I think, therefore, that vintage cars ought to be exempt.	40.45965171070741
Also, it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer.	53.08724555694078
That is a basic principle which we must uphold.	35.50152973183474
As manufacturers are responsible for the design, they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase.	56.55261867776314
We must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer, as stipulated in the common position.	45.5430319722797
I find this a well-balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things.	37.91299618523612
I think we need to retain it.	20.049705858803634
This is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence.	42.381975895263594
After all, we are all aware how difficult it was within the Council to bring this common position about, and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position.	42.918269996910965
In my opinion, we should not jeopardise that common position, because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons.	37.732949139016284
I would ask you to support this common position.	13.529577126416127
Our group will, at any rate, do this as far as possible - for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well-balanced and encompasses a whole range of issues and difficulties including, for example, the way in which the costs are to be distributed.	45.35372107869572
Mr President, we need to take an important decision today.	25.739526371515645
Does this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer' s liability, that is to say that cars, once they have reached the end of their lives, are the responsibility of the car manufacturer?	76.27486291696889
No, according to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No. 38: car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50/50.	173.9759289411081
It is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50/50 compromise is included that this does not work.	79.2285241693696
Packaging still accounts for a mountain of rubbish in Europe and is a burden upon the environment.	87.0763596567985
Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say: yes, we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45.	85.6225181328093
The common position stipulates 2006.	28.399374513236122
According to the group of the Greens, this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations.	35.49976075303536
I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialists.	29.686381916986942
If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars, they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply.	68.35783866852194
The problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant-based bioplastic.	56.51986400318195
This is ultimately cheaper, also for the consumer.	64.87259503714702
For twenty years, the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener.	60.65069832217244
Today, this green position is being threatened under pressure from, in particular, the German and French car industries.	96.09567729554438
That is why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45.	22.351987326526952
We, the Green Group, by and large support the common position.	262.17373552713303
Mr President, the waste from end-of-life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances.	101.12745431573286
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area.	38.44384219321884
With this directive, we have the chance to take a big step forward, but this presupposes that the Council' s position is not torn to shreds and weakened in Parliament' s reading of it.	42.78552466972224
If they were adopted, many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive.	52.05546823429764
This applies, above all, to amendments from the Group of the European People' s Party but also, unfortunately, to some of the amendments from Mr Lange, as I see it.	45.23140554009629
It is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries, for example in Germany, went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted.	61.77177003425634
For ourselves, it is crucial that the following principles should apply.	77.60786962078798
The polluter should pay.	49.63717729183608
This means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility, financial as well as otherwise, for recycling vehicles.	86.14268905794911
There must be rules governing existing vehicles too.	131.8111303905434
Where this aspect is concerned, we cannot accept any weakening of the Council' s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force.	36.88020056962375
There should be no falling-off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years, and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead.	65.31642686533763
We shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations.	37.860785807708844
If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive, this would be very detrimental, not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament' s credibility on environmental issues.	58.322506420700996
Reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries, for example my own country, Sweden.	48.58457173324267
I was myself a car worker before I was elected.	129.34953458852144
I believe I am one of the few members of this Parliament to have stood beside a production line and assembled cars.	43.49276882302852
I think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry.	28.62515042866596
These would, of course, be to the advantage of modern, progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms.	153.55664751219717
It is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the European Union.	22.959347827464796
Mr President, I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament, as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe.	25.155107056022278
There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment.	40.228321264317
Our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests.	63.79309104436796
Each year, there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the European Union. This in itself generates a large amount of waste.	90.31581538136551
Car manufacturers, the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars.	75.83868456142467
We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union.	51.423483616146676
From an Irish perspective, I know that the Irish Department of the Environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in Ireland in the near future to deal with end-of-life vehicles.	59.57110260625748
I see no reason why licensing arrangements cannot be organised across Europe for collection centres to scrap the 8 to 9 million vehicles which are disposed of within the European Union on an annual basis.	87.23777759779071
Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use, recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years.	54.01737395013317
In accordance with new provisions included in the Amsterdam Treaty all the 370 million consumers within the European Union have a right to consumer-related information.	63.72878746737583
I believe EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practices in the coming year.	164.4743437334681
My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations.	40.42271348215844
Mr President, the directive on end-of-life vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in Europe.	27.038543467183743
I also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials, a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation.	71.8824769109453
In this regard, we are certainly on the right track, but as some Members have already stressed, the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers' responsibility will become a shared responsibility.	70.78204789303442
I would like to say that in Italy, considerable headway has been made in this sector; we are perhaps the first in Europe to have regulations encouraging us to take end-of-life vehicles off the market, but in our country the average age of cars on the road is rather high, and we therefore have serious concerns over the problems that this directive could entail for the market.	77.6837696593104
We need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter.	37.25262869360381
In Italy, we have begun to withdraw and recycle around 80% of old cars, but there is a market problem which could trigger a crisis - in terms of unemployment given that in Italy industry often resorts to lay-offs and redundancies - and cause problems for workers in different parts of Italy.	91.1415235002025
We must therefore try to reconcile the two requirements - Parliament is sometimes a little extremist, adopting positions that are either extremely pro-green or extremely anti-green - and, all things considered, find a way to combine the effort made by Mr Florenz and that of other Members, who are trying to reconcile the two positions as best as possible.	119.48515739351468
These worthwhile amendments are the outcome of this; I think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem, that is, to reconcile environmental requirements with market and labour requirements.	46.34089169192874
Mr President, this directive deals with the comparatively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life.	70.9265504052146
To that extent, it might be thought desirable, even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity.	49.77944121380721
The key questions now are who pays the EUR 262 per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year?	126.6780183568847
Who pays for the collection, the dismantling, the disposal and so on?	187.25806243400407
And should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made?	94.34155211193732
The proposal from the Council, the common position, is that manufacturers should pay the lot.	68.74230475870647
That would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the European Union.	36.04623388790744
That cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars.	53.04221845116331
Because European car manufactures have been operating here for many, many more decades than companies from Japan, Korea and elsewhere, that would be a much greater burden on the older European companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere.	115.2775920176861
I commend Mr Florenz, Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs.	84.66179491664512
I also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleagues from Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and Britain, to remove the retrospective nature of this measure.	76.98336086790403
Retrospective law is bad law, it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law.	208.36345678343218
Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest, which clearly there is not in this case.	103.91435863808766
That is why I have called for a roll-call vote on this.	41.97367623506571
We can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality, which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry.	59.83794524389677
Mr President, once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive, and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange.	28.68328816082518
These amendments actually have the advantage - and I should like to stress this - of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives.	51.67173928351655
The Council' s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all, or a significant part, of the costs of recovery and recycling.	54.85974381341556
But, as Mr Lange so rightly said, this solution is totally unfair to European car manufacturers.	109.88210896078444
Coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry, I can tell you that it is not possible, retroactively, to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road, i.e. effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80% of the total number of cars in Europe.	89.00255737878093
This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs.	97.7258583455812
The common position puts European car manufacturers in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the European market.	60.094663239173144
Of course, we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby. We are here to build a Europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive.	71.30886848484829
This is why, I urge you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange. These amendments will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting Member States the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints, since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the Members States, and some of them work perfectly well, will be able to continue to operate.	63.16784217465733
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed directive on end-of-life vehicles before us today aims firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union, but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector.	32.51796443171359
Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must, of course, be exempt from the scope of this directive.	49.16873479376427
Cars are also part of our cultural heritage. I think we would all agree on that.	58.18140087383036
Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force.	54.263246174379354
Parliament' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive' s entry into force, for new vehicles, is not terribly realistic.	81.91530942381674
The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling.	55.543506498279115
The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road.	99.45124749204778
This would, furthermore, make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses.	72.52554790869172
Like my group, I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which, I feel, offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection.	98.63755996051813
Mr President, the European Parliament is today facing an important decision.	24.57760425958047
Will we give our backing to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection or, as the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others cause me to fear, will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the German car industry?	122.34637427348385
The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake.	29.455466000845856
It would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection!	49.915436097997
The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious: to sabotage the directive!	89.3324571187865
The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation.	106.5480216318936
In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more.	143.2022142623016
This is totally unacceptable.	22.939677461915053
I therefore appeal to the German delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today!	63.2902207903557
The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive.	90.35079169283733
Do not continue in this vein!	47.011358474000765
The whinging about competitive disadvantages is laughable if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the German car industry.	108.20480397597208
Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers!	343.48821859700064
Vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry!	74.39783072674456
Mr President, this directive has been under discussion since 1997.	31.255866857676125
It is high time that we reached an agreement.	32.07838135990096
Since I more or less share the views of my colleague, Mr Sjöstedt and the representative of the Greens, Mr de Roo, I am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me, and I will highlight just two issues.	41.26078482830719
Firstly, and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal, the idea, which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste, that we should use materials which will subsequently cause less pollution.	81.87789823707146
Another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed, not only in the case of lead, cadmium and mercury, but also in the case of waste which contains PVC.	38.102322563418156
Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context.	42.15660693663973
The other question is who should bear the cost.	91.28265927743843
I agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay, and this proposal expresses that idea very well.	43.09623344347075
Producers must pay - although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequences of this - and they must take responsibility for the costs before 2006, as some of the amendments propose.	64.69712955210443
We are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading.	45.316917176748696
It is also important to set percentages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recyclable materials.	35.96855835609817
I believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines.	32.44936182659709
Lastly, Mr President, I believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized businesses which, if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised, can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area, preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies.	67.53039682348214
Mr President, today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibilities.	24.39630150997814
We have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year.	36.666040015089855
In some of our Member States, voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our ditches, canals and fields are not filled with these ugly and dangerous wrecks, inhabited occasionally by an alarmed farmyard chicken.	38.97653561125726
I come, of course, from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in Europe and in third countries.	67.08399505734432
I can gauge its importance for my country' s international reputation.	76.63574742160476
I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end-of-life vehicles.	86.24947072514293
I am aware of the difficulties the Council experienced in finding a compromise.	44.184126803596115
That is why, today, we must be understanding alchemists, concerned for our environment.	73.96035915239231
This will either be the century of waste management or it will not.	96.34623726964094
As far as I am concerned, at least, the principle of 'polluter pays' must be applied.	21.609076644924066
The car industry, increasingly more respectful of the environment, has, I am sure, anticipated this kind of increasing awareness.	85.38787510372454
Indeed it is accepting its responsibilities.	65.26350131064645
It is the Member States, however, who will have to implement this directive, and let us beware of going into too much detail because the industrial traditions, the demolition and crushing sectors vary according to whether you are in Italy or in Finland.	58.26730123273768
I am opposed to making the car owners liable.	115.90560918453477
The men and women on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their catalytic converter, pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement.	115.137946387109
It would certainly be unwise for my fellow Members in the major groups of the federalist tendency to seek to make the European Parliament unpopular in this way by creating a liability shared between the owner and the manufacturer.	52.5345767522402
How, furthermore, can a fund be created which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operations within Europe.	132.02374294290726
Who is to pay for recycling the car I bought in France if I register it in Belgium?	164.04363596043385
Which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle?	280.99199125629275
Let us beware, too, of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application.	125.15376654989215
It is not our intention to start a punitive legislative campaign here today, but to continue on our present course, advocating sustainable development.	76.00296858879256
Mr President, most of the time, the European Parliament, spearheaded by environment committees, does its very best to make a critical assessment of the proposals submitted by the European Commission or the Council, so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view.	48.72778025103308
Now, a sound common position submitted by the Council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in Parliament.	50.41287511603151
Every year, we discard a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances.	54.571145995687765
This is why it is important to prevent waste materials.	22.90799414687544
We should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals, as well as of other dangerous substances and materials.	57.3625828106988
In addition, car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantling and re-use.	122.27831125262453
What is left of the stripped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately.	69.70973255348474
I therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for re-use and recycling which have been proposed by the Council.	62.28977665487955
These days, the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is economically viable.	95.40151907021698
This means that we move away from shredding.	22.30234839845715
The prescribed objectives are most certainly viable and, in the Netherlands, a value of 86% recycling has now already been achieved.	89.00956020914012
The best way of achieving proper collection is to ensure that the last holder and/or owner can deliver the car to an authorised treatment facility without any cost.	65.56297000850543
The processing cost can then be incorporated in the price of new cars.	60.564085466931274
The proposals made by a few MEPs impact greatly on this system.	86.4198632721375
The so-called shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation.	48.382329544224646
If the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied, it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably.	138.6500251340356
Finally, this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity.	36.942075472027554
A laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay, at the expense of the environment.	40.09147740989641
Why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled? If we are, then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the Council on the result achieved.	76.36879345404142
Mr President, I hold Mr Florenz in high esteem.	65.83423474744343
He has delivered excellent work under pressure both from his colleagues and from the car industry.	88.32918010148016
Add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and, against that background, find a compromise. That was not easy.	79.87760680714061
Overall, I am not dissatisfied with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlying that common position.	62.44745632163067
I would like to comment on two things. Firstly, vintage cars and motorbikes.	34.041098659237385
These should indeed be excluded from the directive. Secondly, the controversial question as to who bears the responsibility for taking back cars.	126.09639110231645
I do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way.	20.803613261091055
The manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and/or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost.	95.04825484765429
In my opinion, there is too much initial hesitation.	19.71191637106624
The car lobby has led too many people up the garden path.	84.55375334963463
I would also like to mention that experience has nonetheless taught us that the processing cost is in fact passed on.	31.16004744247552
These costs are not very high.	41.47616295154032
In the Member State where I come from, you are talking about 150 Guilders per car.	48.68737935009438
If you charge this from day one, you can process the old cars straight away.	428.04973303544836
A very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards, which used to be a common feature in our Member States, would then disappear.	83.94429045076798
I do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise.	27.485267427958792
I think it would be a good thing if we were to approve the present legislation together as soon as possible.	19.545893384171084
This is positive because, in that way, the nine million cars which are introduced each year onto European roads will actually be processed appropriately, and this will benefit us all.	87.2181038613185
Mr President, the present directive is important in so far as it helps prevent our being faced with hazardous waste from end-of-life vehicles and in so far as it promotes the re-use and recycling of materials from scrapped cars.	85.11717651230929
I therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers' liability.	41.88758174834956
If we do reduce it, we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste.	148.13565090585988
The common position, which was arrived at with great difficulty in the Council, which the Commission has endorsed and which was also maintained in Parliament' s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, complies fully with the environmental requirements. I therefore find it incomprehensible and very curious to see amendments from members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the objectives of which are to weaken the environmental requirements and significantly reduce car manufacturers' liability.	43.69223596853264
If these amendments are adopted, I think that we shall cause Parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues.	70.25436223733874
So far, we here in Parliament have been positive catalysts for environmental protection but now, if the amendments proposed by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange are adopted, we are to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe.	57.285855392278464
What is more, if we reduce manufacturers' liability on this issue, this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas, for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from computers and other electronic equipment.	67.78132125260757
I would therefore recommend to Members of Parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers' liability.	86.1320510217877
We shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result.	39.5634628234114
Mr President, this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars, encourage recycling, and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled.	141.28565028129734
Now who should pay the costs?	139.03215779492214
Whatever system is adopted, ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer.	79.35908287074075
The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars.	89.28569781625654
The manufacturers have tricked Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals.	213.52639848908322
Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers!	44.62725854805355
If you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments.	131.8934928147182
Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is not a technical debate, contrary to what we may think.	43.56846964411136
It has become eminently political.	62.62410623635227
Yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate.	90.56663450517695
Today, if 314 Members of Parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturers, we should be doing ourselves dishonour.	75.78052108783697
In expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end-of-life vehicles, as Amendment No 38 stipulates, even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer, Parliament would, for the first time, not be acting as the defender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of Europe, it would be turning into mere sounding box for different lobbies.	77.98019227464287
We cannot accept this.	20.99451508368939
It would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas.	39.916023315015664
It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weakening a Council position, whereas usually we are complaining that their position is not strong enough.	43.7577457148582
The free recovery system, for example, for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly.	122.61567271814724
Thus, for the consumer, for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling, the Council' s common position definitely must not be amended. It is, as it stands, perfectly acceptable.	73.15720693412223
Mr President, like so many others here today, I believe this is a good measure.	31.621262723699658
This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need.	34.851575586818456
Most of the technical issues have been resolved.	40.571375165059315
There are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved.	51.402878157907544
We have arrived at the final question.	36.81646303877595
In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament. That is quite simply: Who pays?	65.26574199361006
The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost, not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said.	77.53089767305894
In fact perhaps as little, the lawyers tell us, as 20% or one-fifth of the cost. That is not unreasonable.	113.34700659009462
If you look at the UK consumer for example, who buys a Rover, as Mr Lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars, over and above comparable prices in other parts of Europe, why should they pay?	149.53909579203875
They have paid already.	205.03831989152184
Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers, pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from?	210.76791493183546
I cannot accept that.	20.51816940980064
There are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case.	50.50246284314403
I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it.	23.110877019198032
The responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer.	100.19292984503039
It is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal.	53.96126465961252
The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government.	27.502658032142683
The common position is a reasonable compromise.	26.643871359532596
Some of the amendments today are totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road.	129.72687888467541
I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments.	36.103670945723984
Mr President, there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will properly deal with end-of-life cars, although in this instance the Council has not provided a model for a suitable European environment policy.	47.0038606648922
It is disgraceful the way in which the German Presidency handled this matter.	26.03853386951009
Firstly, Herr Trittin, the Environment Minister, was not in tune with his colleagues in the Cabinet, then Chancellor Schröder blundered in like a bull in a china shop, having no expert knowledge of this process.	97.81271145197883
Mind you, even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best result that could have been done achieved.	91.24240571394378
There are certain weaknesses, the greatest of which, in my opinion, is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses; after all, the car industry is more than just large companies.	55.6316131353508
It is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium-sized enterprises.	27.832152083119368
For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector.	63.105613206241436
The plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs.	52.03550277992095
The common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint.	35.13977926915504
It fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow delegate from the Greens says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has toned down a common position, I really must object, because quite simply, it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern, low-consumption cars such as the 3-litre car, which contain a great deal of plastic, by means of rigid, high recycling quotas!	74.05920815007599
Consequently, we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars.	76.888637774321
The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation.	57.856414260941676
However, the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing CO2 levels in Europe in other sectors besides these.	52.15405509524279
Mr President, we are indeed now in a very rare situation: those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the Council in their common position.	56.83712623162591
In contrast to what the previous speaker said, I can say I am really proud that a common position was achieved during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental values.	44.46358687877959
If we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs, we will be creating a loophole: we will not have created a rational, clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order.	63.78533469229554
That is why, in my opinion, the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility.	30.32195113419046
Only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem, taking into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encouraged to make vehicles whose parts can be recycled at the smallest possible cost in the future.	70.45534702406064
Mr President, there are two issues of principle in the Council' s draft directive.	28.06238252562205
The first concerns the manufacturer' s unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicles.	68.16797294925738
There is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade.	73.34743249191145
This particularly applies in areas within the EU where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles.	83.70985562538186
I believe that, quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned, the EU' s directives should not treat small companies within the Union unfairly.	45.141190349852536
Unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts disappears, for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts.	84.72330058936645
Yet the trade in used car parts is important, especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles.	211.3271449913551
The principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy.	36.42024209283519
It should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up.	23.00812854544139
They should be able to establish themselves in new markets, but also to leave old markets.	79.4006057013206
To bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development.	110.01873747699972
The second principle in the Council' s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive.	26.313967406644863
It conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product.	222.0605931761501
To do so also changes the owner' s liability retroactively.	124.30653460700236
Over the years, a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways.	72.41441461264988
Every country within the EU now has rules governing the scrapping of cars.	76.62241047047071
Some may be better than others, and some worse.	94.54645860217246
In anticipation of this EU directive' s being implemented, EU countries ought however to be individually liable for scrapping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the EU legislation is not applied.	73.5305087494122
This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds.	107.37841418535477
Mr President, everyone agrees with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question.	90.12252725457098
The common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restricts the opportunities for improvement, and puts the whole directive at risk.	113.14251126237545
I therefore maintain that Parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument.	38.560230262752285
I would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive; the costs are not excessive: recycling a car costs less than 1% of the price of a new car.	72.67004057929562
Moreover, the manufacturers will not be financially accountable until 2006, when a good number of the existing vehicles will no longer be on the market.	89.35026445401306
As for the remaining vehicles, we could nevertheless provide for some means of sharing costs, as is proposed in Amendments Nos 44 and 45 by Mr Lange, the only ones that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trials underway in some countries, and we should therefore support them.	69.63056616589806
Mr President, this is an extremely bad directive.	26.45403622105736
First of all, as my colleague Mr Bowis has pointed out, it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle.	22.69657606348894
Secondly, it dumps huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment.	98.51666252516912
In this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment.	40.42046800099152
I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect, which has not been examined well enough in this debate. It is like so much European legislation.	57.03871563540336
It is far too prescriptive.	17.022026478822777
It sets in stone one particular model of recycling.	231.0572642380553
The production line was invented about a hundred years ago, I believe, by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles, to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them.	76.80428502526892
One thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars.	56.90117734586343
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so.	62.3540553969135
There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars, recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts.	94.30880830962643
This is a very environmentally reasonable approach.	26.132563052932703
It is just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery.	123.63087600235859
This method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the "dead" car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and reclamation process.	150.31699046900536
I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive, it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally, and are certainly very damaging economically.	71.70829080812851
Mr President, the common position is sound, but it is up to Parliament to improve the common position on end-of-life vehicles.	32.03201398872788
The Social-Democratic Group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days.	36.24209058049588
I would especially draw your attention to Amendment No 45, in which a choice is made in favour of laying the cost of disassembly and recycling at the door of the manufacturer, for new cars at any rate.	51.68318536904226
Consequently, consideration will also be given to recycling during the conception phase and production.	83.43214291882752
For the cars currently on the road, it would be reasonable to share the cost, for example by setting up a fund such as that in the Netherlands.	54.54022814502756
The common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost, they should also take back end-of-life vehicles.	59.19371171670955
This is a big problem in my opinion.	20.31442692943481
I urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles, as they would gain an excessive hold over the second-hand components market.	138.1161973610934
They would then determine their own prices.	86.20062574177403
Anyone who has been in an old car knows that this is to the detriment of the consumer and the amateur mechanic.	35.20611158934132
The European consumer organisation, which has asked us to support the common position on this point, is to my mind letting the consumer down.	57.081895481499345
A second argument for keeping the dismantling of cars out of the manufacturers' clutches is the cost of transport.	100.94948152025256
If car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies, this will necessitate transporting end-of-life vehicles over long distances.	145.5068520840016
This is environmentally unfriendly but also expensive and does not benefit the consumer either.	86.10889011351429
I would therefore appreciate your support for Amendment No 45.	19.66744647264624
Mr President, Commissioner, I have asked to speak again so that I can say a few more words at the close of this debate.	25.048327917446915
If you travel to the Netherlands, you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost-free.	163.69607277046356
You will also find that these cars are suitably disposed of, that new material flows have been opened up in order to recycle materials, that 85% of the weight of a car is recycled and that 92% of all cars in the Netherlands are recycled.	77.2693362283904
This is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes.	35.82995327965794
Should this be condemned ecologically, Frau Breyer?	51.37142816809947
I do not think so.	22.384486642791376
The Netherlands has an exemplary model for disposing of cars as per the wishes of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or, in the case of end-of-life vehicles currently driving around, the manufacturer, has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with ecology; it is a simple question of competition!	69.40704164745944
The issue here is whether a European manufacturer should pay EUR 250 million or a Korean manufacturer, say, EUR 2 million.	100.9174758464807
In terms of the people who build cars here in Europe, I am in favour of not making competition unequal but, in terms of environmental protection, I want freedom from costs for the last owner, to be financed by a special fund, and manufacturer responsibility for new cars, which will force them to assume responsibility for building recyclable cars!	97.58285656118571
(Applause from the PSE Group)	21.4213999689991
Mr President, the proposal we are discussing has a huge amount of advantages, mainly in the interests of preventing waste and encouraging re-use, the recovery and recycling of components and the recovery of materials, etc. I think we have tabled a sound proposal.	75.33685890437879
The main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer, the vendor, or whoever, should take the end-of-life vehicle back without any cost.	52.55379395238401
I will only give the example of my own country to illustrate how this system functions there without any problems.	48.05613305223027
We have reached an agreement with all the parties involved.	30.563674698940854
These include car manufacturers, second-hand car dealers, the federation of the car industry, the metal processing firms, shredding firms and the government.	171.1701744111937
An environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis.	41.18433109808716
The car industry - and Belgium produces a great many cars- did not have any problem with that.	72.80648860451859
Belgians can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost.	83.48463392124282
In connection with this, we have noticed how - quite contrary to what has been said here to the effect that the scheme would be to the detriment of employment - a number of small businesses have taken the recycling of materials to heart and are doing very well.	54.811867286781265
Some businesses have become hi-tech businesses, because they managed to recycle certain materials, even materials which are not yet included in the directive.	103.44908618660378
So this means that we are developing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a huge favour into the bargain.	87.0572619791787
I am in favour of collection free of charge.	36.77673016061368
It worked for us.	58.61164177651937
Why would it not work elsewhere?	95.39929003778492
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for an interesting debate in which many important arguments have been presented.	22.753644760029
Would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes.	104.47578741221898
Allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumptions and principles behind the present directive.	34.79132740012336
Allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate.	26.149272332457482
First of all, I think I should repeat some of the basic facts which Mr Florenz and others have already mentioned.	31.50752938404534
What we are discussing here is the fact that close on ten million cars are scrapped every year in the European Union, resulting in approximately as many millions of tons of waste.	52.67492108380062
This means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars, and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open.	65.50275414607019
Moreover, they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind.	165.55373833312842
Approximately ten per cent of lead production is to be found in cars, but also cadmium, chromium, mercury and other very dangerous substances.	66.23706269428635
This is something you already know, but I would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who are listening.	51.80482549302765
Cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in Europe.	63.3083308583124
We know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it, and there is no excuse for not taking action.	62.93261629624714
The present directive has three aims. First of all, we want to stop heavy metals from being used in the manufacture of new cars.	86.19330960053284
Secondly, we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable.	32.75950670626118
We can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product' s life-cycle. Instead, we should avoid creating so much waste.	66.53249579695877
We should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product.	48.0687608484593
Thirdly, we wish to achieve the recycling objectives specified in the present directive.	56.586876364929594
These are the three most important aims of the directive.	30.91923136444313
This is, of course, because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recycled.	45.78268417381095
It is, above all, the manufacturer' s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car' s life-cycle.	37.75938933998673
Two important questions have arisen in this regard. Yes, there are in fact more than two questions, but I want to mention just two of the most important.	39.29257336759958
First of all: who should pay?	42.07035789805772
And secondly: are we reducing the European car industry' s competitiveness by means of the present proposal?	59.338687117349494
The first question, then, is about who should pay.	132.55911463929323
The directive states that the polluter should pay and that the cost is to be borne mainly by the manufacturer in accordance with the principles to be found in the EU' s treaty concerning the manufacturer' s liability.	40.80645869289454
It is nonetheless clear that the cost will be borne jointly by manufacturers and consumers.	43.628790214370795
We have calculated that the cost of recycling cars does not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car.	45.67671980528405
Do we imagine, then, that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive?	53.119669995212135
No. Clearly, we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment, but it will be very much greater.	41.59967821504743
Moreover, the cost will have to be borne in the future.	21.331161430257996
The cost will not therefore disappear, but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed.	63.48387413413326
Are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis?	55.211688486004846
Is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it?	56.48427324477038
Is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these?	57.52158467762363
Is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the European car industry?	29.344365777232564
No, of course not.	284.09851995479295
It is quite the opposite.	23.51787146780126
Do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly cars and more fuel-efficient cars is going to decline in the future?	75.39550873318711
What kind of requirements do you think our children and grandchildren and future legislators are going to make of cars?	76.65095072260986
Naturally, that they should be environmentally friendly, that they should be recyclable, that they should be fuel-efficient and that they should not pollute our environment.	36.80984522610879
It is, of course, only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry.	20.92395650474118
We must create forms of motive power which are not damaging to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste, recycle materials and compete by means of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient cars.	68.60529462181746
The fact that we have a European car industry which has already made great strides more than properly compensates for the fact that there are, in fact, a good many cars on European roads for which they must take responsibility.	34.8225966223919
The cost is not insurmountable; nor is the task an impossible one.	70.77796407806923
If we develop motive power of the kind I have described, I am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the workload.	89.6546015907231
These will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling systems.	124.8385869956379
The industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in Europe.	55.35638658552163
They will not represent an insurmountable cost for the European car industry.	33.9587557742542
They will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually producing environmentally friendly and more fuel-efficient cars.	89.50975129178119
We must do this for the sake of the environment.	14.621331547993394
The costs will not disappear. Nor will the waste disappear.	92.3420247422846
But, otherwise, we must all of us, as taxpayers or citizens, foot the bill. What is more, the costs will be higher the longer we wait before taking action.	126.63290401681482
That is what I should like to say by way of introduction.	22.516116642997748
I also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retroactive legislation.	23.36405255472558
If we assume that, on average, a car has a life of eleven years, do Members, indeed does anyone, believe that we should wait for eleven years before we get to grips with this problem?	75.07002644308601
Do you think that, when we legislate about chemicals, we should say that we are ignoring those chemicals which are already on the market and that we are legislating only for what is to be produced in the future?	35.49545293894691
Clearly, we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars.	58.201545817652786
It is still not an insurmountable problem.	18.466334999999592
We can deal with it.	23.35224067177409
We already have an infrastructure.	92.23680396390735
We have what we require in order to deal with end-of-life cars.	55.4921489533289
I naturally hope that the result of today' s vote will be a good one.	25.571243761756094
If I have not already done so, I would also thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	20.01814779168113
In fact, it is in many respects pioneering work when it comes to re-use and manufacturer' s liability.	36.15205326878109
I believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment.	26.106053318444793
We cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters.	28.755080880878445
As I have said, we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues.	30.192275022930815
After the first reading in the European Parliament in 1999, the Commission' s proposal ended up in an awkward political situation in the Council.	24.30387784153726
However, we obtained a well-balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency.	51.716811350982105
Now, we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully.	43.20460572191264
A total of 48 amendments have been tabled.	47.17956021404083
The Commission can adopt 10 amendments in their entirety.	57.21790613800541
Three amendments can be partially approved, and one can be approved in principle.	68.12930294489858
Certain amendments concern improvements to the Commission' s proposal which we adopted as early as at the first reading or else they reintroduce into the directive such parts of the original proposal as the Council has removed.	73.91399752179633
This applies to Amendment No 5, excluding section 1; 8 and 9, section 1; 10 and 12, section 3; 15, 16, 20, 22, 24 and 25.	59.82385162374447
These amendments can all be approved.	48.25948543015229
Amendments Nos 6 and 21 are new; the Commission can approve these.	74.64789218342861
The Commission can also approve Amendment No 26 with certain editorial changes.	31.944963459016385
I want to emphasise that a number of the other amendments affecting the proposal' s basic components involve a considerable watering-down of the level of environmental protection aimed at by the common position.	50.16016642963968
They cannot therefore be approved.	23.64407701853404
Parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in Europe.	35.80212399879212
It would amaze and depress me if it were not to do so today.	36.42688539436665
I am very concerned about certain amendments from Parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question.	52.84119615580772
These concern, for example, the phasing-out of heavy metals, manufacturer' s liability and the requirement for recycling.	60.62742178201581
I want to deal with these amendments on a group-by-group basis.	73.88644111632935
Amendments Nos 4, 11, 12, 13, 28, 30, 32, 37, 42 and 48 concern the phasing-out of heavy metals.	37.758156012155425
Amendment No 12 involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force.	62.28392561992117
Amendments Nos 13, 28, 32, 37, 42 and 48 involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions.	55.75028968701379
This would mean that the process of replacing dangerous substances would be implemented more slowly.	28.89092512790953
Amendments Nos 4, 11 and 30 mean that heavy metals have to be separated from the waste before recycling.	62.56157762948723
The Commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view.	33.135125089511675
Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 34, 36, 38, 44 and 45 relate to the manufacturer' s liability.	37.41776728724697
The compromise reached by the Council is fair but fragile.	66.8740980476357
The Commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without, at the same time, creating tensions.	34.128913555884694
I regret the confusion which arose recently due to internal documents from the Commission being wrongly used, so creating uncertainty about the Commission' s attitude to the issue.	81.81182608583299
I want to emphasise that, as early as 1997, the Commission proposed a special clause concerning manufacturer' s liability and that the Commission entirely supports the common position.	44.41566464714171
This does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers. Far from it.	90.24383783176947
Amendments Nos 39, 40, 46 and 47 concern quantified objectives.	116.03467674174433
The high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year 2006 were removed.	71.0456643527273
These amendments would also make the objectives awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise.	54.329124387545946
Allow me also - listen carefully to what I am saying now, because I have heard this reiterated in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and "cherished" cars as mentioned in Amendments Nos 3, 7, and 9, section 2, and 35.	48.30579610503815
Such vehicles are not covered by the definition of waste and are not therefore included under the directive.	49.3221076578879
So, whatever has been stated in this regard, vintage cars and motorcycles are not included under the directive.	56.36328171430531
We do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive.	51.26446850519626
Amendment No 23 involves the Commission' s having to adopt quality standards for reusable components.	59.538501768929486
This is not covered by the directive.	14.431555206087886
An ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the European Parliament and the Council.	28.80154548967986
Amendments Nos 29, 31 and 41 water down the requirements concerning the dismantling of vehicles.	96.99998714205748
There is a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic, tyres and glass.	31.93306905584067
Finally, the Commission cannot approve Amendments Nos 1 and 33 for reasons to do with legal clarity; nor Amendment No 19, which the Commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage.	53.927889355183275
Furthermore, Amendment No 43 does not fall within the directive' s area of applicability.	41.10453005414499
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	6.573406575229789
The debate is closed.	3.77548916318001
We shall now proceed to the vote.	14.539435159860203
Vote	281.09893356486054
Madam President, as you know, the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the numerous and serious translation errors, particularly in the French version.	52.57577581906461
You have received a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistakes in this report and in other reports with which I have had dealings recently.	50.923283896955475
There is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on Amendment No 4.	19.948558995849687
In the English version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations.	50.19605661026135
In the French version that becomes 'entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisations scientifiques' .	39.29772614916624
Could you please make sure that French-speaking Members of this House know that the word entreprises is not correct.	54.001715665462754
It should not be in the amendment.	34.30946869968298
And, again, I urge you, Madam President, to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently.	67.86802833361811
Madame McNally, in general, I am myself rather concerned at the increasing number of problems we are having with the translations.	110.87633800771594
I shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution.	41.67587953508517

Madam President, we simply have a few translation problems in this area too.	36.39198036163902
We consider the English version to be the original text.	57.816976742172095
To give you an example, in both paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Dutch and German versions, the equivalents of the English words: "in so far as" have been omitted.	64.87528632172645
This is why I would ask you to consider the English version as the original version.	25.244465392419837
Thank you, Mr van Velzen.	17.738259115969417
In response I shall say the same thing I said to Mrs McNally just now.	56.47953309481842
I am very concerned about these translation problems which, unfortunately, we seem to be having increasingly, and I can assure you that we shall look into the matter very seriously indeed.	49.84201481156836
In any case, the authoritative version is always, of course, the original language version.	64.91848588458821
Madam President, the Socialist Group proposes the following oral amendment.	32.12588048923706
I shall read it in English, which is the original language of the resolution.	42.136801230563094

McNally Report (A5-0082/1999)	25.719080604110083
- (FR) I am pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the Commission entitled 'Women and Science' .	25.45377571041907
In this document, the Commission proposes to stimulate debate with a view to promoting the increased participation of women in research in Europe.	35.55946378084023
This objective deserves our total support.	128.46703821263876
Expenditure on research and technology actually forms a sizeable part of the budget of the European Union, after agriculture and the Structural Funds.	49.71868866012001
The various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various Member States.	106.45417339606222
Relatively few women, however, are active in scientific disciplines despite the excellent results they achieve in their studies.	152.37415680574486
It is unacceptable for women to continue to be underrepresented.	17.46827487842268
I am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the European Commission.	12.265218731757727
The Commission document sets out to focus on the initiatives to be taken at Community level, especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, which is quite obviously something I approve of.	50.492855258238194
The goal for the years to come is to increase women' s participation to achieve a rate of 40% female participation in the Marie Curie grants, in consultative assemblies and in evaluation panels for the whole of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.	54.611950023016625
In order to do so, it will be necessary to improve discussion and the sharing of experience among the various Member States, to set up a coordinating body to implement a 'Women and Science' monitoring system within the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, specially responsible for gathering and disseminating statistics collected in the implementation of the framework programme for research and technical development regarding the rate of women' s participation in research activities.	43.026379406980695
Furthermore, like the rapporteur, I think that studies must be undertaken to analyse the reasons for the gap between the number of women with science degrees and the number of women who manage to have a career in these fields.	45.352401891173606
Improved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles.	76.37301776637001
We will have to enlist the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in framing a joint research policy.	54.4698861208655
The European Parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development as regards the promotion of women and to come up with ideas for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.	28.577355577446696
We must incorporate the gender factor in science, research and all other European Union policies, in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevents women competing on equal terms in the labour market.	46.02322437388065
In its communication "Women and Science" , the European Commission informs us of its good intentions of enlisting the support of women to enrich research in Europe.	61.497242022469415
This is very good, and we are pleased to see it.	18.919609016406827
The fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the European Union.	33.98955223647623
We know that we can change this situation, in which women are underrepresented in the science sector, only by means of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a greater range of career choices for girls and, when they have obtained their degrees, by means of positive measures at the professional level.	48.130882406061545
Having said this, some of our fellow Members clearly have qualms because the report by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities which we have voted on contains one point which may lead to confusion and is interpreted by some as a quota stipulating that there must be 40% female participating in research in Europe.	49.20738812986847
This is patently not the case, since such a quota would not be realistic.	33.58528934006107
Indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved.	35.061432126432486
To set my fellow Members' minds at ease and to reassure them, I have tabled an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the Commission, in its communication, undertakes to make significant efforts to increase women' s participation in Community research programmes, which is, after all, a praiseworthy goal.	48.74884752744065
And why should we not note that the Commission' s communication stipulates specifically that it considers a 40% minimum level to be a crucial goal for women' s participation at all levels in the implementation and management of research programmes?	53.46413518916668
It is not a quota!	17.894921444773143
It is a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the Commission, insofar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of Member States.	56.948190412572345
The latter would be well advised, however, to follow the good example of the Commission, for once, and make the same efforts in their own research programmes.	57.35645615304512
People must realise this!	112.98934151228524
I am pleased to see that the debate on Mrs McNally' s report with a view to increasing and facilitating women' s participation in professions in research and science, met with a fairly wide consensus.	33.902176750403996
On this subject, any improvement in bringing the concept of equal opportunities to bear in everyday reality is indeed desirable, and I can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contribute towards satisfying the legitimate aspirations of women: to enjoy equal access to scientific study, to obtain positions of responsibility truly in line with their results and competence, and to have accompanying measures drawn up rapidly, enabling them to reconcile their family life and their career.	94.2746822978236
This necessary realistic and pragmatic policy, however, which will have to be associated with the elimination of the practical obstacles identified as unquestionable factors in this inequality must, as far as we are concerned, necessarily be based on the idea of complementarity, which is the only one capable of justifying a proactive policy on the subject.	68.30726907758586
Our thinking and our future actions must focus on respecting these values, which truly respect gender differences, not on some postulated sexual equality, which has its own intrinsic contradictions. In any event there are no grounds for resorting to the easy option of a quantitative policy, based on the use of quotas, contrary to the idea of citizenship which the Members of Parliament in the UEN Group set great store by, and whose probable consequences would be the opposite of the effect apparently sought by Mrs McNally' s report, namely women' s participation in careers in science and research in proportion with their merit.	88.87888913383243
By having the opportunity to show their true merit, by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women, and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege, women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish. In this way they will succeed in altering balances which are still not in their favour.	69.51531636870038
Since the European Parliament chose to vote on a text that expressly resorted to the quota policy which my report for an opinion had attempted to denounce in no uncertain terms, and in spite of the general approach which I approve for the most part, I can do no other than abstain from the vote on Mrs McNally' s report.	72.00075858156866
Second reading of the Florenz report (A5-0006/2000)	29.58571577977384
Madam President, today in the second reading we have voted on the amendments to the Directive on end-of-life vehicles.	32.30393245225525
I have rejected the entire directive, not least because Amendment No 34 to Article 12 and the amendments to Article 5/4 have not received an adequate majority here in the House.	97.42120186094995
I come from a country which manufactures 50% of the cars in the EU and it is precisely the free collection of end-of-life cars which is so financially onerous and unacceptable.	55.9952110717054
Here, in my opinion, the labour market is also considerably burdened by the costs arising to these companies.	46.5689291039978
This cannot be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever mindful of employment.	28.73785070089276
I consider that this is a serious defect and that, in principle, it does not befit our legal system.	26.372528813788353
In my opinion, this directive is unacceptable for this reason.	18.5104014600597
Madam President, I would like to comment on the Florenz report.	12.762408585094104
I think that the vote has shown that although the common position of the Council has been toned down, the major groups here (and above all the German delegates of the major groups) have not, thank God, succeeded in destroying the heart of the directive, namely manufacturer responsibility.	57.09490753584877
Unfortunately, there has been a toning down of the effective ecological material flow policy, i.e. through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years.	103.81877069040736
We know that lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made.	89.85588348576505
Here, unfortunately, the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry.	30.79409234286821
I am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-of-life vehicles.	100.2021509817368
I found this to be an extremely shameful attempt and I am pleased that it failed, that the attempt by one large government and the delegates of a large Member State did not gain a majority, by which I mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the European Parliament on grounds of the interests of its national industries.	64.41362408140078
Madam President, although I too have spent most of my life in fast cars, I agree with my colleague, Mr Florenz, that the directive on scrapping cars must make it clear that vintage cars are not included.	71.3040402623269
These splendid cars do not constitute waste.	96.3331907767111
That is why I voted in favour of the amendments.	10.301929219621908
Neither can we fix what the age for a vintage car should be as there are very great differences from one country' s statutes to another' s.	115.07773458646949
In this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations.	74.14171268823247
We cannot forget old car enthusiasts either, of whom there are more than 50 000 in Finland alone.	104.82254644333081
They are involved in low-profile work of valuable cultural importance.	223.40570634306047
- (SV) The parliamentary process concerning this question has been confusing, to say the least.	113.80013005737739
Before the vote at the plenary sitting, new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the Committee.	60.174263213586855
In the divided situation which has now arisen, we therefore consider that the Council' s wordings are the best.	54.0952305063842
We need a directive in this area, and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure.	38.92451248577977
The directive concerning end-of-life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation.	90.39190185716333
It is therefore important that the manufacturer' s liability should be clear. This should not in any way be jeopardised.	24.68800907461782
Today, Parliament is examining, for the last time, this text on 'end-of-life' vehicles and what is to be done with them: their destruction, a commendable intention with regard to our environment.	74.05313435978863
There are, however, two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text.	54.74335453487378
First of all, who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction?	57.15039174880669
We must all ensure that it is not always the same person, i.e. the vehicle owner, who pays.	59.81429609810741
He or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle, which is a bottomless pit in financial terms.	139.74939839916883
We have recently had cause to talk about the 'polluter pays' principle. We should apply this principle rationally and calmly, correctly targeted and without ideology.	81.85201720102083
Another essential point that must be included in this text is the express exclusion of vintage vehicles from its scope.	158.06923036751098
One might make the claim that there is no need to state it explicitly in writing because it is an obvious point, but I feel that it is a point that should be made in writing because there is every interest in adopting clear texts.	50.24865813742164
So let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these gems of the automobile industry.	27.763259365019465
These old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by Europe, if we are not to water down each of our specific identities.	57.343439178132655
There is no lack of examples amongst European texts, and we all know how much debate and argument is caused by a lack of clarity and precision.	73.03946338345057
I only need to mention the case of Directives 79/409 and 92/43.	91.52451022380131
The precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis.	98.79492019034008
It is not the job of the MEP to generate litigation or legal proceedings for judges in any arena. That would not be fulfilling our mission.	70.055253571701
On the contrary, we must adopt crystal-clear texts in order to limit legal disputes.	70.26079451074496
.	785.4324778346265
(NL) That the Florenz report has caused such a stir has been proven by the powerful lobby machine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement.	88.2000546028323
I regret that the manufacturers have harangued the European Parliament and the Council with a whole ream of arguments which either cut no ice or were simply false.	70.24052814483132
I dare say this because I took the trouble to go into the field and collect information from, among others, scrapyards which already recycle car components successfully.	200.76670729771246
They made it clear to me that the arguments concerning lack of safety, for example, are nonsense.	62.47819402413272
The car lobby was unsuccessful today and I am pleased about that.	33.41355572090947
The directive remains in place.	54.547770640659124
I expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the efforts to achieve a better living environment will triumph over unreasonable industrial requirements.	108.59112099739747
- My party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments.	125.87411569421174
There are few things more certain in life than taxes, death and pollution.	214.78509415358704
However, there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives.	131.63331516491604
When it comes to pollution, like sin, we are all against it, but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good.	83.97411642709407
In fact, this directive, like so many others addressing environmental issues, is not good.	85.91157725646612
As is so often the case, it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem, which will only serve to create more jobs for officials, and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money.	104.93436867122958
The one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut.	42.51312455921513
No one, not least my party, could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged, but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market, not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity.	115.01865117191124
Thus, a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles, to encourage private sector recycling companies, through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements, and to incentivise the use of recycled materials.	138.7016032427373
Of course, these are areas where the EU does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction.	73.69492306844063
However, in the absence of these powers, it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure.	71.87377127420692
Instead, it should leave Member States to develop their own systems, and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good.	75.48976021167275
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000)	10.703414383465507
This proposal for a directive attempts to establish conditions for the posting of workers who are third-country nationals, for the provision of cross-border services.	27.58861197787839
Third-country nationals with a permanent right of residence in one Member State do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the European Union.	40.9830614470067
Until now, the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the Union of non-Community workers have been very harsh.	72.7502690420687
It is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the European Union is being made easier, even when they are nationals of third countries.	36.21590117917347
Nevertheless, the proposal for a directive merely aims to allow them to move to another Member State when they are posted there by an employer based in their country of normal residence. This means that their scope for movement is limited to the duration of their posting and only to the Member State to which they were posted.	81.21848646781457
This means that this proposal' s fundamental aim is not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these workers, but merely to improve the position of the companies providing services.	65.80667815644732
On the other hand, for the sake of simplifying procedures some highly debatable amendments have been included in the Berger report, one example of which is the establishment of a common information service for cards issued by a body in any Member State.	56.85363377909027
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger Report (A5-0012/2000)	13.931951026842874
It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives intended to facilitate the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of a third country while facilitating the freedom of movement of services.	48.375478093108974
Basically, these proposals introduce the EU service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country nationals legally resident in a European Union Member State to provide services in other Member States, a phenomenon currently obstructed by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits.	87.51108912479829
The first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there.	66.28113744002985
According to the terms of the directive, the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned.	55.367711620131566
Logically, in order to be given such a card, the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be covered by a social security scheme.	52.902182007910284
The second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed workers who are third country nationals.	100.3525800077135
While, basically, I subscribe to the European Commission proposals, nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion.	76.23839183819072
That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur.	8.602350456194472
This will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading!	44.022258758848984
Other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures, for example by authorising Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards.	93.47660055158643
I feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions.	55.38268322769654
I can, therefore, only be delighted at the adoption of these directives thus amended. We could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the European Union had to face so many problems.	85.35229663636954
This goes against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this Union.	60.1806047724725
Marinho Report (A5-0003/2000):	41.05307265046536
We have serious reservations about the Council' s proposed amendments.	22.04255495687688
How can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the Court of First Instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that Court because it is overstretched?	36.94454170394608
The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter.	38.78825647826724
Some people will say that perfection is not a realistic aim, but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them:	98.49120460333292
On 1 January 1995, the Council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in Article 17 of the Accession Treaty of 24 June 1994.	51.656884099087755
In May 1995, during the preparatory phase of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the CFI, concerned about the persistent increase in the volume of cases, was already insisting on the need to take measures 'without which the Court would soon cease to be able to fully satisfy the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulfil its assigned role ... in conditions likely to compromise the protection of parties subject to trial.'	73.41829062861953
So what was done at Amsterdam?	84.22037459801636
In that respect, nothing. On the contrary, extending the Community' s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden.	65.55196640516404
You will agree, furthermore, that the texts adopted by this House always call for Community jurisdiction, and that includes for the Charter of Fundamental Rights which is currently being drawn up.	42.98661615031058
The increase in the number of CFI judges from 15 to 21 and the opportunity it has recently been accorded to have a single judge rule on specific cases are not real solutions but mere decoys, grudgingly granted, which we have become aware of after the fact.	111.73156598271085
Consequently, these proposals do not live up to the issues at stake. They represent a downward spiral which in the long term would require the number of judges to be increased to several hundred.	51.12133658698651
We cannot agree to this, since such a sidelong shift towards a Europe of the Judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our States.	62.536762590401416
The time has come, we feel, for in-depth consideration of how to put the Community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice.	80.60000492625133
This question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity.	38.649371949331396
Is the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference not the ideal opportunity for this?	80.4449231145143
Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen Report (A5-0018/2000)	33.57970066993621
- (SV) The most important task of the approaching Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	40.307872327266594
We therefore, of course, support the European Parliament' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference.	43.785964721494494
We nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place.	28.830476204164004
We also argued this in November 1999, and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of 18 November 1999.	49.659644113961065
.	785.4324778346265
(FR) In the opinion which it has just adopted on the convening of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament calls for a "constitutional process to be launched" .	36.256791541227244
This determination to override nations with a legally supranational text is also expressed in the first meetings of the body responsible for drawing up the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is really a closet constitution.	66.8509513265406
It is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the European Parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in Austria.	51.42332423231303
The same determination to reduce nations to the level of mere administrative regions is also evident on every page of the opinion issued by the Commission for the Intergovernmental Conference.	76.1189195504293
The key idea involves making qualified majority voting the general rule while modifying the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority, of States and peoples, in order to increase the Commission' s room for manoeuvre and reduce that of the minority States.	92.34365394467699
Incidentally, the French will probably be interested to learn that the Commission is asking for Article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament.	48.64233803502552
People will remember that this article, dealing with the transfer of immigration policy to the Community level, stipulated that for five years decisions would still be taken by unanimous vote in the Council and thereafter the Council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system.	95.69237602388772
In France, both in the National Assembly and in the Senate, when this was being ratified, many members of the French parliament were reassured to hear that, in any case, the Council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision-making.	58.977868642300514
Well, today, the same Minister of European Affairs who drew up the Treaty of Amsterdam, who has, in the meantime, become a European Commissioner, Mr Barnier, proposes to decide, at the forthcoming IGC, that the Council will operate in these areas by majority decision.	119.07104197819915
This is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of European integration with the Brussels institutions.	93.58131683923584
The French must be made aware not only that the purpose of all these operations is to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision making, but that furthermore every means will be used to extract their consent.	71.9021198775608
If they yield, they are lost.	105.12182292261924
For it is their very means of defence which are being eliminated one by one.	181.07730954574637
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the report on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	28.40632234590238
It is crucial for us that it should be possible for this Intergovernmental Conference to be concluded before the end of the year 2000 so that there are no remaining formalities, such as the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers and the composition of the Commission and the European Parliament, which place obstacles in the way of the enlargement of the EU.	21.54653439761092
We were therefore also very satisfied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the Helsinki Summit in December.	27.0934135806921
An unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process.	117.9996172982913
That is something we do not want to see, and we have therefore voted against any such extension.	32.46753228627245
We nonetheless very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceeding.	32.4731836079796
.	785.4324778346265
(SV) We are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Conference.	36.41572707628901
Possible future Member States ought to be involved in, and have an influence upon, the shaping of the EU of the future.	63.686015165852446
The elections to the European Parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist EU centred upon Brussels.	68.73610982854895
With the convening of the forthcoming IGC, the process of European Union is topical once again.	46.2375266156773
Once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the Heads of State and Government.	21.845315845240787
In other words, fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide, behind closed doors, on the fate of more than 350 million individuals.	57.45793111117101
It is therefore easy to understand the public' s lack of interest, given the construction of Europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them.	49.617429565317124
In fact, one only need look at the agenda of the IGC: the institutions, enlargement and European defence.	113.68964768870886
The fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power, the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe, particularly by increasing military budgets.	43.78472245200557
Social Europe, used as a foil by the EU, has simply been eliminated from the agenda.	68.67838289174848
All this does is to legitimise the development, on the European scale, of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers' main claims towards the highest common denominator.	142.78315431403084
This is why I am voting against the report.	11.546177031001772
I voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of convening the IGC. I did so because it sums up the philosophy of the Portuguese Presidency, which is supported by a broad majority in Parliament, of opening up the IGC agenda beyond issues strictly related to redressing the balance of power between Member States, large and small, as was originally stated when the Helsinki Council was convened.	101.13073341919431
Unfortunately, in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for revisions to the Treaty on European Union, nothing has so far been stated about the need to review Article 7, which deals with suspending a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the "founding" principles of the Union, as laid down in Article 6.	48.8199251918891
As the present crisis involving Austria has demonstrated, the Union has the right to protect itself.	77.25286831734473
Nevertheless, the legal mechanisms that exist in the Treaty are weak, difficult to apply politically and legally, do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance. Suspending a state is just such a process, and is to be condemned.	117.86960059551103
I therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda, and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the Treaties.	27.53948792324491
We feel that at present the central issues about convening an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties are far more important than the controversy taking place here about the size of the agenda. They are also more important than the controversy over the appropriateness or otherwise of formulating proposals for new issues to be covered, and more important than the controversy over the extent of Parliament' s participation in it.	78.39193395357955
We feel that these issues result from the IGC' s appropriateness and its objectives, as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there.	71.69605069531515
We have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the IGC because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged.	95.21777617223586
This relates in particular to the intended agenda, particularly as regards the Amsterdam leftovers, which suggests that unacceptable inner cabinets will be created in the future. This also identifies areas relating to the second and third pillars, which tend to be reflected in an undesirable militarisation of the European Union.	56.966142705388414
These are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us.	24.377858446717955
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report.	63.75380190831995
The text is overambitious, and Britain' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the "Amsterdam left-overs" in order to prepare for enlargement, and not expand far beyond these.	123.81694985290505
There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions.	37.61232291126784
Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation.	130.1956842115227
The key factor in this text as it has been amended, is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties.	29.126129010113694
In our view, this would bring with it a complex legislative burden, and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are.	86.6904883032721
Our priorities (i.e. the "left-overs" ) must be:	136.66633682894212
the number and responsibilities of Commissioners	119.70117358485696
weighting of votes in the Council	62.59037182969235
extension of QMV in areas where it will benefit the UK and Europe (but not Treaty change, defence matters, border controls or taxation), and extension of codecision wherever QMV is extended	311.0008622907485
Beyond this, we have concerns that the "flexibility" or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present.	238.15696057891273
The provisions of Amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation.	103.52438867032829
- (SV) In order to be able to influence developments, the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference than emerges from the present resolution, which displays far too much disappointment and negativity about the decision which the European Council made in Helsinki in December 1999.	54.51878974688245
The European Parliament and its Committee on Constitutional Affairs ought instead to have been more specific and concentrated on just a few points in addition to the Council decision in Helsinki, so stating what it considered to be the most pressing matters for discussion, including the question of establishing a public prosecutor to deal with crimes against the institutions of the European Union and their financial interests.	46.81909184844516
We Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the EU to the east if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in 1997.	66.62948680784336
The most important task of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	25.35629395208361
I therefore, of course, support the European Parliament' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference.	41.690329425533605
I nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for the enlargement to take place.	28.404351589120274
I also refer to my explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 which clarifies my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence.	63.16305315308248
Joint resolution on Austria	470.30294745967456
Madam President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group did not associate itself with the joint PPE/DE-PSE resolution on the political situation in Austria following the formation in that country of a coalition government between the conservatives and Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party.	65.18441095376227
This PPE/DE-PSE resolution commends the initiative taken by fourteen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott.	70.5946043737806
What we find most shocking is the fact that this joint intervention claims the authority of the Treaty, as if this stated somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancelled by the will of the heads of government of neighbouring countries who in fact, in this instance, have carefully refrained from consulting their own peoples.	79.85091115273708
Whatever Jörg Haider' s verbal excesses, which we of course deplore, the Austrians have made a democratic choice, and we must respect this.	109.63497398255487
In our opinion, it is clear that the left wing in the European Parliament, in association with the Austrian left wing which was defeated in the electoral arena, have mounted a petty political campaign resorting to the memory of a sinister but fortunately bygone period.	44.63476035564534
Although comparing Haider to Hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever, it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in unsettling some PPE/DE Members of Parliament.	168.30081199493674
But, going beyond this petty political operation, what the majority in the European Parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in Austria, which caused political life to stagnate and rot, may soon spread to the European system of co-management which is producing equally appalling results.	109.92969471389596
In order to prevent this threat to the system, it is ready to do anything, including overruling the outcome of free elections, including setting up a thought police, including establishing a new form of totalitarianism.	70.66098362131355
Madam President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament who represent the Front national, the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento sociale italiano, I should like to ask the question: in this outrageous interference in internal Austrian affairs which the European Union has undertaken in contravention of general international law, in contravention of the Treaties, in contravention of morality, who is pulling the strings?	42.20992053796811
Is this hysteria spontaneous?	37.61119302618948
Is it the product of mere foolishness or, more probably, of a deliberate strategy, which is the same throughout the world?	51.76663721201254
Who is imposing their will on the nations of Europe, daring to stop them choosing their own fate?	139.69429988092054
Underground networks?	300.2994374746145
The government of the United States, or of Israel?	44.54610690954859
Or their Socialist back-up troops who, in this House, have the cheek to thrust their values down our throats?	307.1531306970487
What, then, are the values of these Socialists who feathered their electoral nest in the last century by painting the idea of greater social justice in glowing colours for the benefit of the underprivileged, and who today are nothing more than the party of protected civil servants, full-time union officials and state capitalism?	95.72897802604994
What are the values of the Belgian Socialist Party, which only goes from paedophilia scandals to corruption scandals, via Vandam and Agusta?	88.1106445779484
What are the values of the French Socialist Party, which extorted money from all the town councils under its thumb in the Urba, Sages and Graco scandals?	43.956562610617105
The party led by François Mitterrand, decorated with the emblem of Marshal Pétain' s Vichy government, the party whose leading lights have just been caught red-handed once again, living a life of luxury on the public funds embezzled from the students' mutual insurance company.	103.28894240099977
I shall not even mention the instances of corruption in the Italian Socialist Party, because it does not do to kick a man when he is down, still less when he is dead and gone.	105.1486437489254
I shall, however, mention the Spanish Socialist Party which has just formed an alliance with the butchers of Albacete and which settled its accounts with Basque nationalists by hiring contract killers.	71.1007022536121
I shall also mention the German Socialist Party which dares to preach to us about the second world war, when it is international socialist in the way that its peers were National Socialists, still goose-stepping, the party of the Waffen SS...	61.71006303815513
(The President cut the speaker off)	8.491221292876252
Madam President, I had a major problem with this resolution.	23.35350455300009
Finally, I abstained on the vote for a number of reasons.	31.159497691391696
I was in sympathy with the EDD Group amendment, talking about rejecting the interference of the EU in the formation of governments of Members States but I had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia, racism, etc. and I felt that it might be misinterpreted.	77.5509008136315
However, I do wonder about the wisdom of this.	27.198513915490903
Firstly, there is the question of trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long-term consequences of that.	37.67035133210385
I also wonder about the wisdom of the EU and its reaction to the formation of the government in Austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there.	35.754917524208835
At the moment it seems that the Haider Party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments.	135.95318523736387
Even America has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations.	92.0611316894164
We wonder if this is actually feeding the flames of xenophobia and the parties and people that support it.	53.380364898185896
I really think that people should be extremely cautious.	38.44268732906032
If you want to combat xenophobia and racism, and I believe that we should, we need to look at the root causes.	32.32612912661265
We need to look at the people who vote for these parties, and understand why this situation arises.	53.05248820051053
It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want, but we need to be careful about the approach we take, so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve.	35.97992278470406
Madam President, I strongly refute any statement, demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism.	153.23773333270873
I passionately defend Europe' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law.	44.93735818962133
I disagree, however, for this very reason, with the senseless actions taken by the Presidency - the Portuguese Presidency unfortunately - which have resulted in a real institutional blunder on behalf of the other fourteen States.	63.577906348922255
This is not the way to fight extremism.	25.540894324771052
It may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good.	72.55501850521607
The torrent of confusion and rash actions that has been unleashed over Austria has blown things out of all proportion. It has caused considerable distress to decent citizens and evokes risks that had previously not even been considered.	89.5964368380635
There is an irreconcilable contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law, but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the Austrians and ride roughshod over the basic tenets of the rule of law, in this case the standards laid down in the Treaties.	31.102146627950802
What are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an Intergovernmental Conference?	37.62685302919781
A Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14, or even fewer?	136.51555709999866
We support Europe, a Europe which does honour to all the actions that have brought us to this point, a Europe which respects the Treaties and the law and a Europe which needs Austria.	69.03439340193256
This needs to be said!	32.26727701830614
Madam President, I am delighted and proud that this Parliament has, by an enormous majority, condemned the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporating Mr Haider' s Freedom Party.	46.388159294333704
Mr Haider has demonstrated, over the past years by both words and deeds, that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse.	70.01454477248805
Not only has he admired Adolf Hitler, praised the Waffen SS, and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four Roma, but also in Carinthia has been a member of the regional government.	93.89209580138578
He has led efforts to end provision for Austria' s Slovene-speaking minority and assistance to immigrants.	167.96120727640786
Some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics.	44.64127358557277
They are wrong.	78.6290579690988
European Union Treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights.	79.87467403793177
Some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections.	55.64278221615316
However, democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy.	166.70435342699295
There is the tragic monument of the Holocaust, the death of 6 million Jews, to those who argued the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930s.	70.15948766695205
However, we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition.	72.1060650485787
Leopards do not change their spots.	46.60202749636391
The real culprits are Austria' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945.	104.51151298025644
Madam President, we have just passed a resolution which condemns the racist and xenophobic record of Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party in Austria, which has welcomed action by our governments to cut off political relations with any government of which he is part, and which sends our support to anti-racist groups within the democratic majority of the Austrian people.	85.93956147666505
We warn that this coalition, if it is formed today, unacceptably legitimises the extreme right, directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation, which bring us together in this European Union.	77.88168015706734
These are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us.	50.95195700188671
This European Parliament requires the European Commission to be vigilant of any racist action in Austria, and threatens to suspend Austria from membership of the European Union if this happens.	64.07444585162733
I am proud to support such a resolution.	42.36195320921609
Though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament has not carried today, I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-Nazis to government in Europe can and will be taken.	117.22680530350615
I shall take the floor very briefly, Madam President.	33.17471206568473
I respect Parliament' s wish, as it has been expressed, but I must also say that the self-determination of peoples cannot be called into question, even by the European Parliament.	46.32079877397195
The document is unfair both to Austrian Members of the European Parliament, and to members of the Austrian national parliament, and it smacks slightly of jealousy and political interests, but also of business.	60.63751200480222
I do not believe that these signals will change the citizens' indifference to Europe.	30.011734042575238
The Austrian extreme right has been gifted an unwarranted present.	64.28560927263304
I very much welcome the position taken by the Italian Radicals; and I say this while making a clear historic and material distinction between Italian liberals and Austrian liberals.	51.79494544898431
I have for many years, in word and deed, been committed to the anti-fascist struggle and the struggles for equal rights and against xenophobia. However, recent events - firstly, what were really threats by the Council of Ministers, then Mr Prodi' s threats against the Austrian Commissioner and, finally, the present decision - are things I cannot support.	133.51994530987164
I have not been able to vote in favour of the present decision even though I agree with many of its premises. What we have here, first and foremost, is an incredibly ominous mixture of power, arrogance and impotence on the part of the European Union.	20.31679545919869
Not only do these decisions conflict with the Treaty and apportion to the institutions of the Union more power than that to which they are entitled but, worst of all, their effect will be counter-productive.	102.87026466291331
They will not weaken Mr Haider and the FPÖ. On the contrary, they will strengthen them.	62.273116016458516
We shall obtain the very opposite of what we want.	57.24844465965372
That is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right.	64.8089647831901
. (DA) The Left' s Members of the European Parliament attach importance to the fact that, with today' s decision, Parliament has NOT supported the fourteen prime ministers' diplomatic sanctions against Austria.	85.73879349531195
The Left' s Members of Parliament therefore supported the Liberal decision' s powerful rejection of any form of xenophobia in Austria or elsewhere.	115.48043965191077
We attach crucial importance to applying, if necessary, the new provisions under Article 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty so that a country which, by its actions, infringes fundamental citizens' rights by means of discrimination and such like will have its voting rights in the EU' s Council of Ministers removed.	118.85542616736309
- (EL) The Freedom Party' s participation in the Austrian Government is a dangerous development for the European Union' s political future.	56.264544853029776
It is a 'Trojan horse' which is unfortunately reappearing in Europe larger than ever since the Second World War.	37.51136827601
The European Parliament and the Union' s governments must politically isolate a government that includes admirers of Nazism and advocates of xenophobia.	95.16684721183107
The European Union bears a large measure of responsibility - and along with it the two dominant political movements, the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats - because, by their dogmatic adherence to the harsh financial policies of EMU, their dislocation of the welfare state and their deification of uncontrolled competition, they have pushed broad strata of society to the limits and made it possible for right-wing extremists of the Haider type to recruit support for their neo-Nazi ways.	87.20808152849935
	785.4324778346265
In view of the fact that the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament do not permit us to table our own resolution condemning Haider' s party, as well as all the parties throughout Europe which disseminate racist slander and which are xenophobic and hostile to immigrant workers, we voted in favour of the compromise resolution. We did so even though we did not agree with some of its recitals or terms, in order to show our solidarity with all those in Austria itself who are opposing the Austrian extreme right and its demagoguery.	53.16468679622351
Our vote in no way constitutes an endorsement of the signatories to this compromise resolution, their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious.	119.61701318281393
Some of these parties, despite declaring themselves to be republican and democratic, adopt the demagoguery of the extreme right, either out of connivance or as a vote-winning ploy, if only in openly and hypocritically blaming the immigrant workers in our countries for unemployment, and generally making their lives more difficult.	107.21709552207855
More generally, those signatories who take part in or have taken part in government in the various States of the European Union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right has managed to gain since their policy, devoted exclusively to the interests of big business, has not included taking action likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it engenders, and has thus facilitated the xenophobic demagoguery of the extreme right.	90.16753202488444
This week we heard the first political cry of the new-born Europe.	82.91129815594208
By staunchly and speedily denouncing the participation of Jörg Haider' s xenophobic and anti-European party in the Austrian government, a situation without precedent since the second world war, the European Union has come into its political birthright and has confirmed that it is not merely an economic and financial Community, a large market, a "Europe of shopkeepers" .	54.08954309255902
It is a part of its future which is at stake right now, part of its very essence, its heart and soul.	88.08522951430817
The European Parliament was the first to speak up.	36.21026326102496
The appeal by the European Socialists, on the initiative of Olivier Duhamel, raised awareness and enabled there to be a firm and immediate political response to this unheard of and intolerable situation.	77.64166374294086
A firm attitude which the 14 European States have demonstrated unanimously and promptly, through Mr Guterres, by condemning the risk of the Austrian political situation getting out of control.	108.24154661554729
This courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of Europe.	60.993823790469975
A return to the roots, at last, for a Community built on the basis of the determination to turn our backs on a past history marred by hatred and exclusion and of adherence to the humanist values of openness and tolerance.	79.24877635724627
Europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events.	137.9697389378026
However, as it lacks the legal instruments to support this political will, since the sanctions stipulated under Article 7 of the Treaties are virtually impossible to apply, will it be able to keep its head high in the face of the threat of the systematic blocking of its entire institutional structure?	104.35380473224065
The whole credibility of Europe is at stake today, before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracies of the former eastern bloc to join us tomorrow.	89.78221750533423
From now on Europe must put its words into action if it wishes to show the world the scope of its rediscovered ambition.	105.4756549362321
At this time when we are voting on a joint resolution against the inclusion of neo-Nazis in the government of a European Union Member State, I must express my regrets regarding a compromise text which is particularly lacking in backbone.	51.706627568372255
I am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the European Parliament, after its excellent political debate yesterday, should not adopt a stance on this matter.	30.877388338011635
Personally, however, I shall continue to fight against the extreme right, to urge people to sign a petition to demand measures which may go as far as the exclusion of Austria, and to organise a major public demonstration in Lille on Saturday at 3 p.m.	61.448641762522136
Fascism and neo-Nazism are cancers!	102.55045088957337
The foul monster has been reawakened!	13.452907341768514
For me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might.	76.66257451071172
Europe was born out of a desire for peace, freedom and tolerance.	95.59281825663737
There is no question of it allowing xenophobic, racist and anti-Semitic ministers to be tolerated at within it.	102.35015729474196
Do not count on me to keep quiet, without doing or saying anything.	138.03929554201372
In yesterday' s debate in the European Parliament some Members of this Parliament expressed worry that we were interfering in the internal affairs of a Member State.	31.381939657489255
Such a concern is misplaced.	42.91710350628716
The European Parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in Member States with which they disagree.	34.7509795414671
We have condemned Basque and Irish terrorism.	138.20401522812935
We have opposed racism and the infringement of the rights of minorities.	61.249863701792776
It is our responsibility as a parliament, particularly as the democratically elected voice of the European Union, to comment on current political developments in Austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament.	43.208396575511365
By commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in Austria from forming a coalition government.	148.01286480372966
We are nonetheless, as is our right as well as our responsibility, telling them that if they go ahead then there are consequences arising from such a decision and in fact we are warning them beforehand.	77.6574739301751
Others would argue that we should suspend judgement until we see the detail of such an agreement.	90.6876347661424
Such a view is not only a political cop-out, it is positively dangerous.	46.65215298312958
In reaching an agreement with Jörg Haider and his party, the Austrian Christian Democrats would at a stroke be confirming political respectability on right wing extremism and also giving them access to power - both of which they will utilise as a launching pad for even greater electoral success.	84.1325115260344
That is why the European Union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in Austria.	23.792318665382478
- (SV) We have voted in favour of the common resolution in order to express our solidarity with all those who are exposed to xenophobia and racism.	27.462066505323538
We have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the detestable politics that Jörg Haider stands for.	36.31226113464922
We are nonetheless very critical of the methods which the 14 Member States have employed on this issue.	51.71060960777514
The resolution makes no clear reference to respect for the Member States' national identities and constitutional traditions in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty.	33.899121548546944
What is also missing is a paragraph concerning the EU' s shared responsibility for the social and political developments in Europe and Austria which have been among the prior conditions for Mr Haider' s electoral success.	77.84915504452113
Today, as previously in the history of Europe, right-wing extremism is the result of insecure social and economic conditions of life.	57.4025588985684
The policy of cut-backs which has followed in the wake of adjusting to EMU has promoted the successes of right-wing extremism.	77.2505476187966
A radical policy to promote security and justice in each country is the best guarantee of democratic development in Europe.	50.42548500782983
- (DE) I am making this statement on behalf of the CSU.	26.323530321690534
It is intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State.	23.36073838739723
It has no right to do so.	15.785241215641001
Instead of prematurely condemning the FPÖ and the Austrian Government which is being formed, there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition.	85.30595289460985
Only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe.	84.92638808133664
This does not mean that we sympathise with Haider.	25.173291881268664
The CSU European delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FPÖ.	58.55032755151382
However, as politicians we must ask the question why 27% of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FPÖ at the elections in October 1999.	84.3038269987259
We must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results.	53.66430298647987
Only by tackling the arguments and policies of the FPÖ can we prevent a radicalisation of Austrian politics.	136.54875993913564
However, the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem.	59.029524783698875
For these reasons the CSU European delegates are against this resolution.	62.16058795209023
"He knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books: that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good; that it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen-chests; that it bides its time in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, and bookshelves; and that perhaps the day would come when, for the bane and the enlightening of men, it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city."	60.68827769763264
It is with these phrases that Albert Camus, at the close of the long allegorical novel describing the difficult fight of the citizens of the town of Oran against the plague, reminds us, at the close of the Second World War, that the fight against Nazism, "the brown plague" as it was termed at the time, could not enjoy a definitive victory.	53.94823361546058
That because racial hatred, xenophobic violence, fear and rejection of what is different, have deep roots in all that is basest in humanity, they may re-emerge at any moment and take over any group of human beings.	176.33762381501688
In this light, the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic.	61.76116711723713
For the first time since the Second World War, a party which is openly pro-Nazi, racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a European country.	64.00698963843013
Confronted with this threat, which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of Europe, nothing must deter us: not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit, not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene, not the derisory respect for formal democracy, and, above all, not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control.	67.94240456700167
As the representative for a French overseas department, the island of Réunion, a land of racial and ethnic intermixing, where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, enlisted men from India or Pakistan, or even Chinese, every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exupéry, "In being different to me, you are not doing me harm, brother, but enriching me!"	108.58418266133972
This human diversity is our main sources of wealth, and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it, wherever it may exist.	66.53671537786667
For all these reasons I voted most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this House on the formation of the government in Austria.	31.611968383876633
Jörg Haider' s rise to power, with the inauguration of a conservative right-wing and FPÖ coalition government, is a sign of the terrible revival in Europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth.	90.11367509276924
The success of the Austrian Freedom Party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the Austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter, whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right-wing populism.	54.01125689238111
The resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of Fascism.	147.62575733968086
It can be explained by the feeling of helplessness of the people who are the victims of the ideology of mighty Mammon and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and deregulation ever further.	47.330677627065256
In order to oppose the xenophobic statements of an apprentice dictator who is nostalgic for the Third Reich, we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austrians opposed to Fascism.	54.852472047715054
This is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypocritical references to a 'European democratic model' which bears more resemblance to a fortress which tracks downs, expels and imprisons immigrants without the proper papers, when it is not opening files on teenagers.	39.97483235039173
- (DE) I have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Austria in view of a possible government being formed between the ÖVP and the FPÖ.	40.8569153614936
I consider the casting of Jörg Haider as "Europe's scapegoat" (or even worse, neo-Nazi and Super Racist) to be counterproductive.	70.84515758406222
Of course I, in no way, agree with the publicised statements of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the Hitler regime.	60.09867512466468
However, I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider's adherents.	80.61026721115068
The EU must not do him an invaluable PR service.	72.82273789825611
The strength of the FPÖ can be traced back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the Austrian socialists must bear the main responsibility.	57.40671954365173
It was only after they unsuccessfully solicited the FPÖ to tolerate a minority government and, obviously in vain, offered the Freedom Party ministerial posts, that the SPÖ begin its massive campaign against Haider.	160.33024169752974
It turned its threatened loss of power into an "heroic battle for the preservation of values" and an imminent, pure-and-simple "decision between democracy and non-democracy" .	130.1236267945212
This is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which I cannot condone.	32.09168413221935
We German Christian Democrats used another strategy in the battle against extremists and clearly disassociated ourselves from them.	143.94783120292965
We revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-minority.	57.316348188265046
Today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments.	79.26771078824655
The German approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again.	94.26713038348608
It cannot be copied arbitrarily since each Member State has its own specific conditions.	38.69521474470467
The ÖVP (Austrian People's Party), whose presence at European level we have also come to take for granted, is daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of governability in Austria.	69.05770339653589
It can only succeed if agreements are made which are solidly based on compliance with democratic principles.	72.76931636241811
The Council has become prematurely involved without waiting for the results of the coalition negotiations or a programme of government.	88.19647982488956
This condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the Austrian Republic.	183.5982521091363
Sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye.	250.69968597318334
We must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left.	41.60685956542207
I would have liked to see the same outrage in Europe when the socialists were prepared to make common cause with the successors to the misanthropic and persecutory regime in the DDR.	29.527185020726254
In the meantime, they have been forming governments in German federal states.	114.31958874907748
I fully support the statements made by Commissioner Prodi in today's session.	31.46349490677803
He spoke of the task of not isolating Member States but of doing everything to unite them in common European values.	81.48805365054207
- (FR) I voted against the joint resolution on the situation in Austria.	24.29306192487436
Austria is a free, independent and sovereign country.	69.62133649897736
Consequently, neither the Council, the Commission nor the European Parliament has the right to interfere in the internal administration of a Member State.	30.104359648168707
The Austrian elections were held in a free, proper and democratic manner.	69.30485075476808
Any interference by the European institutions in this country is therefore unacceptable; it is in violation of the European Treaty (Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam).	29.425143424057307
Nevertheless, these same institutions showed no reluctance to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union, despite its well-known human rights violations.	65.97074383745047
Nothing of this nature has yet occurred in Austria.	102.33873771204556
This precedent, created on the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency, is a worrying one as far as the future of the European Union is concerned.	28.83811391989148
On the one hand, the political excommunication of Austria only demonstrates the worrying influence of conformist thought. On the other hand, if tomorrow the governments of European Union Member States must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endorsement of supranational bodies, then the very principle of democracy will be destroyed.	59.00903698116909
In such circumstances will it even be worth having elections?	126.58086433031565
This is not the way to create the conditions for the nations of Europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future.	29.395209486877324
- (FR) The vote which has just taken place in this Chamber is a historic one for it is the first time we have ever debated the internal political situation of one of our Member States with such anxiety.	45.77836186262374
I believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is obliterated.	58.511058732581375
I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the Union.	18.91472446548572
I urge the Commission to be less cautious.	27.23441056181842
In this resolution, Parliament is assuming its responsibilities.	78.61469936302474
Having said that, in my opinion, the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum, the very least we could do.	53.71053686671137
Personally I argued in favour of a rather harder line, and I supported Amendments Nos 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8, as well as the oral amendment tabled by the Socialist Group.	32.42104301524717
In fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an Austrian Government which includes members of the Austrian Freedom Party.	43.82323875174237
Including Jörg Haider' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe, and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate countries.	81.33424940248992
The Austrian People' s Party must accept some historical responsibility for this.	40.50069837058153
It is our fundamental values which are at stake here. As the democratically elected representatives of the European people, we have no choice.	25.35360388663806
We must reject what is unacceptable, as our constituents demand.	57.40710277612903
Because, when the spectre of barbarism resurfaces, failure to oppose is tantamount to capitulation.	34.881535040787334
I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution.	51.23436135160132
I condemn Jörg Haider' s racist and xenophobic policy.	29.679312051760864
However, I cannot accept that an EU body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one Member State.	44.69609897927667
I cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution, and I cannot vote in favour of the resolution, even though it would be a vote against the extreme right.	27.975245990307435
- (SV) Obviously, the political leaders of Europe have a right and a duty to react against Mr Haider and his party.	60.279717397117665
The political leaders of Europe are entitled to express their view of political developments in another Member State, just as a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politicians in a local authority.	68.16745287088129
Finland' s experience, however, is that integration, rather than isolation, is the better way of combating antidemocratic forces.	82.1735132487611
I therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution, which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights.	45.98651308936865
The EU Presidency' s "common reaction" against the formation of the government in Austria is legally unjustified.	54.5272912928905
The treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 Member States.	41.05636148811945
Nor should we isolate the forces in Austria which wish to work for human rights.	54.91800502814354
Despite these objections of mine to the Council' s action and despite my view that it is better to work for integration than to employ isolating tactics, it was important to show clearly where the European Parliament stands on questions of racism, which is why I voted in favour of the resolution at the final vote.	56.14935178199249
That concludes the vote.	30.004450775095762
Adjournment of the session	49.31974409384982
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.	12.508029070915894
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)	6.263846179559207
Resumption of the session	34.0179758294628
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 3 February 2000.	11.380034347529113
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting	18.338388263646358
The Minutes of the sitting on Thursday 3 February have been distributed.	24.23396369919903
Are there any comments?	12.89232023557679
I can see from your reaction that many of the Members of Parliament have not received the Minutes and clearly you cannot approve Minutes which you have not seen.	65.46419133016823
I therefore propose to submit the Minutes for your approval tomorrow morning, since obviously you do not have them and I must apologise for this.	61.54819920611547
I shall therefore postpone the approval of the Minutes.	24.35363389047363
Madam President, on a point of order.	32.99230105435773
The BBC this morning reported that a British Member of this House, holding a senior position within his delegation, continues to offer strategic advice to private clients, but does not state in the Register of Interests who these clients are.	147.64349755406295
The people of Europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest separate from private profit, but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible.	69.64099251299724
Madam President, since these matters are currently being considered by the Quaestors, may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and, above all, to ensure that the Register is not only available for inspection by this House, but is also published on the Internet?	51.49734369806591
Thank you, Mr Davies.	14.221496226011018
I shall look into this matter with the College of Quaestors.	23.76520241454859
Madam President, on a point of order.	32.99230105435773
As this is the first Valentine' s Day of the new millennium I hope that you will agree with me that it would be fitting for this House to mark this day by making a firm commitment to tackling heart disease, the biggest killer in the European Union.	37.92945103111376
I would urge Members to sign up to the commitment made today at the Winning Hearts Conference that every child born in the new millennium has the right to live until the age of at least 65 without suffering from avoidable cardiovascular disease.	60.54892578118289
Happy Valentine' s Day!	118.62594549553624
Madam President, I rise under Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of this House and allude to the same point raised by Mr Davies about the very serious allegations made on BBC radio this morning.	54.86576075115411
I would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two Members who were named in this particular BBC interview are not running their companies from this Parliament or from parliamentary offices, because that would be a very serious matter indeed.	87.90895442325998
In the past the British Conservatives' double standards have brought the United Kingdom' s House of Commons into disrepute, and there is a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this Parliament.	62.80299274466743
Thank you, Mr Murphy.	14.221496226011018
As I informed Mr Davies, I promise to look into this matter this very evening with the quaestors.	40.92372532638355
Madam President, on a point of order.	32.99230105435773
I have already written to you on a number of occasions concerning how points of order are raised in the House.	49.37220421071821
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies was speaking.	78.7532210849208
Why did he not mention the fact that one of his own Liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the BBC?	68.77502587128645
Is this House going to let its agenda be determined by scurrilous reports on a programme which bases its news items on lies, or is it going to get down to serious work and address the challenges facing Europe?	145.82838105440072
Gentlemen, obviously the quaestors who look into this matter are not going to be basing their assessment just on information from radio programmes.	130.12002807302144
They will look into the matter thoroughly.	62.88060287289719
Madam President, I believe I am expressing the feeling of a great number of Members of Parliament in most of the political groups when I say that the message which the President of the Commission sent to the new Austrian Chancellor a week ago created some unease.	42.00237698436832
Was it in fact necessary in this message to specifically offer his best wishes for success, or to say, "I am sure that you will demonstrate the same commitment as shown by your predecessors to liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms" , or indeed that he awaited productive and constructive cooperation?	109.96492563268689
This is why, Madam President, I should like to see Mr Prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words, so that nobody, absolutely nobody, can use this message, which is unusual and unwise, to say the least, to contribute, and that includes counter to the intentions of Mr Prodi, towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in Austria a commonplace.	83.7733460824301
Thank you, Mr Wurtz.	30.2843169986906
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, not to start a debate at this point. This was just a procedural motion.	26.492190332456335
Let me remind you, Mr Wurtz, that we shall be seeing Mr Prodi tomorrow. He is going to make a statement on the Commission' s programme.	29.426728969973606
Naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him questions in the speeches you make following this statement, just as Mr Prodi will be perfectly free to answer you.	142.28137160558583
I suggest that you clarify this matter at that time, if you so wish and if Mr Prodi agrees.	73.73836950063547
Madam President, it is with great regret that I have to trouble you yet again with an issue that I have raised here twice before.	52.16002399472033
I have already told you on a number of occasions that we, on behalf of the Dutch contingency, would like a Dutch television channel.	41.55859775597826
There are now 28 channels here in this Parliament, including two Greek, one Portuguese, one Finnish and one Belgian, but still no Dutch, and as many as seven English, six German and six French.	211.65822750094392
I was promised back in September that there would be a Dutch channel by January.	65.40883798902559
It is now February and we are still waiting.	97.28857300506426
I would ask you once again to work on this.	18.14423467345671
I wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy is at work here preventing a Dutch channel from being transmitted by satellite.	74.18344158471314
Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, let me say how disappointed I am, because I personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago.	112.9347229160015
I have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and I believe that Mrs Banotti has an answer for you.	41.2040329431509
I shall therefore, with your permission, give the floor to Mrs Banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion.	54.17991596207877
Madam President, as my dear friend Elly will know, I will do anything to make her and my Dutch colleagues happy.	73.5664561642956
I would like to assure you as quaestor in charge of this issue that we have had technical discussions about the various channels on television and radio, and I have already started mailing colleagues in this connection.	50.82198268158433
If it is of any comfort to her, the Irish have not got their channel yet either.	121.22200715498039
There seem to be intractable technical problems but we are definitely working on it.	54.606533762152196
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this.	20.49707166037566
I am not so sure that our Dutch Members will be reassured on the grounds that the Irish Members too are unable to receive a national channel.	39.07832146148823
I think we must do what we can to see that all Members can receive their own national channel.	36.34695971832485
Thank you, Mrs Banotti, and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this.	27.8119271792736
Madam President, I should like to tell Mr Wurtz that the Commission' s doctrine is not the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty and that, until proved otherwise, we are not in the situation where Articles 6 and 7 would be applicable.	39.83055011527224
Austria, therefore, is perfectly entitled to form its government and the President of the Commission is perfectly entitled, and even duty bound, to offer Austria his best wishes.	203.18191200411357
Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party, the French Communist mayors, were sending bulldozers against immigrant hostels in France.	114.37716773470753
Agenda	634.2024716887657
The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents, pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	19.495819574619194
a) Sittings from 14 to 18 February 2000 in Strasbourg Relating to Wednesday:	190.32870315184047
President.	1057.4422134367323
In view of the fact that no Council representative is able to attend on Wednesday evening, a number of groups - the Group of the European People' s Party, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left - requested that the Council statement on the Cyprus question and Mr Brok' s report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta were dealt with during the joint debate and that these two items plus Mr Swoboda' s report were brought forward in the agenda.	21.697474749787272
This would then give us, for Wednesday' s sitting, the two Council statements on the coherence of Union policies with development policy and on the UN 'Human Rights' sitting, followed by the joint debate on Cyprus and then the reports by Mr Swoboda, Mr Corrie, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Knörr Borràs.	78.21771188811887
Is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal?	27.58536939307951
Since no one wishes to speak, I shall put this proposal to the vote.	53.33848447724969
(Parliament gave its assent)Relating to Thursday:	102.87060803003902
President. I have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	38.63767101589692
On the subject of human rights, I have received two proposals for additions: one from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party for an item entitled 'Cambodia' and the other from the Group of the Greens, for an item entitled 'Pinochet' .	33.185874202041646
As you know, we can only include five items in the 'Human Rights' section.	69.9220612006533
According to the list given in the final version of the agenda, there are already four items.	59.691835452998276
We can therefore table only one additional item.	140.54330088281884
Who wishes to speak on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to propose the addition of an item on Cambodia?	20.38650711771772
Madam President, it is remarkable that the European Parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of Mr Pinochet, despite the fact that international arrest warrants have already been issued.	29.956724062887574
Since the Belgian Government' s appeal to a higher court was declared admissible last week and since the decision has essentially not yet been taken, it is important for Parliament to at last give out a strong message, a message which should signify that nobody can escape a just trial.	86.33406920195097
It is inconceivable that the European Parliament, which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights, should fail to adopt a clear stance on this.	54.2605682056899
Madam President, this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time.	30.71518759510353
Firstly, the European Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of General Pinochet, but, furthermore, there are certain questions to be borne in mind.	40.38621338547029
The first is that this matter is sub judice in several European countries, and I would like to remind Members that there is still no European judicial area nor a European legal system.	36.31738674684548
We are in favour of the International Criminal Court, but it does not yet exist.	30.517772283511388
Secondly, there is currently a democratically elected government in Chile, led by Ricardo Núñez, whose first declaration was that all those who have committed this type of crime must face justice, and I would remind you that the Chilean justice system, which is independent, is currently examining 60 complaints lodged against General Pinochet, concerning his crimes against humanity.	111.8304932790888
I believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up, but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure.	19.002051327472632
We believe that justice should be done in this case, but this is not the most appropriate procedure.	23.17107005216017
(Parliament rejected the proposal) President.	95.6763157241724
We now come to the third proposal which is for 'Environmental disasters in the waters of the Danube' , a proposal tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.	31.644159706621277
Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?	22.195387788974013
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what has occurred in a tributary of the Danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the Chernobyl disaster.	39.5714247933739
It affects not only Romania, but also Yugoslavia and, in fact, the entire Danube basin.	107.30685761747938
We consider the matter to be important enough for the Commission to react swiftly to this situation, and I think that Parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject.	47.319507277631764
(Parliament gave its assent) President.	109.035266029942
Still relating to Thursday' s sitting, the PPE Group has requested that Mrs Cederschiöld' s report on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro should be brought forward to Wednesday as the last item on the agenda.	43.69100677500696
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal?	22.482418472246348
Madam President, the agenda has been rearranged so many times that I would simply ask the Chamber to support the present proposal.	30.177816901588447
It is not a very time-consuming matter, but it is extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delays.	30.271597424758315
It is in fact about protecting the euro against counterfeiting, which is an extremely urgent matter.	38.72012280917114
We have tried to drive this proposal through.	44.8972418330916
I should therefore be very grateful indeed if the Chamber could support it.	49.50466690450956
(Parliament gave its assent)	57.786768702382076
Relating to Friday: President.	315.1520105731193
Relating to Friday, on Friday morning we have an oral question on postal services and the Group of the Party of European Socialists is requesting that the motions for resolutions should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in Brussels, as envisaged in the final version of the draft agenda.	46.344659393662184
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PSE Group in favour of this proposal?	19.633704662213727
Madam President, with apologies to my friend, Enrique Barón Crespo, I should like to speak against this proposal.	15.727659647060928
I am surprised it has even been made, because we came to an agreement following an exchange in the Conference of Presidents.	43.82120138561158
I think that your proposal, Madam President, to keep the debate and the vote separate, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date, is a reasonable one.	39.00636739306587
The reason is as follows: this issue concerns no less than 1 800 000 employees within the European Union.	41.91100729000989
We already have a directive.	49.60038587098341
It is not an old one, it was issued in 1997.	33.84571620176736
Deciding upon future policy lines, with a view to a new directive, rather hastily, without having had time to consult the trade unions or have discussions with all the social partners, I feel, runs counter to the spirit we wish to inject into the debate on matters which directly involve the social operators.	112.60949839601601
I propose, therefore, that we should keep the arrangements as per the agenda, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date.	53.56771426720246
Madam President, I clearly owe Mr Wurtz an explanation, and I am going give this explanation before the whole House.	102.79034037289232
We had reached this agreement on principle in the Conference of Presidents.	40.336664992153175
At the time, I did not know that Commissioner Bolkestein was going to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter.	21.46213329332073
My group has debated this matter and considers that, given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area, it is appropriate that Parliament makes an initial statement, regardless of any action it may take in the future, so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week' s debate.	58.15621563352864
Madam President, I should simply like to ask Mr Wurtz to take a second look at what this is about.	26.669248546272744
It has nothing to do with any disputes on the substance; it is just about the following question: when will the Commission - having already had a year and a half to do this - finally be in a position to table the directive?	61.55967552706913
Our sole intention in tabling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adhered to, and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible.	58.624806861138
That is why I should like to support the Social Democrats' request to hold the vote on Friday.	40.61830651798848
(Parliament gave its assent)	57.786768702382076
Madam President, as you know the Cederschiöld report has been taken off Thursday' s agenda. That ought to mean that we have more time on Thursday.	52.86571818039252
Since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate, in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half, I simply wanted to ask whether the sessional services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time.	48.6572891709567
In general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very chaotic.	34.67235846046458
Last Thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one-and-a-half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote.	106.53994377523765
On Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda.	71.46851968596198
That is absolutely absurd.	48.14176221671831
I really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed.	26.65471074788185
This sounds perfectly feasible. We shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour, considering the withdrawal of Mrs Cederschiöld' s report.	78.89014359533378
This is all I am talking about here, just that.	45.624215782599336
Madam President, I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday, which you have not yet announced.	27.47833522999415
I understand that there is no argument about the fact that the Council declaration, on the next sitting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, is not going to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part-session in March, so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way.	32.97169076753313
I understand that there is agreement on this issue.	18.609695152321134
Madam President, this afternoon, in this Chamber, reference was made to a series of reports on the BBC Today programme this morning, which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lobbying companies or somehow misusing their position as Members of this House.	73.31638146059757
These are serious allegations.	44.58932191740636
They are completely untrue, malicious, politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood.	49.36790789112687
We are taking legal advice.	110.3413201480053
My colleagues' register of interests is complete.	176.11023834589403
If we find that any Member of this House or their employees collaborated with the BBC in this farrago we will expose them to the opprobrium of this House.	40.401227511641
Quite, we agree absolutely.	271.26468852328605
b) Sittings of 1 and 2 March 2000 in Brussels	149.61990708802944
Sustainable urban development - rural development - EQUAL initiative	273.0430925897916
. (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners and members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was given the task of drawing up the European Parliament' s report on the Community Initiative Programme INTERREG III.	20.95584334818077
Upon referral to committee, we examined over a hundred amendments and, so far, 17 amendments, some of which have already been presented in committee, have once again been tabled.	110.01107843437666
Before discussing the content of the resolution, I should like to inform you of the elements which I took account of and which guided my work as rapporteur.	59.02231947094814
First of all, I would like to remind you of the function of the INTERREG Community initiative, founded on the principle of transnationality and innovation.	22.29573466529372
This programme constitutes a driving force for development on the European scale.	42.557279263426146
INTERREG is one of the four Community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000-2006, and is the one with the largest budget for implementation, i.e. EUR 4.875 billion as opposed to EUR 3.604 billion at the present time.	48.940321877712
The INTERREG initiative, created in 1990, is built upon the wish to make the regions of Europe ready for a 'Europe without frontiers' in the context of establishing the great single market.	57.85009693367182
At the time of the reform of the Structural Funds in 1994 and 1996, the INTERREG CIP has incorporated new strands contributing to the development of trans-European transport and energy distribution networks.	47.045556469417434
These programmes promoted cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation within the European Union by encouraging balanced development of the Community area.	54.95798084941232
The INTERREG III programme, for which we have before us today the guidelines issued by the European Commission, pursuant to the terms of European Community Regulation No 1260 de 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, continues these measures.	55.354406922265895
It is based on three strands. strand A organises cross-border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions, at both internal and external borders of the European Union, on the basis of joint cross-border development strategies which Member States' local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing. strand B governs transnational cooperation between national, regional and local authorities in various Member States or applicant countries regarding regional development, transport networks and the environment.	55.274724917934414
Member States, i.e. national authorities, are responsible for implementing this strand. Finally, strand C organises interregional cooperation between different regions of the Member States or third countries to exchange experience under strands A and B and cooperate in the fields of research and technological development, subject to consultation with the European Commission which is responsible for its implementation.	87.90979279237779
The new INTERREG programme, in the form in which we have received it, takes into consideration the needs engendered by enlargement to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and to island regions and most remote regions.	57.68113729566453
The Commission proposes redistributing the INTERREG funding as follows: between 50 and 80% for strand A, 6% for strand C, and the remainder for strand B, i.e. from 14 up to a maximum of 44%.	123.30483164452193
The European Commission draws up the list of eligible regions for strand A and strand B. It bases its assessment principally on the map of regions eligible during the previous programming period.	80.8150938786174
The most remote regions may benefit from support under strand B. The Commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand A is not comprehensive, but is comprehensive for strand B. The Commission reserves the option to, at a later date, put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions, for strand C.	94.86618751567379
The adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on Structural Funds.	54.80055142194832
Proposals are drawn up by Member States and are submitted for approval to the European Commission, which checks their conformity with the general guidelines, adopted.	80.19761913371853
These proposals must include a number of elements, an overview of the cross-border or transnational priorities and strategies, a description of the measures necessary to their implementation and an indicative financial plan.	90.34028014634976
I belong to the great majority of Members of Parliament who voted in favour of continuing the INTERREG Community Initiative Programme. I regret that Parliament was not informed about the appraisal of the previous programme, which would have enabled the new measures implemented to reach optimum efficiency, but I acknowledge that this was not an easy operation.	59.19596982068147
I also regret the fact that we had an extremely short period to work in, as the text was examined in parliamentary committee on 24 November last year and then on 26 January. I further regret the fact that neither the regions, nor the representative regional organisations were involved in framing the programme.	70.73349612858026
In promoting cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation, this cross-disciplinary instrument is the very incarnation of a regional policy on the European scale intended to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the Community territory.	58.05472547710078
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union' s priorities since it is essential in order to maintain the existence and continued development of agriculture, to provide farmers with an environment containing the necessary infrastructure and services, and to ensure greater respect for the environment and a better quality of life, diversification and job creation.	60.89089477756513
An integrated development policy for all rural areas in the European Union is therefore needed, consisting of the following elements: an integrated, multi-sectoral approach, simplification of administrative procedures, improvement of the partnership between European institutions and national and local actors and protection of the environment.	83.25100643094636
In its 1998 policy paper, Agenda 2000, the Commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based: the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for developing rural areas.	61.201925872725155
The first principle means creating a new 'pact' between farmers and society, making the farmer 'steward of the countryside' and ensuring that society is prepared to pay for the environmental services needed to safeguard the countryside' s recreation value.	77.94829505396888
The second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector, so that a complete development programme which integrates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented. In this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the CAP.	52.898688360206
The LEADER Community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bottom-up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs.	65.23745901558556
The following objectives were set: improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas.	159.81068056304858
LEADER I applied to the rural areas covered by Structural Fund Objectives 1 and 5b, and 217 local action groups participated in it, with financing of EUR 1 155 million.	149.14287617676905
LEADER II (1994-1999), for which a total evaluation has, unfortunately, not yet been completed, had a wider scope than LEADER I: there were probably over 800 beneficiaries and the sums allocated, after reallocation of resources, probably amounted to over EUR 4 000 million.	212.98135446952693
In October 1999, following the success of LEADER I and LEADER II, the Commission decided to extend the initiative.	69.67786249797017
For the 2000-2006 period provision has been made, unfortunately, only for a total contribution of EUR 2 020 million, and an indicative allocation for each Member State has been set.	46.67316857110748
LEADER+ differs from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible. It is also more ambitious, and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet.	71.70261496528404
The main changes are as follows: all rural areas will be eligible to benefit from LEADER+; the selection criteria for local measures will be more rigorous; integrated local development plans will be introduced as priority themes, such as the use of information technology, improving the quality of life, and adding value to local products.	90.4548530050617
I therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because, as I was saying, it emphasises the innovative development strategies and because it is more ambitious, even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qualify as rural more flexible so as not to penalise rural areas with high or low population densities.	109.71174499636616
I believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skills and for the implementation of joint projects between different areas of the Union and I repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measures already in existence, such as the Carrefours.	57.610109410275776
I share the Commission' s preference for the use of global grants while urging, however, that the accounting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and painstakingly defined.	69.40757118318344
I regret the delay with which LEADER, as was the case with the other three initiatives, was presented to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure.	84.51695068813265
Finally, I am concerned by the paucity of the amount allocated, if you consider, in addition, that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the Union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous LEADER II.	56.388927353151566
I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation, and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments.	21.957823231345664
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on EQUAL takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative, whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	49.32715265851718
The report was a major undertaking because it also incorporates opinions from four further committees - from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.	32.896946151297996
This Community initiative succeeds the two forerunner programmes ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT and has a much smaller budget of around EUR 2.8 billion.	105.99921033767016
The initiative adopts a completely new approach, which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships.	196.71461367718263
The intention is clear: targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level, projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities.	88.777021834978
This objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this House.	30.70707470364034
In addition, EQUAL should feed into the National Action Plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these Action Plans.	106.73428683758758
It is an important Community initiative which, together with the three other initiatives, URBAN, LEADER and INTERREG, is financed out of the Structural Funds.	85.68937965797393
In my report I have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships.	67.14102215081994
I consider technical support to be necessary but, given the problems with the former TAOs, no new TAOs should be set up without Parliament' s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level.	112.64719957373184
Nevertheless, technical assistance is necessary.	106.42128515142348
Particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice, with special emphasis on mainstreaming.	157.54091940296394
I have endeavoured to secure the widest possible support for the report.	31.37649320689691
This has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises.	111.36758041936675
A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers.	42.67684012800052
However, in this context, Madam President, to allow us to work out the details, I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday.	53.769872304045485
I believe that it is important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the Commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the European Parliament, because Parliament put the appropriations for EQUAL in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that Members' ideas were also reflected in this Community initiative.	47.84301676310853
In this connection, the European Parliament is also justified in insisting that it should be possible to amend the thematic priorities only after a further hearing in Parliament.	48.48921768075799
EQUAL should live up to its name, and this is my firm intention.	110.41811191092542
It should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union.	28.20687532097918
It should prevent society from splintering.	90.26604487708804
It should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life.	121.38124374198198
Everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age, gender or origin.	125.01652285506893
That is my intention and I would ask the House to give this report overwhelming support!	26.54378094070585
Madam President, it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I am here!	56.7697904443811
Just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it axed the URBAN initiative.	87.8947452829424
Yet we as politicians knew that there was a groundswell of support for continuing this initiative into the year 2000.	47.081900856844825
Parliament, therefore, can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn.	88.12577107080104
Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy.	31.371346880607327
In my Member State, for example, we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government taskforce is looking at the problems of urban communities.	62.71327637915157
With eight out of ten people in Europe living in urban areas, it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation, social exclusion, joblessness, crime, drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that.	129.6100188040859
For example, in my own region, in Manchester, the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success.	35.7133840622791
URBAN funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK, in Moss Side.	62.41857905089587
The Millennium Youth Park project is helping to get young people re-engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community.	67.86812541968084
The work of this URBAN agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous British pubs.	112.35864019687185
This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in terms of communication and publicity.	36.65174111253009
As regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative, they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity.	73.17353450282214
We agree that they ought to be indicative in nature, allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes.	87.21702255836887
In committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50.	44.29632253800325
We are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of 50 is not the key factor.	65.1909385739295
Instead, we should go for good-quality projects that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal, to attract inward investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect.	70.42592331251745
The Member States should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations.	28.07463567640649
In the designation of local URBAN programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas.	59.121723383695
In the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes.	87.18400768477865
This needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the EU criteria.	40.24900516228378
I would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that.	46.694672337339696
Our most deprived urban neighbourhoods face a plethora of problems: high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment, poverty and social exclusion.	197.3534004893878
Often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency.	97.57652853242017
We therefore have unstable communities which are infiltrated with crime, drug-dealing and gangs.	76.15682235176719
This is all too familiar in many of our urban areas.	48.427557300598835
All these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents, yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity.	88.84693978691749
That is why again, in my report, I have asked that action under the URBAN Programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem: these areas do not have single, "mono" problems.	71.63430077707207
Instead, communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems, using EU resources as a value added to local actions.	172.43553567400483
I would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti-discrimination, as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty.	60.86703265048409
The Community initiative means community involvement.	177.39249327340485
Some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents.	60.120343934895125
We need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes.	33.05662084047734
The time-scale therefore proposed by the Commission is very ambitious.	59.06984572657752
It is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation.	158.91824579219585
The Commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disclose the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice.	57.22715603405297
This is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks.	36.47815334640836
Finally, I should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the post-industrial city we require local participation.	42.4303744707044
We need to deploy the energies of the unemployed, the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems.	50.40094129825962
We shall thereby be able to replace poverty, dependency and alienation with equity, initiative and participation.	93.83001862166444
This will help us to restore the credibility of the EU and the confidence of citizens that Europe can deliver local action to solve local problems.	51.532556538202925
. (IT) Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, has already pointed out, we can certainly consider URBAN a success for the European Parliament with regard to the debate held last year on the reform of the regulations.	37.26186682643154
As we have heard, the objective of URBAN is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas, bearing in mind that 80% of the population of Europe lives in cities.	45.37799232370067
Creating a functioning urban environment in terms of social policy requires a policy of long-term job creation, action to combat poverty, measures to assist low-income groups and old people, facilities for children, racial and ethnic integration, better opportunities for participation, a targeted public health policy including measures to prevent drug abuse and concerted crime prevention measures.	141.9392339959783
The Communication from the Commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic, social, and infrastructural measures.	39.196705167779726
However, we must remember that, in addition to URBAN, a number of other Community instruments are also available in the social sector: innovative actions under Article 6 of the ESF regulation, pilot projects, particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introduced by the European Parliament under the 2000 budget and the EQUAL and INTERREG initiatives and mainstream ESF activities.	70.98735173638772
As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stressed in its opinion, the Commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergies in this context while avoiding duplication of multiple funding.	46.404541748826404
While, on the one hand, we believe that steering committees should ensure that the various projects are coherent and complementary, we would on the other hand urge the Commission to reinforce exchanges of information and coordination between the departments involved.	48.308779099948644
Not only is this coordination essential but, as we stated in our opinion, exchanges and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential.	100.48770879415252
Mr President, the importance of this initiative is increasing constantly as economic and social problems in Europe' s cities intensify and the public feels more and more out of touch with the administration of its city or neighbourhood.	70.0828514933794
That situation will be compounded by social reclassifications resulting from European Union enlargement, and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities.	45.813301307633914
Addressing those problems is all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of cities into the surrounding areas and in view of the cities' historical and cultural role.	126.30406173520032
However, in order for such an effort to succeed it is necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enlist the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affected by the economic and social crisis.	40.38463428927019
Here, we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of women, and the agencies that represent them, in planning and implementing the URBAN initiative programmes.	88.6861388575299
As the Committee on Equal Opportunities, we also stress the need to finance infrastructures that will facilitate professional activity by women, mainly by harmonising their professional and family commitments, and more generally infrastructures that promote solidarity between the generations, social solidarity.	175.69337225170042
Effective implementation of this initiative could have a cumulative result because it could inspire similar action at regional and local levels, thus increasing its political importance still further since women need to feel the effects of European policy in their day-to-day life in real terms.	138.19986353946751
Mr President, our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the Commission for the URBAN programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention.	76.51736728058947
In committee we thought that it was necessary for the economic and social regeneration of urban areas to go hand-in-hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities and therefore for measures designed to reduce racism and xenophobia to be an integral part of programmes to be funded by URBAN.	57.020577334562596
We considered that increasing public confidence by combating everyday urban crime was one of the central tasks of urban regeneration.	203.2571084315207
Our committee noted that innovative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole array of measures including the incorporation of crime prevention in town planning, action to prevent juvenile delinquency, the reintegration of offenders, and models for effective local cooperation between the various parties involved, for example the police, the courts and social services.	92.25422245485238
We adopted our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we felt that it was particularly important to continue URBAN - which in the past has been implemented successfully - because, as we see it, programmes of this kind are the only way in which we in the European Union will succeed in ensuring that in the long term all those who live in the European Union enjoy peaceful coexistence.	55.164451766954805
For this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind.	28.758687229152944
I should like to comment on the concerns which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has with regard to the largest of the four Community initiatives, INTERREG III.	28.35086159619308
It must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under INTERREG III.	61.74729771561728
In the light of the fact that 50% of unemployment in the Union is essentially structural and given the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border regions - I need only refer to the possibility of unwelcome migration - this is not only reasonable but imperative.	50.994626111280006
The measures eligible for funding listed in Annex II of strand A do also seem encouraging in this respect.	225.31051446406602
In reality, however, the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects.	62.368447699243184
I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures, especially in areas with high levels of long-term and youth unemployment.	36.628574051994924
Employment policy measures should also be eligible for funding under strand B, especially for the applicant countries as part of the pre-accession strategy.	40.21266191727442
In general where the employment policy measures are concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for appointments to the joint cooperation committee to be made on a regional basis - because the local expertise required for these specific purposes is only available at regional level - so as to avoid these measures becoming too abstract and therefore proving disappointing.	71.56052358112801
The fact that administrative expenditure on INTERREG III is - in my opinion - still excessive is something which we can and indeed always must criticise, although it almost seems to me as though this is unavoidable with the Commission' s support programmes.	102.51651999746424
However, I should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fatal. It is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simplified as possible so that the social dimension of the EU is once again given the importance which it deserves.	30.653428399617113
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism considered, amongst other things, the report on LEADER+ and, as a result, agreed to support the process of decentralisation in the management of actions, believing that that process could be effective on two conditions: that local action groups represent the general interests of the local community, and that Commission control mechanisms are utilised to prevent local and regional political authorities from using LEADER+ resources to support civil groups and organisations which are related to those authorities.	92.48766559238216
We ask for a guarantee that the decision-making bodies for the projects are represented equally by three elements: political representatives and public administrations, companies and economic operators, and social operators, including unions and non-governmental organisations.	91.69308085780413
We would particularly like to stress that there must be balanced representation between men and women in all of these bodies.	26.250735204330557
We would also like to stress that the main objective is the promotion of strategies for sustainable development, whose positive effects would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself, and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integrated into the development programmes, included in Objectives 1 and 2, and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are located.	58.008430871303695
We are pleased that all the rural areas of the Union may be involved in LEADER+, but we believe that it is necessary to concentrate Community resources in the less-favoured regions in order to facilitate the process of socio-economic cohesion within the Union, and that state governments should not divert these resources towards objectives other than cohesion.	44.3044764315469
The Committee believes that projects financed under action 1 should place value on the potential of endogenous development, in particular based on local traditions, techniques and practices, on specific production and on the management of sustainable energy.	142.0333430227932
The Committee supports the Commission proposal to concentrate actions in small selected areas and believes that, given the dispersed nature of many rural inhabited locations, the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduced to 10 000 inhabitants.	77.88881076425174
We believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and management mechanisms of actions 2 and 3, financed by LEADER, with those of other actions financed by other Community programmes relating to interregional and international cooperation and partnership, such as INTERREG, SAPAR, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA, in the same areas.	100.61625447231224
Mr President, Mrs Stenzel, ladies and gentlemen, before addressing the EQUAL report itself, I should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guidelines on which the report is based.	30.046120897433088
The basic objectives of an EU-wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability, entrepreneurship and adaptability.	56.87030882796659
These objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy.	63.43942091548145
However, the aim of an approach which really sought to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people' s self-determination.	71.58891931375167
Only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives.	209.5509459227068
Mrs Stenzel' s report has, however, turned out very well, at least where the prescribed guidelines are concerned.	62.06894792926428
All asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes, although this should be self-evident.	82.3598059922469
Nevertheless the Conservatives voted against this in the committee.	75.50333204519447
I would ask them the following questions: does your policy seek to marginalise people?	90.56620265084032
What is the idea behind preventing people from working when they wish to do so?	53.530306727268204
Does this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability?	86.0109768582293
It is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstreaming programme, because there remains a shortcoming in the report.	38.512435449162275
Particular emphasis is given to the point that women' s opportunities on the labour market ought to be improved and that to achieve this more crèches should be built.	62.18546128838662
Anyone who lets men happily climb the career ladder and worries only about childcare places without fighting against the way in which the work of reproduction is shared out unevenly has not - and unfortunately that includes women - understood the concept of mainstreaming!	131.05568018681979
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted this opinion on the EQUAL report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one abstention.	47.66383505972422
I am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.	30.528433491014525
This cross-group support for the opinion is explained by the conclusions, which are devoted to the question of how issues related to regional policy, transport and tourism can be combined with action to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	59.405415666543945
The members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of course also identify a number of areas of the Commission proposal which they would criticise: firstly, for example, the insufficient thematic guidelines laid down for the development partnership activities; secondly, the fact that strict selection criteria for evaluating the project proposals will only be drawn up only at a later stage by the Commission and thirdly, the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the Commission and the technical assistance bodies.	73.16435851896061
That is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure.	53.88721099991481
The committee based its conclusions on these critical comments.	175.28560024389296
We attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector, in tourism and in small and medium-sized enterprises with promoting the establishment of new small and medium-sized businesses bearing in mind the necessary economic structural change.	51.83088079325776
Dovetailing the activities under the Community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the EQUAL programme.	61.63760081110593
We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the EQUAL programme.	46.869461985788696
The specific target of deriving European added value brings the regional cooperation up to European level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators.	118.50620075527203
This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it.	15.700025676418269
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time.	17.04436620423214
However, criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee.	41.75994584948654
The reports are late, and, in addition, they were very hastily discussed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	26.522405447405003
A good opportunity to discuss the results, good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost.	175.94110816156834
Our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the European Union.	56.89892538498376
Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region, but, in my opinion, we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either.	90.28662139564862
Our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTERREG, TACIS, ISPA and PHARE programmes.	70.8926704440607
This coordination is at present lacking, and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it.	83.87271132870697
We here in Parliament are waiting for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible.	32.17442415129926
It is of decisive importance to get local business, organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes.	63.28159014797206
Experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful.	213.78354011612117
Projects have often remained half-finished, and their efficiency has been drained by administration and bureaucracy.	127.8086166056117
We also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement.	79.51627999826114
Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee.	30.36682776054731
I would like to mention here again the URBAN report, in which the rapporteur, in the explanatory statements, has dealt admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabitant as per the Commission' s guidelines.	54.14534685136248
It will not work as an automatic target, but must be applied in the target area according to prevailing conditions.	52.58124138134361
This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn.	119.18942509313696
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds.	24.390037909716177
Here, projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries.	202.52097627243086
Unfortunately this is only true for part of the money, that is only for the borders within the EU.	45.676327760535706
But it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation.	59.107234761939715
The regulation pretends that there is one, but there is not.	37.658057922833265
The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, although Parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time.	27.45451176788349
The practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded.	78.99776609095674
Since 1996, Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties.	55.75871739162858
Nothing has happened!	85.02655335848269
The difficulties are once again being allowed to persist, to the detriment of the regions concerned.	46.6339263736468
Parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation, and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other Commissioners.	81.12826166986287
We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pushers!	46.268293487674626
Mr President, a third of EU money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes.	68.78988337890823
According to my group, this is excellent if, as a result of this, deprivation within regions, towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved.	119.09528843785881
That is a question of solidarity and progress.	31.75990820952136
But dishing out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending.	131.73384455005964
The local councils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience.	188.5587155503297
They find it is extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy causes.	111.99042235671384
Anything related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly, but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval.	216.88584738892865
Since there is great uncertainty surrounding the way in which rules are interpreted, local councils and regions have now started to enlist the services of expensive bureaux. The task of these experts is to gauge to what extent European Commission officials would be prepared to approve plans.	99.39800678579046
In some cases, I get the impression that it is not about solidarity or alleviating the most desperate problems, but about propaganda and upholding vested interests in exchange for the European Union' s blessing.	43.463122207200186
It seems that the key goal there has become the construction and painting of propaganda panels advertising the fact that such and such a project has been co-financed by the European Union.	62.69079258712025
Too much money is wasted on propaganda and investigation bureaux, consultation and control, and a great deal of money ends up back in the country where it was collected in the first place.	59.98838859336156
After the planned accession of new Member States with their 100 million inhabitants, the prosperity level of which is at one third or two thirds of the average level of the current EU Member States, this squandering will generate even more protest.	91.99767681667578
In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Confederal Group of the European United Left was in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Nogueira Román, on LEADER.	17.256290052870053
He was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas.	40.69022657411707
If there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas, we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality.	135.748096122838
After all, innovation in areas that have already grown prosperous is paying dividends even now and taking place without European funding.	206.9739550163905
A second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local councils.	77.1019840006782
The emphasis is on local groups in which the authorities, non-profit-making organisations and profit-making companies join forces.	149.34377427261063
The discussion has centred on the allocation formula to be applied.	58.215479320408015
In this respect, one of the variants considered is reminiscent of the Dutch polder model, the structurally planned cooperation between government, trade unions and employers' organisations.	62.50128703234492
Let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population.	60.63398457269947
So, really, these bodies should already provide for a balance, and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process.	114.41191453519825
My group welcomes the fact that the union movement and environmental movement are expressly given their own roles to play, as their input in society is important in our view.	80.77976442164424
This could prevent local governments that are functioning in a short-sighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglecting their duty of input from the very start.	128.0951298128201
But the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that, unfortunately, democracy is not fully functioning yet.	119.65129783503217
One of the objections is that, due to the restricted role of the elected bodies, businesses gain more influence.	78.28114268335997
As long as the economy does not weigh up the needs of all in a democratic way but is more concerned with making a profit for the benefit of a few, it is questionable as to whether democracy functions better under the rule of employers than under the rule of local councils.	56.844362940640806
We believe in 'one man, one vote' more than 'one share, one vote' .	194.0064502094521
Mr President, there are economic frontiers within the European Union, and the internal market with the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is fully operating at this time.	35.8223683190373
But for the internal market to work effectively and for the single European currency to be a success it is important that all regions within Europe, of which there are over 100, can economically compete within this very challenging environment.	77.65117909055473
Some areas within the European Union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita.	59.13178858251463
There are poor regions within the Union which need to be given European assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the European Union structure.	45.80495709257175
That is why, when we look at the EU Financial Perspective between 1989 and 1993, and 1994 and 1999, we find such a large proportion of the EU budget was put aside for the administration of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund.	42.386947674890045
There are twin problems that still remain for many regions in Europe: firstly, the lack of adequate infrastructure in terms of road, water treatment facilities and related transport networks; secondly, the need to put in place initiatives to combat youth and long-term unemployment, which is a constant social problem in many urban and rural parts of Europe.	83.51927456681854
There must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a Europe of the cities alone.	39.63332615310876
We need to ensure that job creation initiatives are in place to promote employment opportunities in the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector in rural parts of Europe as well.	27.97532602824272
The core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programmes, namely, the new INTERREG III initiative, EQUAL and the LEADER+ scheme.	82.69812219953496
Between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the EU to promoting cross-border development, combating the problems of long-term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes.	63.12643968420002
Mr President, quite a few towns and cities within the European Union have to contend with deprivation.	38.546920408118176
The Member States do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately.	37.03880449179599
This is why it is useful for the European Union to continue to support the Member States and, if necessary, give additional support under URBAN.	36.281661052531824
Over the next seven years, the Commission' s proposals concerning URBAN will entail a reduction in both the Community budget and the number of areas standing to benefit.	41.593916177023424
In common with Mrs McCarthy, I have to note that the number of areas has been drastically reduced.	46.889938233870815
It is desirable for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the confines of a certain budget.	27.442771354644442
As far as the budget is concerned, as already stated, URBAN is there to support and complement national policy.	71.26318347220447
In order to generate extra means if necessary, I think it is entirely logical to turn first to the Member States and private investors.	52.4758037490228
Consequently, we cannot support Amendment No 2 of the Greens, as borne out in the committee meeting.	40.46355866406324
In addition, I am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood, especially where Community contributions are concerned, should incentivise.	80.52474968215704
Structural support is said to cause subsidy-dependence.	344.0473538720502
We would then be overreaching ourselves.	40.47138335175521
I would like to finish off by making a general comment on INTERREG.	26.20760467675861
In my opinion, funding for cross-border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions.	46.596794608480096
When projects are implemented, it is also important that they do not contravene general Community legislation.	58.18717171520921
According to the report issued by the Court of Auditors on the year 1998, this is not an imagined risk.	21.261559834451813
Hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects.	136.12119226502918
Before I begin I will take the liberty of expressing my consternation at the way in which Austria has been prejudged by 14 Council representatives.	91.3526774752396
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the reform of the Structural Funds the Community initiatives are being pruned to a total of four.	23.89292891496941
I welcome the continuation of INTERREG and the priority which it has been accorded.	46.68470947503823
However, the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems.	45.938679952879895
The regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines, although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the Structural Funds.	37.771940966368355
There is no direct transition between INTERREG II and III, the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding.	115.92594963039299
That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects.	190.72999396026543
When INTERREG is implemented, it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned.	65.22461282334595
This is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds deployed.	27.651579096891034
However, problems will arise in particular from the fact that under PHARE, for example, funds are managed on an annual basis and allocation of appropriations is project-related, whereas INTERREG funds are multiannual and are allocated on a measures-related basis.	207.73528695031555
This will cause practical problems in the future, and I hope that despite this it will be possible to implement INTERREG effectively.	46.85018984944176
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community initiative LEADER proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas.	48.14616992845284
The preservation of this Community initiative in particular, in the form of a new version - LEADER+ - is therefore greatly to be welcomed.	40.91809593819481
The new LEADER+ programme now covers all rural areas in the European Union, which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects.	69.99728657745942
It is important for there to be coordination between LEADER+ and the other support initiatives in the European Union, but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important.	57.29940574276761
Overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effects.	40.01599774792246
In this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under LEADER is very welcome.	79.41881900749726
Agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LEADER initiative.	24.990919405218833
In the same way, through the LEADER initiative, structural change in agriculture can be supported by creating new jobs in rural areas.	47.082821332234694
Attention must be paid in the LEADER+ programme to all the sectors of the economy in rural areas; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result.	61.37124801001793
LEADER must now move into the implementation phase.	117.3427953013707
The operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the Commission, which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible.	59.90403550757125
Five months are provided for this.	68.24557406927072
That seems to me to be rather too long.	32.1482000909164
Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times.	109.2343171536166
Because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible.	89.94479134013032
Despite all the delight over the reworking of this Community initiative LEADER+, I do still have one further concern.	62.71124293872549
In its proposal the Commission called for an observatory for the LEADER+ programme without going into detail on how this proposal would be implemented.	61.507975605332625
For me this raises the following questions: who will work there?	127.43180854297148
How will these people be selected?	58.840452049828706
Where, above all, will the required money come from, and where should this observatory be located?	166.78783969681626
I do think, though, that the LEADER+ programme has not got a penny to spare on additional administrative tasks, which in the normal course of events would have to be carried out by the Commission in any case.	34.371185092788885
In addition, experience from other fields where observatories have been set up shows that, apart from rather dubiously creating jobs, they are not of any great benefit.	107.0903291602162
I would therefore call on the Commission to fulfil its monitoring duties directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that LEADER+ programmes run smoothly.	63.37462769054715
Assessment and publication are part of this, and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past.	60.599530621288054
Mr President, the majority of the borders, which have divided Europe for centuries, were artificially created, separating single geographic spaces and creating serious disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion.	87.02903830174525
Our internal borders, or what remains of them, no longer cause wars, but they do continue to generate economic backwardness, social barriers and a lack of cultural communication between the peoples of Europe.	108.31620560481095
The Community' s institutions are obliged to work towards overcoming these border scars, which contradict the spirit of European unity.	78.75712663782296
The economic and social cohesion which we propose is based, by means of the INTERREG initiative, on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border areas and the outermost regions of our continent.	37.16448438054024
INTERREG has always been at the heart of a genuine Community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our European territory.	49.096365018364125
Although the European Parliament supports this initiative, our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of INTERREG II.	84.53645853727804
However, we are aware that we must not delay this third version further, since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway. The success of INTERREG is clear and that is the opinion of the local, regional and national authorities which have participated in the cofinanced projects.	55.30354067414958
The people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together, of innovation, of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and tolerating each other.	105.57206363733239
There are many interesting questions relating to it, the monitoring centre, the principle of concentration etc. However, I would like to concentrate on the management bodies.	61.280654785073025
We must create joint, interregional and transnational management bodies, in which all local and regional authorities, as well as economic and social operators, play an active role.	65.40599981844028
There must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border.	65.90980774631815
We must create a cross-border culture, and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation, imaginatively overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each Member State, in each region and each municipality.	65.87735036326374
A project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication.	54.78772263263906
During debates in committee, we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating INTERREG with other annual or biannual financial instruments, such as MEDA, TACIS or PHARE.	149.33245188874506
This Parliament' s motion for a resolution has been very attentive to these difficulties, making proposals capable of solving them to the Commission and setting reasonable deadlines for making the necessary changes.	61.96470690849776
Mr President, my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative, in Ireland in particular, has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area.	37.73093403593516
It is a sad fact that there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of communities in the European Union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage.	54.80585625935208
Even in Member States and cities that are extremely wealthy we have large numbers of people living in ghettos, in situations where there are inadequate facilities, where schooling is very poor, where the physical infrastructure is under-developed and where drugs and other phenomena are rife.	62.280866668161096
It seems to me that in order for the European Union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the European Union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstrate that the Union works for these citizens and their families.	29.925792718600423
The programme has been extremely successful in Ireland, as indeed I know it has been successful in other countries.	49.94788813441055
It was quite slow in getting off the ground there, but it was slow because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes.	72.74142362180741
It is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative.	78.112865446824
It would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the URBAN programme.	89.19982331744687
I should like to make one further point before I conclude: we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious URBAN development policy.	53.29858110672094
This, unfortunately, is not the case in Ireland.	28.246230802977
I applaud the innovative approach of the EQUAL programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market.	41.46887562886694
The development partnerships are a very clever idea, even though they are experimental.	43.505400688735044
I have two major concerns, however, about the development partnerships.	38.26454007061135
They should be accessible to smaller groups, accessible for them to be able to devise, implement and monitor the programmes.	79.81741140598768
We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme.	52.125227469716855
I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon, so that it becomes accessible to everyone.	68.48122629217093
I am glad to see that this was accepted into the report, but I cannot agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all.	35.26250422528061
My second concern was that some discriminated groups have specific problems, for example, disabled people' s access to the workplace.	63.83295227314621
Projects should also specifically address this problem.	156.45325310941948
These concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes.	86.1376368537977
I certainly intend to do that with organisations and groups in my constituency in the West Midlands.	67.48413983267181
I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees.	46.856043271856024
Although I am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with repatriation, having access to EQUAL, I would support the possibility of access for all other asylum-seekers and refugees.	69.82923363018205
It is only fair and right for them to be able to access EQUAL in the same way as everyone else.	46.822742141759534
Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, with the LEADER report, rural development is very much to the fore.	31.028828833078837
This does not happen all that often and it is gratifying, especially as the LEADER programmes have been key elements in the Union' s rural development policy.	50.669587093174755
It must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning, but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as, for example, areas experiencing depopulation.	40.34949612432934
It must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the LEADER programme, local operators have combined forces, debated and prepared projects.	135.8644653090078
These programmes have, therefore, been important channels for participative democracy, the rationale of the citizen for Europe.	85.8157706691385
So, the concept for LEADER+ should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes.	103.47982232519907
One urgent question is therefore raised: why, when this programme has been successfully run for ten years, is LEADER+ still classed as experimental?	145.6058259931277
Are there so many other European schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful?	142.46093496127804
For how much longer is the Commission going to leave LEADER at the experimental stage instead of bringing it online as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development?	93.85659891962905
Moreover, I wonder at the reduced guidelines to which the Commission wishes to restrict LEADER+.	92.99915334101009
At a time when, Commissioner, after Seattle, we Europeans are fighting on the grounds of multifunctionality in rural development projects, why should we confine ourselves to a few limited criteria with resources that are far from sufficient?	82.02905368749096
As an ecologist, let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many-sided approaches.	61.380701039522855
In this connection, the Commission is proposing to limit yet further the cooperation actions of local action groups to only candidate countries.	122.04897255094029
A better solution would be, as indeed the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism suggests, strengthened coordination between LEADER+ and the Community cooperation and partnership programmes, such as INTERREG, PHARE, SAPARD or MEDA.	60.64158904672426
The fact is, showing solidarity with Eastern Europe, is all very well, but it is not enough.	49.49641741212928
The tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south, particularly the countries around the Mediterranean, must not be abandoned.	42.1441958797962
Therefore, once more, we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision. Codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type, which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application.	206.60330079381592
Mr President, I have a few very brief comments.	23.34389631850316
We are debating the planning phase and guidelines for the four Community initiatives without access to any substantive and complete appraisal of the previous period. This is not very good at all.	57.7730755503538
Programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory, while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud.	167.30662791976394
The Community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain preconditions.	88.69772675843303
They must, however, not be subordinated to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy, but must develop their own self-sufficient role.	57.43377108847203
For example, adapting EQUAL to the objectives of employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations transforms this initiative into a new version of local employment contracts.	79.9153996470127
Extending the LEADER initiative to every area in the Union entails the risk of marginalising deprived areas even more, to the benefit of more developed areas.	86.43552380769016
The INTERREG initiative must include eligible areas with special emphasis on border areas, islands and both mountain and non-mountain areas, such as the prefecture of Arta in Greece, whose omission from Annex I of the Commission' s communication is ill-considered.	79.4228711841747
Mr President, rural development has been identified by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area, and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible, Commissioner Fischler.	31.96426892542229
Our response to rural decline has come late in the day, but I suppose better late than never.	109.62802122511219
Family farming is now recognised as central to the European agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed, certainly within the time-scale of Agenda 2000.	97.6686045585318
In my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms.	37.362132160853285
It behoves all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival.	41.36394986133948
As the Commissioner knows, farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities.	47.59156975897749
For this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development.	66.86587143552481
In this regard LEADER has established itself as an effective development initiative.	102.0753678620592
It provides the opportunity for local communities to identify their development potential and become actively involved in addressing those problems.	105.48174077189724
The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated.	44.46245259211094
Yet, through LEADER, there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy.	80.74729960432524
In conclusion, while welcoming Commission approval for LEADER+, I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme.	83.3482418515278
I urge you to look seriously at this problem.	38.32642560064746
A break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers.	89.48128720771079
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having read the Commission communication on the INTERREG III initiative, and pointing out that I took part in the vote on Mr Decourrière' s report within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like not only to expressly reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as presented and, particularly in the context of INTERREG III B, with the Commission' s recognition of activities contributing to the restoration of landscapes run down due the level of prices in the agricultural sector, a sector in which many associations, especially cynegetic, are already making enormous investments in my own country.	52.220136530644076
I should also like to give my considered support to the comments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, particularly and primarily in deploring the failure to integrate the most remote regions into strand A of the programme or in commenting upon the lack of precision in the selection criteria for the implementation methods for strand III C and, finally, in requesting that Members of the European Parliament should be involved in the European Observatory for cross-border, transregional and interregional cooperation.	45.046214492135405
I should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exaggerated tendency which, in the Commission communication with reference to INTERREG III and III B, involves associating environmental protection exclusively with the development of Natura 2000, which I think is often an excessively abstract means of safeguarding ecosystems, from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted.	98.3044172042425
Finally, if the Commission and the relevant Councils of Ministers permit, I should like to stress that the Members of the European Parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the INTERREG projects and, beyond that, of similar initiatives.	43.32688388714179
It would be even better if they were involved to a greater extent in the processes of framing and implementing the programmes concerned, otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authorities and even the citizens.	49.276631877375564
Mr President, first of all, I would like thank the rapporteur of the EQUAL report, Mrs Stenzel, very warmly for all the efforts she has made to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of us.	35.611225920793544
EQUAL is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light, doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds.	145.74614270151628
This is an arduous task.	15.602572557343544
Only, the number of people affected by these programmes has not really dropped.	43.57282223768447
This is why it is so hard to strike a balance, not only between the different countries or the different components, but especially between the different groups listed in the programme, and in fact this is what has preoccupied us to date.	50.9142517516551
Comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another.	114.49492408488263
I, for my part, have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme, and I have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the European Parliament devoting special attention to them.	45.51621985452284
Although a few other groups have been mentioned, it is the Member States, in particular, which are on the lookout.	36.983671108280426
For example, I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component, namely refugees.	60.73465476718926
I would, therefore, ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups.	25.3576602519092
It should not be the case that one Member State, under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle, can decide that all funding should go to one group.	66.39536252314227
I think that this will have to be monitored closely because otherwise we will end up in that situation against which Mr Meijer has warned us so vehemently, to wit, that vested interests will emerge and that people will think that the money is theirs to spend.	52.661736120397066
This is not the case!	7.641649197074111
It has to be redistributed time and again.	28.94410908025607
It should be used for innovative projects and it should not completely disappear into the Finance Minister' s treasury funds.	156.85685131256415
That is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here.	18.44732505254113
I believe that the remaining problems that we have faced within this Parliament, and which in large part stem from the fact that it is so difficult to strike the right balance, can be solved.	47.433138903237996
As far as the Commission is concerned, I hope it will be able to join in the compromise that is being concluded here in this Parliament, mainly with a view to reaching a balance.	39.31535376996453
I would just like to underline this - the situation is, of course, a little precarious - Parliament has, for the sake of convenience and safety, placed the EQUAL programme on the back burner for the time being, so that Parliament has yet to be persuaded of the way the funds are to be distributed.	52.207737553114235
I believe that this is actually a good thing.	13.308757782755887
The position of Parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear.	91.65155372961324
The Rules of Procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful.	53.522636942360464
Mr President, there is no doubt that the INTERREG initiative promotes efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union.	14.043149073651476
However, I should like to stress INTERREG' s particular importance for the Balkan area, where political developments and hostilities over the past few years have had major economic repercussions for neighbouring countries and especially for my own country, Greece, which is the only Member State on that long-suffering peninsula.	63.958418786048284
For Greece, for the neighbouring countries Italy and Austria, but also for Europe as a whole, the social and economic restoration of the Balkans, bringing political stability, is a vitally important matter.	93.70983013641224
So far, some Balkan countries have received aid from the PHARE and Obnova programmes, while others have not.	100.28264499893018
During the new programme period, in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instruments and regulations, such as ISPA and Sapard, it is considered absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strands of INTERREG with other financial aid to third countries.	65.51012581956816
Accordingly, we welcome the related references in Chapter 7 of the European Commission' s proposed general guidelines for INTERREG.	82.17265121882282
The efforts to coordinate the planning and so make it more effective must extend to all the programmes equally, and I say that because in the MEDA programme during the last period some problems arose which have to be overcome, so that we can have equal treatment for all the third countries participating in that programme.	77.93707093181503
I should like to end by saying that the planning of the new inter-state cooperation zones has taken no account of the Mediterranean' s geographical peculiarities, which would justify the creation of a special zone for coastal and island regions.	61.137289719378394
We therefore ask the Commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next comes up for review.	111.01991996078287
I end by stressing the need for the European Union to persist with such initiatives, which strive to eliminate inequalities between our regions, and to foster their harmonious development.	66.27668124123572
And since this is St. Valentine' s day, as a former Mayor of a regional city, I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European regions which need that love.	80.00530562027845
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles: preservation of jobs, stewardship of the countryside and, not least, local culture, because that is of the utmost importance.	81.78467899146675
Only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured.	103.42541127931281
We can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the Alps and they are devastating.	50.3407504657592
But I warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside.	93.66475449281468
And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore.	51.61686042333208
To really guarantee sustainability - a buzzword which has, since it gained new currency, become relatively devoid of meaning, but we all know what we mean by it - what is needed, amongst other things, is an integrated approach in the countryside towards, for example, tourism and agriculture.	167.25254716673962
The investment needs to be visionary.	31.570188940184117
Young, creative individuals must be made to feel an attachment to the countryside. If they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more.	201.66505953302345
None of us think much of the principle of indiscriminate, all-round distribution, and the pilot projects need to act, as it were, like avalanches and trigger other similar projects.	100.61366371694933
I would be in favour of supporting self-contained cycles of projects and, even though LEADER I and LEADER II may have had shortcomings here and there, overall they were certainly positive.	170.48837398517037
I should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the Nordic countries but also for mountainous areas - the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada, from where I have just returned - in respect of population size and density.	43.57628176894627
Mr President, I want to talk about the EQUAL report, especially the issue of the policy on refugees.	28.369280106220806
Last week, we had a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the Austrian Government.	32.08958775717221
Today, we are already discussing the Austrian coalition government' s policy on refugees because Mrs Stenzel, who is the author of the EQUAL report, of course represents Austria' s governing conservative party and its policy.	129.17867427638512
The most startling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the Geneva Convention, that is to say so-called quota refugees or UN refugees.	92.36761094148376
In actual fact, it is the other refugees, namely those outside the quota and those not covered by UN aid, who need aid the most.	246.6017851769696
The Committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the EQUAL programme on identical conditions.	101.82767825516036
Some members of the Committee, however, supported Mrs Stenzel' s proposal and wordings.	46.78195764496692
As I see it, this means that Mr Haider' s politics are already casting their shadow over this Parliament.	80.49772259508403
It is therefore crucially important that the Chamber should be as emphatic as it possibly can be in establishing the fact that all refugees are to have a place on the EQUAL programme.	37.52811407085719
I want, finally, to say that I had certain misgivings last week when we discussed the formation of the Austrian Government but, when it comes to discussing and criticising its policy on refugees, I have no misgivings.	49.95422386061329
I hope that the Chamber will be just as committed this time.	52.731276888346436
Mr President, during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999, when there were 13 different initiatives in operation, the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative.	137.49542723696962
The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe, a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States.	58.6750905798861
The INTERREG I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTERREG II programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of bridging closer social and economic development between bordering Member States.	95.90350898469708
Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland, I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III.	94.57450455168384
The Commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the INTERREG III programme, which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.	47.80892299120339
The European Union has played a key role in developing the border county region in Ireland over the years.	33.514011525540475
The European Union is the single largest contributor, with 80 million pounds to the International Fund for Ireland.	51.79878609221076
The European Union contributes 75% of the Peace and Reconciliation programme.	34.02358065870586
All in all, INTERREG, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process.	100.53697879811668
Mr President, I am taking the floor to speak about INTERREG, but I shall confine myself to a few criticisms, which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time.	42.60784873248376
We have all spoken favourably of this programme' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation, in addition to cross-border cooperation.	46.81365600638959
However, this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50-80% - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, for INTERREG IIIA. Therefore, we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand, regarding the selection of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory.	90.13266963490894
We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament' s position in practical terms, and not just with a formal tribute.	48.90220478355848
Cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and, where exceptions have been made for maritime areas, their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies.	107.35609242600083
This discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature.	152.83360857054288
This is in line with ongoing discrimination, which ignores Article 158 of the Treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies.	66.473449753957
More serious still is the fact that this is occurring while ignoring the new situation associated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of regions such as Malta.	52.48635175612874
This has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the NUTS III Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta and to include all the regions of the Adriatic which share a frontier with Balkan regions.	69.4022760077408
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express the satisfaction I have in noting that the most remote regions, including the French overseas departments, have received some attention in connection with the INTERREG III initiative, opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area, even though it is true that more could have been expected, particularly with regard to access to the various strands.	43.457184948489
For a long time, probably a survival of our colonial heritage, our regions have fixed their attention on the European mainland, ignoring and even scorning their closest neighbours.	98.8562752681363
That time is now past.	198.31523574703948
Our regions have become aware of belonging to an environment that they are connected to, not only in geographical terms but also in terms of their culture and the history of their peoples, hence the intensely expressed aspiration to become more deeply rooted in this environment.	74.8590544078823
This increased awareness does not, however, affect identity alone.	166.42446296775583
It is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets.	38.63672219786887
So, for example, the island of Réunion is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern Africa and those of south-east Asia.	51.414350493439045
It cannot afford to remain outside the regional alliances being forged in this area, lest it miss out on a historic opportunity, and the same applies to our regions in the Caribbean.	55.30267044515167
At last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment, the source of so much despair, if we can export to neighbouring countries the know-how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the European structural funds.	69.63790429206696
INTERREG appropriations may be used to make our regions into veritable European Union bridgeheads into these geographical areas, giving it worldwide scope.	142.98734887224356
I am counting on the Commission, and specifically on you, Commissioner, to allocate adequate resources for effective action.	58.07324812440545
Mr President, Commissioners, I greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation under INTERREG, but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas.	98.64136979244924
I understand the Commission' s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation.	61.709091999309074
Nonetheless, there are many maritime areas between which links are already established.	114.89115203321403
Various local authorities around the North Sea provide a prime example of this.	129.81276703569816
INTERREG could well allow enhancement of such cooperation.	196.86071580994724
In consequence, I seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand A and strand B. These adjustments include clarifying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and permitting greater development of practical and visible projects, particularly those of an infrastructural kind.	115.54565545156116
Such measures will put maritime and insular areas on an equal footing with other areas of the EU.	49.46239541408785
I hope for their adoption.	68.19251865935672
Mr President, our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the EQUAL initiative so that, if you are a British Muslim physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group: you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems, rather than being defined as the problem.	89.81257598849957
There is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared.	46.02516659900308
We also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tightening up of the transnational level.	41.44968949786181
We are concerned, therefore, as others have said, at the number of amendments which seek to exclude even further some of society' s most excluded, by aiming for a very narrow definition of "refugee".	61.4441002760187
My group will not be supporting those amendments.	49.184903109824255
We are also concerned at the number of amendments which, in seeking to introduce greater flexibility, run the risk perhaps of obscuring responsibility for the management of the EQUAL initiative.	54.31750672371717
Mr President, I am very pleased to see URBAN orientated towards a more integrated approach which attempts to solve interrelated problems.	59.720561817735295
Yet, there is some risk of dilution of effort. If we pursue too many objectives, our overall effectiveness suffers.	155.74004039660198
Of course, every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case.	74.59220696263283
But there is a common factor, a hard core, comprising unemployment, the resignation or withdrawal of public services and the disappearance of small and medium-sized enterprises, both commercial and other kinds.	90.81291037676746
I would wish URBAN to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation.	321.4669886719701
For this, of course, central policy must interact and be coordinated with development policy, so that the latter too can be reorientated and can work synergistically with the objectives of any URBAN programmes implemented in our countries, and so that it is not just using them as an alibi for its own shortcomings.	58.55122096542766
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall confine my observations to Mr Decourrière' s report.	11.205350334594856
The INTERREG Community Initiative Programme is an extremely important tool in terms of the development and regional planning of European territory, most particularly with reference to effectively taking into account the relationship between the centre of the European Union and its outlying regions.	40.100243561305284
INTERREG must, therefore, be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed European territory.	99.97840800322797
It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities, and their representative bodies, the Committee of the Regions and, of course, the European Parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme.	40.936460161674475
Indeed, I am forced to observe that this was not the case when the Commission drew up its communication, published on 13 October last year.	40.99229619878525
Even though I approve of the general guidelines of INTERREG III, I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme, financed by the ERDF, and the other external cooperation funds, including in particular the European Development Fund, intended for ACP countries.	63.560082858501865
In this connection, I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the EDF to the list of these funds.	25.146160459597468
The most remote regions, particularly the four French overseas departments, must be able to coordinate INTERREG III and the EDF in order to fund, in turn, cooperation projects with their ACP neighbours in their respective geographical areas.	73.34953100880709
Furthermore, I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication.	37.300665328338056
It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III, just like all the other regions in the Union, especially now that the REGIS programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped.	69.97032290790538
Finally, in conclusion, I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand C, for interregional cooperation, even though the added value this offers the Community is undeniable.	58.97629378432753
Mr President, my starting point is the EQUAL report and equality between men and women, although I must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue, which has a feeling of déjà vu about it when you are my age, in any case.	41.70582837464574
Unfortunately, it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality.	27.523944199685094
A breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas, however.	53.865207362351946
For me, equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a marriage work the whole time and hand the children over to a nanny, alias an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job.	114.79723524458149
If that is the case, we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times.	78.81727406711667
No, equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life.	152.49816120453025
Unfortunately, developments are not moving in that direction.	71.19895448817515
On the contrary.	24.29739466535206
I think, therefore, that paragraph 7 contains something very central, i.e. that EQUAL will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies.	108.10341363214556
One can only hope that it succeeds.	28.674262591104
I should just like to say, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, that if I am not here when the Commission responds - not that I have asked any specific questions, but I should nonetheless hope that the Commission has been paying attention - then that is because the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is meeting to discuss women in the decision-making process at the same time as the present debate is going on.	32.67826152161287
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those who work on rural areas know that, of the programmes which the European Union has managed, the LEADER programme, both LEADER I and LEADER II, is one of its success stories, and I hope that the same will be true of LEADER+.	47.71848147580592
One of the reasons why it has been so successful is that the basic concept of the LEADER programmes aroused substantial interest in activities amongst the population concerned.	61.891916156872256
I am glad that LEADER+ is to remain true to this underlying concept.	83.38389943105717
There is a problem, however, which we need to address together.	28.425075076075817
Because LEADER is a kind of workshop with a bottom-up approach, a huge number of ideas have come to fruition in recent years through LEADER I and II which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once were.	83.9260797969472
And because of the programme' s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be dropped from LEADER.	106.97268980716797
That is why, where the good LEADER projects are concerned, we need to ensure that those which have proved to be outstanding are not suddenly discontinued; instead the ideas which have proved to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transferred into the standard programmes as a reliable, positive component of our support to rural areas.	69.4072071269392
Of course this is also the basic idea.	46.186888587321526
It is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER, with the participants on the ground, with the local organisations on the ground, with many non-governmental organisations, with the churches, with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities.	67.84845214883931
Here we must ensure that the good schemes, those which are really excellent, are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work.	112.72747743466189
My request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted.	73.91237627231268
There should be no attempt to have one or other organisation, which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known, pushed a little on to the sidelines, say because of official local or regional policy.	87.12881678226971
Have faith in the successful results which LEADER has had so far.	149.0899035218211
At the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic.	37.328377847364706
And then when the work and the action start something emerges which the official policy, including ourselves at this level, could never have imagined would suddenly have developed so well.	187.35228877338935
That was the charm of LEADER, and that should please not be lost!	70.61574735727069
Mr President, I welcome the EQUAL initiative and the report which highlights the need to distinguish between actions to combat discrimination against women and actions to combat discrimination against minority groups.	41.393447557238794
Women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender.	152.60443744931484
This is why specific action for women is needed, as well as mainstreaming.	58.192055181911165
The report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed.	72.93216776115666
The involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ingredient of the EQUAL initiative and the projects.	52.42475784740977
The development partnerships within the thematic fields, which are referred to in Amendment No. 22, would enable even the smaller organisations to play a part in the EQUAL initiative.	79.0549307434576
My group will be supporting Amendment No. 22.	32.147816856791344
Mr President, the report under discussion in the House today is doubtless of great importance.	34.91772184806368
In addition to the objectives it is working towards, the strong point of the Community initiative INTERREG for the 2000-2006 programming period lies in its added value from the viewpoint of what is now the imminent enlargement of the European Union to include new Eastern European and Mediterranean countries.	58.75166159659904
In my opinion, it is precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the European Union should strive to reduce disparities between regions and put an end to the isolation of border areas.	27.945627677177075
Indeed, these areas - and it is right to stress this - have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the Union.	45.67756924711587
It is precisely with this in mind that I tabled some amendments which I consider to be of the utmost importance, and that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has subsequently taken up.	26.13277489040205
They call for the areas eligible for cross-border cooperation to be extended to all regions of the Adriatic, as well as to the Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta - an applicant country - which, inexplicably, are not currently included in strand A, Annex 1.	60.807563212489804
I am confident that Commissioner Barnier and the President of the European Commission will duly consider Parliament' s position on the matter, in accordance with the Code of Conduct.	30.646895433802094
There are fundamental advantages for the whole of Europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions.	53.42029128909611
Finally, it is to be hoped that greater coordination will be sought between the INTERREG initiative and the existing Community programmes, which are significant for external policy, as a vector for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programmes.	65.64208147371791
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, LEADER I was an outright success due, in particular, to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operators.	50.65314810336947
It is, I think, regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of LEADER II, regarding the quality of the projects, the quantity of appropriations spent and, most especially, the demotivation of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered.	65.88586377358912
I am pleased to see, however, that under LEADER+, new resources have been allocated to helping rural territories to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development.	67.39046763619133
I feel it is important to put special emphasis on trying out new ways to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment, in order to promote employment.	48.39375078587546
The time is now right, I think, to consider including the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation.	103.95683186076737
It is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for LEADER II.	34.7804047332796
Nonetheless, if the opportunity for Member States to determine the areas, within the scope of this initiative, remains available, then the Commission will have to ensure a certain focusing of resources and prioritise projects in the less prosperous areas.	66.16493188839078
There must, of course, be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups.	115.18912647047209
I also feel there are grounds for ensuring, in particular, that the financial channels of States or local authorities are not behind the delays in payment which may have caused some LAGs to become bankrupt under LEADER II.	76.15155694539958
Mr President, as a Member from one of the outermost regions, I must point out that this is a very special afternoon as far as regional policy is concerned, because of the debate on two Community initiatives, URBAN and INTERREG.	48.73204409975673
I would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed, firstly, in the case of URBAN, at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various European cities, and, in the case of INTERREG, at facilitating cohesion and recognising the diversity and potential of the regions of the European Union, particularly by including the outermost regions in strands B and C.	51.74813966761769
Like the rapporteur, we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand IIIA.	24.34166412117726
With regard to INTERREG, we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a European monitoring centre concerned with cooperation.	35.63127734598488
I would like to thank the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Decourrière, for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments.	38.84437594421543
I hope that the Commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making.	20.425033950502666
Mr President, with regard to the various initiatives which we are analysing this afternoon, I would like to concentrate strictly on one of them, that is, the URBAN programme.	31.24431097442196
It is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the European Parliament insisted that this initiative should be maintained.	22.99254933124387
The Commission proposed removing it and other initiatives, but Parliament' s proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time led to the URBAN initiative being retained.	73.32669537861501
I believe that we should be pleased about this.	8.981754106686616
But what were the Commission' s arguments, from Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu in particular, for eliminating the URBAN programme?	59.24287317053986
Its argument was one of priority.	212.31354643384228
The urban question is so important that we cannot tighten our belts and undervalue it with a programme which has such a small budget.	44.397867231278525
Today the programme is in place and therefore I believe we have achieved something important, that distinguishing mark of the European Union called the URBAN programme.	66.84103830910064
However, I would like to address Commissioner Barnier and support the argument of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and the Director-General, because I think they were absolutely right.	36.51633605685182
The urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds.	50.65630020750887
The amount of budget required by our cities - where 80% of the European population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in Europe, I believe, clearly indicates that the European dimension should be taken into account and that this URBAN programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail, not to prioritise and, therefore, not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities, by means of European funds.	78.33427753825474
Therefore, I do not believe I need to restate the number of factors which demand this investment in urban areas, factors which are on the agenda, and I would like to say to the Commissioner that we hope he will be sensitive in this respect.	35.94471759335319
In welcoming the cross-sectoral approach embodied in the new EQUAL initiative, it is crucial that the programme addresses the distinct forms of discrimination which militate against disabled people in particular: physical barriers in the workplace affecting those with limited mobility, visual information systems which exclude blind workers, working systems which effectively close the door on people with learning difficulties or with mental health problems.	166.8373946454959
Organisations of disabled people and disabled people' s non-disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision-making.	134.15769058399542
That is why this Parliament has put forward paragraphs 10 and 15 of the resolution, to ensure that Member States cannot ignore any one target group.	59.69388484471156
Disabled people have too often been left off the list.	81.75184928838326
Because disabled people do not form one homogenous group - for example many deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority denied respect for their own language and culture - it is necessary as stated in paragraph 9 to enable some partnerships to be defined which are specific to a particular disability or other group.	122.48734482933601
EQUAL remains crucial also to regions like my own, in the east of England, outside the principal funds of Objective I. We have had an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response.	186.00549113825724
Former ADAPT projects range from the CORE project, which has developed new supply chains for the car industry in Bedfordshire, to projects to raise standards in small businesses in Hertfordshire in Essex.	170.99290535634884
We have seen the NOW project helping 70 women to return to work in Suffolk, many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the European Parliament in Brussels.	120.92261031910661
EQUAL remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower-skilled jobs are being shed, which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market.	61.296085359121605
Finally, a word on INTERREG.	173.7588799119127
It really is quite nonsensical that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional links.	116.52593439735045
During this period the ports of Great Yarmouth and Harwich on the Essex-Suffolk-Norfolk coast have launched significant new transportation and economic links with partners in the Netherlands.	73.15281167275373
I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2, which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas, particularly on maritime borders.	74.9917452487142
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the information of the House, Mr President, I should like to make a clarification.	13.002667808677478
Chancellor Schüssel' s government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government led by Chancellor Klima.	156.03462148021833
There is no change in refugee policy in Austria!	41.99843159574648
Rural areas make up over 80% of the EU' s territory and 25% of the population live in them.	56.80380047940393
As a farmer and Member of Parliament, I have always endeavoured not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural areas as a whole.	60.09176911665232
I attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because I am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone; I refer, in short, to the multifunctionality of rural areas.	72.5135832205678
I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER+ programme because of its comprehensive nature.	45.55784510876712
In the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the EU.	33.67751635869305
This across-the-board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way.	77.91102381806209
In the future, funding will no longer come from three funds but from the EAGGF Guidance section alone.	102.32644112481563
It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the EAGGF is supposed to be an effective financial instrument.	28.049539526109136
Greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness, because the money should not be squandered recklessly.	45.541294676620865
In addition, I should particularly like to emphasise the point which offers an approach towards creating an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy.	49.006292094136306
There is great potential for future job creation in rural areas here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospects to people living in the countryside.	49.98050426436582
That is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers.	63.46235476694287
LEADER+ should supplement already existing programmes, avoid overlaps and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which is as comprehensive as possible.	82.06269905639654
In this way, LEADER+ can, together with the programmes under Regulation (EC) No 1257/99, consolidate the second pillar of the CAP even more effectively and produce the best possible benefits for the whole of the countryside.	71.95449305753219
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not always proud of the fuss that goes on here in Parliament, but the URBAN programme is one of the best examples of our work: it was created following an initiative in Parliament.	33.59602091256664
The Commission would have abolished URBAN, but this time Parliament drew the longer straw.	94.09176367931032
It is good that URBAN is to continue, as it has had good results at local level.	44.54001109107042
The problems in Europe' s urban areas are getting worse; fortunately, we now have consensus with the Commission.	91.66720069128395
The majority of the population of Europe live in cities, and their problems are among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matters in themselves.	55.10059522026909
There is an immense risk of exclusion.	54.884286597822616
In many cities in France and England there are now slums, breeding grounds for many sorts of problems.	50.17773744729703
None of us wants South American type favelas in Europe.	118.04897342771106
We have to act now, before it is too late.	29.530493925979176
Our cities are also of decisive importance for Europe' s economy.	43.98493080626194
We always come back to the same basic problem in Europe: our economy does not support the individual sufficiently, nor is it sufficiently dynamic.	91.15643138441547
The economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellow-citizens and our environment.	22.339824235430452
This is not policy; it is life' s simple logic.	160.24479179238372
It is good that spending has become focused, as otherwise the buckshot gets scattered to the four winds.	47.614234542884326
Now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middle-size towns and cities, as they do not have enough resources.	45.31019734133298
In this way we will also be able to speed up matters in surrounding rural areas; it is often forgotten that urban and rural problems in fact go hand in hand.	69.8421541286237
The basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship, as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally.	175.5156034033671
Granting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two feet is like carrying water to fill up a dry well: there will be enough to drink for a while, but tomorrow the well will be dry again.	198.25387315872308
Mr President, with the implementation of INTERREG III, European cooperation policy is entering a new phase.	59.79487598800693
Our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones.	105.56587191492375
In the context of globalisation and cultural openness which characterise the current situation, the European Union needs instruments that will allow it to strengthen its links and communication channels with neighbouring regions, particularly in Eastern and Southern Europe.	70.08311883875128
The Union' s borders must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development, but - on the contrary - an opportunity, a bridge to more fruitful cooperation.	55.69826287873471
By means of amendments adopted in committee, Parliament has tried to supplement the Commission' s work, by including new elements in the list of areas targeted for aid, and in particular external border areas and maritime border areas in Southern Europe.	96.78796327597088
In its draft guidelines, the Commission acknowledges that these borders require greater attention than they did in the past.	86.47283203799772
This is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the Mediterranean countries.	37.234940510407576
As President Prodi too mentioned when outlining the strategic objectives for the period 2000-2005, boosting the Barcelona process is a priority for the Union, and the INTERREG III initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective.	34.63413855286093
In congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work, we can but hope that the Commission will duly take into consideration the proposals Parliament has put forward, in accordance with the commitments made under the Code of Conduct on the implementation of structural policies, and that it will confirm, with fitting amendments, the transformation of this Community initiative from a mere instrument for internal redistribution to an opportunity to boost and enhance relations with neighbouring countries.	49.35456225851801
Mr President, from this year until the year 2006 around EUR 200 billion is available for the Structural Funds, but only 5¾ % is set aside for the Community initiatives, INTERREG, LEADER, URBAN and EQUAL.	100.40154438062898
That is a reduction of 3¾ % compared with the previous CIs.	25.615940811815367
No more than EUR 2.8 billion is provided for EQUAL, as Mrs Stenzel' s balanced report makes clear.	82.34095748576661
This makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more astonishing.	115.4346343552384
How are priorities supposed to be set here?	122.18039498224654
There is agreement on the principle that marginalisation, discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced.	41.08516964969994
Transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs.	67.97399943745393
I have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the TAOs. Criticism of the previous Commission' s work was particularly severe, legitimately so, with regard to these Technical Assistance Offices.	53.6381956281016
Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was, after all, in overall charge of analysing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to LEONARDO.	75.22227858924197
The Commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under EQUAL either.	59.67097551067038
It can only approve Member States' proposals if they fulfil all the criteria: firstly, integration through sectoral and geographical development partnerships, whereby the employment policy guidelines need to be taken into account; secondly, the systematic involvement of the operators concerned - the local, regional and national authorities, training institutions, universities, NGOs, the two sides of industry and the private sector - with the aim of creating a durable partnership, and thirdly, methods and models of indisputably innovative character.	135.21499586351732
The Commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work, of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices.	68.92604608275087
Only then will it be possible for the desired multiplier effect to be achieved.	30.031646843304575
Mr President, I want to refer to the Commission proposals on the budget line to promote the CAP.	25.677992893079853
On 26 October 1999 the European Commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the CAP.	48.69655051465061
This proposal will remove the current budget line B2-5122 and create a new budget heading B1-382.	55.352744059843104
Actions which promote understanding between young farmers and the EU and also create stronger links with EU candidate countries and the outside world are important.	132.345324381981
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme.	43.94085580576894
Given the need to encourage young farmers to continue in farming it is vitally important that they are well-informed about developments in the common agricultural policy.	48.53866499818461
Informing and training young farmers at European level is vitally important.	65.13603369665353
I would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst European young farmers.	48.403143604300915
Regarding information and training, in the past this budget line has been allocated for information, communication and training.	91.81668062496372
But the Commission is now proposing that training should no longer be included.	30.714198996376645
I feel that training should be included where it provides relevant information at European level about the CAP.	86.40309316128058
Such European training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the CAP to make sound business decisions for the future.	77.42778411309027
Therefore I am putting forward three amendments.	58.73900019224614
I would urge Parliament to support them.	21.561575919849002
Mr President, I am taking the floor to express my opinion, drawn from my experience of municipal administration, that the URBAN projects should, or rather must, have a threefold purpose: firstly, to promote the restoration of infrastructure and historic, old and perhaps dilapidated areas of cities.	95.26782383839966
Secondly, to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres, within these old quarters of our cities.	159.44699388019248
There is little point in having streets which are now wonderfully lit, with new pavements, with newly paved road surfaces, all whitewashed and beautiful, if we are not able to fill them with activity and, therefore, employment.	50.09676342618769
I would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators, but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment, or to put it another way, projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs.	51.56409287821922
Thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the projects should principally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families, because man is not made for the law, but rather law is made for man.	118.76359200148616
These areas of our cities are often home to single-parent families, elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity, and families facing difficulties; sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstream society.	156.37434333320473
These people live in areas which should benefit from these projects.	55.89330762759312
If we have success in this threefold sense, I believe that these families, these people, these European citizens, will believe more in Europe, and this seems to me to be very important because, ultimately, the cities will increasingly come to play a leading role in European life.	72.96357794418977
. (FR) Mr President, before my friends and fellow Commissioners, Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou, in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four Community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest, I would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of URBAN and INTERREG, which many of you have brought up and discussed.	67.41328683688869
Straight away I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteurs from the committees, from all the committees, but also to the speakers for the groups and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speeches and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiatives.	55.796777557767854
This is particularly true of what Mrs McCarthy said about URBAN. I should like to thank her not only for her work and for the report which she presented but also - and I do not see why I in turn should not say so too - for all we owe her, for all you owe her as far as this is initiative, as well as, more generally, all we owe Parliament.	68.85006777525354
I am mindful of the fact that it was in fact the European Parliament which made the political decision and supported the continuation of this initiative for the regeneration of urban areas in difficulties, in favour of sustainable urban development, involving at the same time this integrated approach, which we value, to handle the economic, social and environmental aspects simultaneously.	64.00192336770967
Some other points of agreement highlighted in Mrs McCarthy' s report, the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention, the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and, finally, the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programmes, on the basis of a real partnership.	67.50412591675581
Having mentioned the fundamental points of agreement between the Commission' s proposals and Parliament and, having stressed my great interest in hearing the various contributions, I should like to answer a few of the criticisms and a few of the suggestions which have been made, with apologies if I cannot attribute each of the questions to the speakers by name.	65.00267760577418
I think however that you will all recognise your own comments.	45.56301563642417
Firstly on the subject of the URBAN programme and the maximum threshold of fifty towns, which a number of you termed arbitrary.	77.45171225774784
I can understand your concern.	48.05458631800287
I have therefore asked my services to be willing to consider a reasonable increase in the number of towns eligible under the URBAN programme conditional upon certain guarantees, firstly on concentration - I am thinking particularly of the target areas which must have a minimum of 20 000 or, in exceptional cases, 10 000 inhabitants - and also upon the critical mass of funding: we must keep to EUR 500 per inhabitant so that the European Union action may be both effective and clear, and so that it does not resemble a sort of scattering of resources which would have no real impact either for citizens or for municipalities.	76.52028624218127
That is my initial response to the threshold question.	85.91919723919395
Regarding a second matter, now, relating to the additional criteria, which should be taken into consideration in selecting disadvantaged areas. Here, too, I am willing to demonstrate greater flexibility and to consider other relevant criteria in addition to the Community criteria given in point 11 of the guidance project.	109.44406419588773
Third point: specific measures in favour of some social groups - some speakers mentioned them - women, but also immigrants and refugees, must be envisaged.	243.35508159283486
This concern, ladies and gentlemen, lies at the very heart of our URBAN initiative, and I am willing to rewrite the text, if necessary, in order to make this message clearer yet.	48.7442800474596
Regarding URBAN, I should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention, first of all, the selection procedure.	97.31882451333833
Some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic, more transparent, and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding.	68.80720478960454
Ladies and gentlemen, on this point we must make it clear: in the context of subsidiarity, the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for URBAN is primarily the responsibility of the Member States.	37.37759043675052
As far as the Commission is concerned, it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload, but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes, indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did.	50.97590612604749
A second observation, the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes.	62.22491140696146
I have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme.	70.39681399866949
This cannot, however, be grounds for an extension of the original time limit.	66.99014358478557
Let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months.	24.669898366347127
This time limit, which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs, should normally be adequate, I feel, for drawing up a programme, which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage.	95.32026129755788
With regard to URBAN, I should like to conclude with a final observation.	32.529882802446856
One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the URBAN initiative.	61.229422765768284
I agree completely.	123.49489010086032
I myself expressed my concern at the meeting of Ministers for regional and urban planning, a concern to which I devote myself, that in the DOCUPs and the CSFs in the planning which we are currently starting to negotiate, my concern, as I said, that, apart from the URBAN initiative, urban issues should be addressed in all the Objective 1 and Objective 2 programmes, and I believe I can express both our awareness of such issues and also our commitment to include them, beyond the scope of URBAN, in all structural fund programming.	83.67553492906146
But, as for the future, since we must look ahead, I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN is going to be implemented in practical terms, and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn, because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be, for future financial perspectives, a new European regional planning policy.	72.7609543564203
I am not forgetting, and we cannot forget, that 80% of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important.	42.80399221799278
Let me repeat what I have said, we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming.	44.33680046600059
I should now, Mr President, like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur, Francis Decourrière, in the same way that I thanked Arlene McCarthy, for the quality and relevance of his work.	55.04710104348817
He stressed a number of points, with which we may indicate our agreement, as many of you did too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation, with its three strands, cross-border, transnational, interregional; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG, its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds, and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations; the importance of common structures and what, in discussing another debate which begins today, the Intergovernmental Conference, I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen, and here, with INTERREG, thanks to INTERREG, is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners.	122.65496931420594
Having made these general observations, I should like to focus on your main comments with regard to INTERREG.	72.68251628929283
The first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative.	32.3419018017282
You comment that these guidelines were adopted at too late a date, stressing, particularly your rapporteur, the risk that the previous programmes will be interrupted.	204.82714797892433
It is true, I admit it, and you are well aware of the reasons, ladies and gentlemen.	35.858342793997785
There is a delay in adopting the INTERREG guidelines in March or April 2000.	55.09928153536749
I accept this; I take note of it as you do.	75.13180025262432
I note, however, that the Member States and the regions are already actively preparing the programmes for INTERREG III and indeed the guidance project was distributed over three months ago now.	83.92996173684138
I also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 January, if the programme is presented before 30 April.	78.06628319881288
So much for the first comment.	55.07768904501448
As to the second comment: regarding the non-comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand B, I wish to inform you, to confirm, that I have asked the Commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects, particularly in favour of small- and medium-sized businesses and of cultural heritage, in the list of schemes eligible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one.	55.93439346200694
Third point: interregional cooperation, the importance of strand C. The Commission shares the observations made by this House regarding the importance of strand C, interregional cooperation.	98.62631946218252
As your rapporteur has requested, I shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand.	60.39756626948519
Fourth observation: the European Observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office.	120.55207688446016
As you requested, I have decided to remove all references to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the Commission on the service outsourcing systems.	82.65653027994907
But, ladies and gentlemen, if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a TAO at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials' jobs needed to do this work, because somebody will have to do it and I cannot keep redeploying the same staff indefinitely, at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre-accession structural instrument (ISPA) and in order to ensure that, the Community appropriations for which I am responsible, often in partnership or on terms of coresponsibility with Member States, are monitored better, with discipline and transparency.	77.50871907813206
Now to the implementation of INTERREG, a subject mentioned by many of you, and the potential eligibility under strand A, 'cross-border cooperation' , of schemes in the Adriatic, on behalf of Sicily or for the most remote regions, the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, understands your concerns and takes note of your requests on these various points.	89.86158226747881
I therefore intend to amend the guidelines in order to incorporate a specific priority into the transnational strand B: 'integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions' , so as to cover, in what I think is an appropriate fashion the various opportunities for cooperation between these regions.	76.75570149500662
In addition to this one overture there is a second which we have already suggested to the Member States: greater financial flexibility between strand A and strand B. Thanks to these two overtures, especially the first, I can say that the Commission is willing to examine the case of Italian regions and regions of third countries around the Adriatic in order to promote the most appropriate cooperation under INTERREG, and with other instruments too, as soon as they become available.	66.9179585000881
I have decided, in the end, that the most remote regions, to which I attach particular importance, will be given special priority in the context of the transnational strand of INTERREG, with a cooperation strategy which will aim at improving their links with their neighbours and other Member State regions.	82.11969291118213
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the EDF, particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.	43.15726868354479
All this should make it possible for us, apart from the Objective 1 appropriations and also with them, to confirm the role of 'active frontier' of the Union.	49.59719304729935
I adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote regions of the Union are actually active frontiers of the Union, even if, or precisely because, they are remote and located in other regions of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear.	79.31100107444715
Another point: the coordination between INTERREG, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA.	226.06167006451213
It is true, once again, and I accept this objectively, that there are still real legal problems.	53.03570603205394
I do not want to minimise these, but progress is being made as far as strand A cooperation with candidate countries is concerned, even if the problems related to the management procedures and to the scale of the projects still remain.	79.5806879755707
The Commission must continue along these lines.	41.36086319112275
I am making a personal commitment to do so.	22.5542689480807
An initial joint PHARE/CIP committee is to meet in February to assess this coordination, and let me confirm my attentiveness and availability with regard to this, together with my colleagues and fellow Commissioners Verheugen, Patten and Poul Nielson.	101.49290740981266
Finally, on the subject of technical assistance, on which your rapporteur and several of you commented. It goes without saying that the Commission will adhere to the terms of Article 23 of the general regulations regarding technical assistance, if it is indeed assistance intended to be an instrument useful to structural policy in general.	70.20958715809299
According to the general regulations, however, any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a Community initiative must be proposed under Article 20, and not Article 23.	133.68749527206495
This means that the ceiling of 0.25% mentioned in Article 23 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance.	54.97063980869214
I attach great importance, ladies and gentlemen, in a spirit of discipline and transparency, to our nonetheless retaining some financial strands for matters relating to the exchange of experience and information, and not to propaganda, and to the implementation of networks ensuring good communication of best practice within the Union.	138.66774467992664
My conclusion regarding INTERREG, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is that these Community initiatives for which I am responsible fulfil a real need and everything that has been said is proof of this. They also foreshadow a real European regional planning policy within our enlarged Union.	90.60624430151472
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to this, just as you yourselves do.	94.21334050141644
I remain at your service in order, when the time comes, to present the report of previous planning which you request, but also to keep you informed regularly as to the implementation of these initiatives in the course of the new planning.	98.58381468462989
Repeating my thanks to each and every one of you, and also particularly to Arlene McCarthy and Francis Decourrière, I should like to point out that these two initiatives lie within a financial framework with which you are familiar: only EUR 700 million for URBAN, but this is better than nothing; EUR 4 billion 800 millions for INTERREG.	100.45834041091524
So we are working within this framework and not outside it.	71.50189066460142
On the subject of these two initiatives, then, with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives, let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and its committees.	77.27733198334093
Everything that I have just said, ladies and gentlemen, demonstrates that the Commission is resolved to taken the views of Parliament into account.	54.69479716112564
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to thank Mr Procacci for his report.	8.176781149228686
However, I should also like to extend thanks to the various committees involved and Parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have given the LEADER+ initiative.	41.52520025405658
This initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original ideas, ideas which it is then intended should at a later stage be incorporated in the general programmes as models.	133.4783770537093
I am also pleased that Parliament essentially supports the Commission' s view that LEADER+ should be applied in all rural areas, that overriding priorities should be introduced and that, above all, active cooperation and networking between rural areas should be encouraged.	37.308883524117476
In addition, I note that Parliament shares the Commission' s view that the preferred form for implementing LEADER+ is the use of global grants.	57.53167922513558
Turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today, I can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in LEADER+.	61.47003521261202
The various groups, be they environmental organisations or groups concerned with employment, have the possibility of taking part in drafting the Commission directives.	215.4202005382282
And there will not be less funds available than in the current period either; there will be more.	94.52121534446368
I should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new.	22.488910643436224
There was also an observatory under LEADER I and LEADER II.	110.89833409176013
It has one purpose only and that is precisely to maintain active networking between the individual LEADER groups.	150.22849577124862
The cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2% of the LEADER budget.	58.185534735705545
As far as the possibility of having projects containing training initiatives is concerned, I might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integrated into the new rural development policy, which means, in our view, that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of LEADER.	48.15523914624727
I now come to the content of the report.	19.82745237516469
In point 14, Parliament calls on the Commission to submit an evaluation report on LEADER II immediately.	100.40106562989939
I should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because, as you know, it is still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 2001 - for LEADER II funds to be disbursed.	33.39007898829598
We therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme' s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation.	64.99130318207304
We will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it.	89.59284818546703
In point 18, Parliament suggests publishing a compendium of examples of successful initiatives.	154.15816579526063
In response I can only say that this already exists.	35.98969477475252
It has already been compiled by the Commission and I can make a copy available to any Member of this House who is interested.	27.17854858334398
In point 21, Parliament stresses that the guidelines in LEADER+ now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start.	96.2478808879315
I can only fully share your concern.	40.2995700165687
As soon as the opinion is adopted here in Parliament, the guidelines for LEADER+ will again be presented to the STAR Committee so that the Member States can confirm the provisional agreement which they gave on 14 November.	54.70301313931412
I assume that the Commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guidelines in March or April.	28.26140080297217
And as soon as these are published in the Official Journal the remaining months - in fact six months - can be used to submit LEADER+ programmes.	111.56945291625443
I believe that it is important to point out one thing: expenditure effected under LEADER+ is eligible from the time that the Commission programme starts running.	67.59740813483981
For all programmes submitted before 30 April of this year it will be possible to backdate the beginning of the period of eligibility to 1 January.	49.795299846482834
Finally, under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines.	106.55925036187288
Having given them thorough consideration, I can tell you that the proposals made under paragraphs 2, 4, 5 and 7 are acceptable to the Commission and are adopted.	60.264657627443306
The proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under LEADER+ is a maximum of 5 months.	99.30718889714899
The amendment proposed under paragraph 1 has, in our view, been overtaken by events because, following consultations with the representatives of the Member States in the STAR Committee, this point has already been reworded along the lines proposed by Parliament.	48.628168275528985
That therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3.	154.08298509993836
The Commission can only endorse this request because of course it corresponds precisely to what the Commission itself had originally proposed.	55.15285271950873
I must add, however, that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the Member States.	70.69138195004219
An amendment was therefore made in the committee, but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament' s concern in the revised version and table the guidelines in that form.	64.57224605605572
It will also continue to fight for Member States' acceptance of this.	31.59035999894087
I will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled.	54.97700970434152
Here there are only three which the Commission cannot accept, Amendments Nos 3, 12 and 13.	43.10461861238742
It can accept all of the others either in full or in essence.	107.8580161284725
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the EQUAL initiative in the European Parliament just at this time.	21.647709962763773
Recently, because of political developments in Austria, there is growing unease within Europe. Political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue.	139.34828306143731
It is worth stressing that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policies.	49.17136075761886
We need specific proposals, both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies.	64.94672348231029
So I will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committees to appoint their rapporteurs so that we can move ahead with the anti-discrimination package as soon as possible.	62.64498290444756
I now come to the EQUAL initiative, which is, of course, based on Article 13.	25.598736174965033
The EQUAL initiative relates to all forms of discrimination within the meaning of Article 13, namely the fight against discrimination based on race, gender, age, and special needs.	55.324060949522114
I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs Stenzel, because her effort to reach agreement on the EQUAL initiative has proved exceptionally difficult and complex, both because some of the committees involved view the issue in a different light and because it is a very sensitive political issue.	43.63477172501434
The first comment, which has been made by many others too, is whether women should be mentioned separately.	41.439610699831796
I agree that Article 13 contains something we have expressed our disagreement about, but that is how the Treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination, discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place.	112.60112207022357
So on the basis of the Treaty as it stands today, the EQUAL initiative is structured in that way.	33.226108011073684
I would like to remind you, however, that there is a special axis for the employment strategy which relates to women and that a special programme is being prepared, the fifth programme for equality between men and women.	26.779387417171623
I have classified the issues raised by the honourable Members into four groups.	65.04295348214893
Firstly, the enlargement of the thematic areas.	58.51555084477275
As in employment strategy, there are four thematic areas: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities, and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament' s proposals.	51.6441017134135
To answer the concern whether there is a risk that a country might concentrate all the funds on one of the categories suffering discrimination, I will say that the initiative states clearly that the Member States must submit one thematic category for each group that is suffering discrimination.	120.60830906343016
The second subject is flexibility and simplification.	47.76130084667373
I agree with Mr Leinen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand.	30.80302136777288
That is why the services are already trying to revise the text, simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp.	85.12261534843122
As regards the subject of flexibility, we propose development partnerships and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kinds of groups would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace, and at the thematic level where, for example, cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector.	69.32699586786603
This would allow Member States great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs.	80.36337460969943
Of course, a prerequisite for that is cooperation between the Member States, and a network which will assist the exchange of experience.	33.18812132274652
Finally, I would like to mention technical assistance.	30.380760746596753
We are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available.	38.84673762734028
First, funding for preparation; second, implementation; third, mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience, and fourth, technical assistance.	322.2902747471873
Since there has been great involvement and concern about how technical assistance is to be provided, we must say that external offices will be used.	45.6140898043497
As Mr Barnier too pointed out, it is impossible for all the work previously done by external collaborators to be done now by the Commission' s staff.	46.698346331421284
The aim at national and European level is to establish large action groups by tender, with a full description of the project for which external assistance is to be requested. We would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitored and appraised.	77.60527922189986
I want to stress that it is extremely important to promote this specific initiative as quickly as possible, both for reasons of political timing and because we believe that it is important that it should begin as planned, in other words, we must be absolutely ready by the end of 2000.	33.477938483511984
Thank you, Commissioner.	17.829151062792345
I shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the Bureau and to the appropriate committees.	54.74666980078831
The debate is closed.	3.7754896132534173
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.	5.950860542712835
(The sitting was closed at 8.40 p.m.)	7.205806307620132
Approval of the Minutes of the two previous sittings	54.53923989529998
The Minutes of the sittings of Thursday 3 February and Monday 14 February have been distributed.	44.275311000995416
The Minutes of 3 February were originally distributed in Brussels so perhaps this is why some Members did not receive them.	50.949272388218986
Are there any comments?	12.89232023557679
(The Minutes were approved)	22.452217819019545
Madam President, my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part-session on Monday afternoons at 5.00 p.m.	31.265585749480707
Yesterday it was impossible for myself and many MEPs to be here, because the 2.15 p.m. Air France flight, which normally brings us here, was cancelled, with no explanation from the airline, and we therefore arrived very late.	115.59398515342741
If Air France insists on boycotting the European Parliament, we should take measures to prevent this occurring again.	51.175627601873586
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega.	14.003726502929975
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation.	37.41904302499435
Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government?	73.44668806863321
This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly.	106.82700665260592
Madam President, I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday.	33.83212997966251
I feel that the French authorities - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union.	30.886459337608855
Absolutely, Mr Napolitano. Thank you.	265.12366582287603
Madam President, off the subject of aeroplane delays, I wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Caroline Lucas, who is a British Member.	39.72824467361166
She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow.	112.34326471464429
Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent, she was still held in custody all day.	99.55116849272959
I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receives an apology. I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague, Mrs Hautala.	34.83514373921367
Thank you, Mr Lannoye.	14.221496226011018
I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative.	72.68577418841093
Madam President, I should like to make a request in connection with today' s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report.	26.168169608642934
I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point.	36.66622359471782
I am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL.	72.52357671153891
We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning.	72.63383849416064
Madam President, to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye made: Mrs Lucas was arrested just outside Glasgow for protesting against the Trident base at Faslane.	96.60740029729858
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest.	36.208519396715886
I have, however, no sympathy for Mrs Lucas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity.	106.81630998005778
I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane.	20.092841117857105
I did not hide behind any immunity.	92.41259112951688
I took the punishment that came to me.	45.985493445035836
Mrs Lucas should do the same.	92.63207851043312
Madam President, I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow.	30.773497906723744
In fact, this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee, and, given that it is a major Commission proposal, which refers to the agreements we reached last year, I consider it admissible.	49.5041829907487
We agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups, so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible.	53.99775030726451
Does anyone want to speak against Mrs Stenzel' s request, as supported by Mrs Ghilardotti?	56.72000358877283
If not, then we will proceed to the vote.	32.163701907585214
(Parliament approved the request)	105.02702731465166
Madam President, under Rule 29(4) you should be kept informed by political groups of any Members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group.	115.7236989595814
Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People's Party or does the Austrian People's Party continue to sit in that political group?	61.20817142879353
Mr Corbett, I have not received any notification.	67.78694527946949
Madam President, I am amazed at Mr Corbett' s reaction.	38.316950943937805
He should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here.	226.18156944962035
We are solidly with our Austrian friends who have proven to be good Europeans in the past.	34.83701249206853
They have our full support.	31.747961600813618
(Applause)	42.81948661699828
Agenda	634.2024716887657
With regard to the agenda for Thursday, following a request made yesterday in plenary, I propose extending the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance by half an hour to 6.00 p.m. when the vote will take place.	51.40547636861842
(Parliament gave its assent)	57.786768702382076
Commission's strategic objectives and legislative programme	115.39143327563747
The next item is the joint debate on the Commission statements on its strategic objectives for the coming five years and the annual legislative programme for 2000.	17.997065577980823
I therefore immediately give the floor to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.	22.765593507707205
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a five-year programme is an extremely important undertaking, and this is why I preferred that you be given the unabridged text of the speech, which is available in four languages.	36.18558935391046
To respect my speaking time, I will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme: a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century, when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective, a Europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation.	60.14962069486806
Let us remember that for half a century, Europe has provided us with peace, security and freedom and a united Europe has also contributed to giving us a period of unprecedented prosperity.	76.57474528411117
We are now seeing the beginning of a strong recovery, which it appears may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we are prudent with our policies.	71.56898651525546
This recovery is the logical consequence of the efforts we have made, but it comes at a price: it follows the restructuring of public accounts in European countries, which have kept inflation under control with a policy wisely intended to control costs and increase productivity in a Europe that has begun a vigorous restructuring of its own industries, banks and public services, even though this process is not yet complete and still has a long way to go.	82.85920714899538
Nevertheless, despite these aspects, European citizens are disappointed and concerned: by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough; by a Europe trailing behind in technology, and seemingly falling even further behind, and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too; by the European institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times, starting with the Commission itself.	115.54780423355871
The crisis in the Commission was, in fact, a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and its citizens, and the low turnout at the European elections was a worrying indication of this.	38.35385774678048
Even stronger still, however, is the sense of insecurity, the feeling of being unprepared in a new world that is moving forwards, a world which is completely changing, where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference.	147.45423783436772
This is not the first time this has happened: Europe was once confronted with a similar transformation, an explosion of its markets, a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world.	70.85367105966515
I am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turned everything upside down.	41.132567851464515
Some countries - such as France and Spain - managed to meet the challenge, giving rise to great nation States; other countries - such as Italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium: headway in science, technology, economic progress, defence structures and military organisation, philosophy and literature.	147.78894908857856
Today, Europe is facing a similar challenge, and we know that, just as history has been unforgiving in the past, it will not be forgiving in the present.	36.992648508702565
In this context of wholesale change, and in order to prevent our nation States vanishing again, in the wake of globalisation which is creating hitherto unprecedented scales and challenges, Europe needs to be economically strong, because globalisation demands unity, because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at European level too.	106.96656895587904
But more vital still is a Europe that feels strong in the political arena.	87.43934546229268
In years past, the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions, the mainstay of European life.	56.571687129513
Today, the new frontiers of European integration are political frontiers: common foreign and security policy, justice and internal security, and - to a lesser extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based.	66.26451513204087
The Commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000-2005, a programme that was immediately sent to the European Parliament and with which you are already familiar, so I will not go into detail about it now.	42.724546595695834
Some of you may find it lacks detail, but no political structure sets out detailed five-year programmes.	141.97544843209818
This is the European Union, not the Soviet Union.	31.762058773550137
Our programme highlights the major points of reference, the major areas for action: firstly, the development of new forms of governance for Europe; secondly, extension and enlargement of the area of peace, freedom, and security; thirdly, the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy; fourthly, safeguarding and improving quality of life.	131.861421938153
These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years.	47.69998610370829
With regard to the first area - new forms of governance for Europe - you already know that the Commission has undertaken to produce a White Paper and not a full legislative text since, in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact, the Commission is first of all preparing for a debate; we will subsequently discuss the content with you; this will give rise to a policy document, and finally, a legislative document.	66.38969566508877
This is an effective, transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institutions and the citizens of Europe.	32.58574092734949
This White Paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement is forcing on us, an enlargement that is forcing us to rethink the workings of all our institutions, rethink our very policies - all our policies - and above all rethink what we must continue to do at Union level when the Member States number 25 or 30, and what will be the best thing to do at individual State level, at regional level and at local government level.	105.64906260729786
But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink: as I said a few moments ago, it is also economic and political globalisation itself.	84.21471231239153
We must govern Europe in such a way as to make us more efficient, to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved, starting with the important issue of the involvement of women.	50.313249006512365
One of the main differences in the comparison made recently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mobility or risk capital, as women' s involvement in economic life, an issue that has much more prominence in the United States than in Europe. This is a field where Europe has, nevertheless, always been in the vanguard.	90.99071299319641
We therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind, and all the institutions - Commission, Parliament, Council - will have to consider their own roles and their own policies.	90.46805243194288
We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper, although in order to finish it, we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001.	43.21324894136225
It will not be a philosophical Paper, but a practical Paper, full of focused proposals.	139.5950175316389
We - the Commission - are the first to know that we must have a total rethink, and we shall therefore do two things: we are, and will continue to be, fully committed to internal reform, and we shall rethink our policies in detail.	75.39529302521493
I have asked all the Commissioners - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activities that we can forgo.	56.97304267092506
The Commission must define what its fundamental activities are, what it must concentrate on and shed its non-essential activities, thereby freeing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co-operative relationship with individual countries, regions and local communities.	133.71745979737275
So we shall be freeing up new resources, but - I fear, and I want to state this before Parliament - the time will come when these new resources that we are already freeing up will, in turn, be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks: I am thinking of enlargement, the new sector of justice and home affairs, health issues and environmental matters.	82.36824995148231
When that time comes, when we have used up all our resources, I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources, but what I am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources, we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on.	72.54695786858593
As for internal reform, you well know how committed my Commission has been to this since day one.	371.91059455105494
I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform, if it does not become more efficient, if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors, starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past - external aid.	49.788153340326446
Providing aid rapidly, when it is needed, saves human lives; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all.	168.94502145881353
When I speak about external aid, my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans. There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems.	149.03808674775846
My thoughts also turn to Bernard Kouchner' s efforts, of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication, but I also think of new events, such as Croatia, where the situation has changed in a few weeks: the European institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only Bosnia' s problems, but more particularly Serbia' s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around Serbia.	115.71481510167659
This is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans.	35.79018427788127
We must increase our efficiency in this area. We must reopen the Danube to boats.	64.01269730326374
It is contradictory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to harness their greatest resource.	128.99143145280212
We must decontaminate the river and, in view of this, over the next few days the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem.	44.061845428106565
We have done a lot in the Balkans: the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo, the Balkans Task Force and new regulations to speed up procedures.	98.3523822305812
Nevertheless, we definitely have to do more.	55.02413839387801
We must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic, pluralist society in these countries with institutions, public structures, police forces and a structured civil society, but, above all, we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region, as regards both politics and the economy.	92.48246175522078
If we do not do this, we shall have failed in our duty.	49.73643705432487
Remember that the Marshall Plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources: it was even more effective because it made us Europeans work together towards a new horizon; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy.	85.77588279760688
This is what we need to do for the Balkans.	17.105793702942087
Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security, peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage.	56.774419593795585
We are clearly, once again, returning to enlargement, which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security, peace and freedom.	47.7894012866236
We have made many promises in this regard, but I believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread.	36.42684197016125
Indeed, enlargement, which will be with us for our five years in office and beyond - I am referring to the aspirations of applicant countries - must hinge on concrete, objective criteria, and also on reassuring public opinion in the countries involved and, to an even greater degree, public opinion in our own Member States.	93.63166517798862
There will be friendship, calm, openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process.	37.42208534438273
I repeat: we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater reassurance.	57.654409106888416
Our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement, or at the Balkans.	90.78411846679406
There are certain other key issues: relations with Ukraine, relations with Russia, relations with neighbouring countries and more importantly, the important question of relations with the southern Mediterranean which will be a crucial point for European history, and for security and peace in Europe for future generations. In this regard, we have a responsibility towards the whole of Africa.	71.93771714179773
In recent times, Africa has raised hopes and has received offers of help, but nothing tangible has yet been achieved. In recent years in Africa, we have not seen a shift from totalitarian regimes to democracy, but quite the contrary - a shift from democracy to totalitarian regimes.	151.43700576606344
Africa is, for us, a worrying topic for discussion. We therefore have another duty at international level, which has already been proposed by the Commissioner responsible for trade: the undertaking to relaunch the Millennium Round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries, not just in terms of writing off debts, but also via the unilateral opening-up to trade with the poorest countries in the world, with a great deal of willingness on our part, which we had already proposed prior to Seattle but which we could not put into practice.	66.18234972434841
We need to provide alternative answers, otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe' s positive roles in history.	95.45944667916916
All over the world, Europe' s actions must be guided by a deep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individuals and minorities.	59.55201702359435
We should remember that we, the European Union, are a union of minorities: we are all a minority within Europe.	58.95866387054475
There are concerns even within the Fifteen, concerns which may even surface again in the next decade.	148.86776572277137
I am referring to the situation in Austria, where the Commission has remained true to its role, being duty-bound to work towards the cohesion of the Union, but also the unwavering guardian of the Treaties, ready to punish every minor breach of the principles of democracy, law and respect for minorities.	57.05963487028852
Some people have criticised me over the congratulatory message I sent to Chancellor Schüssel.	124.4442449997729
My message to you is: do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content.	134.6150320332466
Reread the letter: The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty, I repeat, Article 6 of the Treaty.	49.193077225498264
I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the Commission when they were elected.	47.441485636418236
This is what we wish to do: maintain our role as a supranational structure, maintain the role conferred on us by the Treaties, but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts.	79.7432671045651
Last November, the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti-racism directive.	65.11224663171443
I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion.	40.77071049072277
I will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme: the economy and quality of life.	76.6452125840229
I have already talked about the economy: we well know which basic ingredients will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs.	69.3199879922916
We must continue to keep inflation under control, proceed with liberalisation, ensure more competition, encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technologies; push forward with science, and push back scientific boundaries, and develop an appetite for being at the cutting edge of science.	145.58756697750772
The forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issues - dissemination of technology, employment - will be a decisive summit.	77.24966356149692
It has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind.	25.663022576159722
We are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers.	80.36804981535317
Finally, our last commitment is to improve quality of life.	83.61012515700874
We have opened this chapter with the White Paper on Food Safety: we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector.	36.17411684161358
The Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrates the pressing need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment.	43.57694669531088
The time has come to discuss, and then establish, a body for emergency civil protection in Europe.	57.47091926721488
All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred.	68.42279986624999
I think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen.	61.363873902017026
These are the challenges that we - the Commission but also all the other European institutions - are facing.	49.17654275841254
How will we judge, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, the five years of our mandate?	47.70394391978804
How are we going to assess the results of these five years?	30.039667228970607
I do not know, but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together.	63.76638882590926
Let us take a very simple parameter: turnout at the next European elections.	31.20818079540462
If it is higher than at the previous elections, it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge.	57.46143817200009
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with all these major political challenges, but precisely because of the recovery that is now underway, we are also faced with major opportunities.	47.08515627735775
This, ladies and gentlemen, could be the decade of Europe. Indeed, I would say that this must be the decade of Europe.	35.401344908106644
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome the fact that the Commission submitted a document so that we could prepare for the debate.	17.31490180580139
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document.	38.13291259549176
And we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which President Prodi has just given.	52.32513531222087
We read in the conclusions in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes.	74.13372322240373
Europe will press ahead with integration; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will, in the end, reunite our continent.	66.12815493200924
A demanding, ambitious, perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success, Mr President of the Commission.	157.4389376126882
However, we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present.	43.4180173067697
I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully.	49.321190440484074
I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union.	22.938217219896842
We in the European Union are one Community.	50.82885343105648
We belong together, even when there are problems.	90.83010328319666
Now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe.	76.9106022633414
Mr President of the Commission, you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks.	49.956939417857335
You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties, and that is indeed your role.	43.05178642712229
For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned, we expressly respect, acknowledge and support you.	107.10146183214324
(Applause)	42.81948661699828
Mr President of the Commission, our objectives are one and the same: we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century, a democratic Europe which is able to act.	49.61495721605095
A Europe which defends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and, at the same time, looks after its global interests with dignity, patience and convincing self-confidence.	113.93771847203716
Europe' s message, the European Union' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism, no; it must be one of cooperation, partnership and peaceful development.	81.0221408947613
Globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world, which is becoming smaller and smaller, as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity.	91.57715795885888
Seen in this light, globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger, more of a coming together than a segregation, more mutual enrichment than separation.	203.51013148184276
But we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans.	67.2773856879279
Globalisation is not only an economic process, it is also a cultural process, which is why we say: we want partnership in the world, we do not want the clash of civilisations which many are predicting, we want partnership, a meeting, exchange and peace.	76.43294804344788
But we also say: we want to defend this European Community of tolerance, which is why a common foreign, security and defence policy is so important.	34.80263518446231
Negotiations with six central European countries are starting today, bringing the European family a step closer together.	270.0735486992683
We agree with what you said about the Barcelona process.	25.6594679498203
All the countries in the Mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity, democracy and the rule of law.	52.119101011801284
For us, the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, it is not only the reform of the institutions of the European Union which will be important in the next five years; it is also important that we declare our faith in the single European currency and use the policy of stability as a basis for consolidating the European currency in coming years.	26.872100199834346
We therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact.	39.65077343941482
We need structural reforms in the European economy.	36.215944351917706
Most importantly, we need to restore a European economy in which performance pays and people can work as entrepreneurs.	66.26903371187613
It would be Europe' s undoing if we were to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium-sized businesses in Europe.	28.362165519332827
(Applause) The Commission has an important role to play here by getting a coordinated policy under way with the nation states to reduce taxes so that entrepreneurship pays.	89.13158270048436
We too want to help put Europe on its feet.	79.56615559047977
You spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	76.66502377263555
We support that.	105.52173495476853
The nations, regions, towns and communities of Europe will be preserved.	94.97268690738613
However, there is a current trend - the "fauna, flora, habitat" directive was quoted as an example - which, in my country at least, creates the impression that associations are bypassing national and regional institutions and submitting programmes to Brussels and that Brussels is then making decisions affecting the property of countless agricultural holdings in the countries of the European Union.	75.47820627634806
I merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future.	48.46152608094357
Mr President of the Commission, allow me to close with these words: as the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, we have every interest in a strong Commission.	27.668982575207874
If you are persuasive in your actions, we all reap the benefits.	63.80294753460266
In this respect we wish you every success. However, we are also aware of our role as the Commission' s watchdog.	35.23065519192341
If we have the merest suspicion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the European Union, and at present we have no cause for complaint - on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case -, but if European law is infringed then we shall fight any such infringement uncompromisingly, precisely because peace in the European Union is founded on this law.	39.85299629647306
We must preserve this law and peace in the European Union if we are to be able to go forth as peacemakers in the world.	20.510774170683273
(Applause)	42.81948661699828
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to welcome the presentation of, and the first ever debate on, the Commission' s programme for government - the word President Prodi is so fond of; as I am -for the whole legislature.	26.990765658204847
Firstly, this is welcome because it explains, to our fellow citizens, what we are intending to do and what we are already doing. We must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future.	44.88318923878338
We have taken almost eleven months - President Prodi was nominated at the Berlin Summit in March last year - to establish a legislative programme. This is not entirely President Prodi' s fault.	58.15901653647866
We are recovering from a crisis. However, I believe that, in the future, it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next Commission to coincide with the presentation of a legislative programme.	20.56714199669383
We are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances.	106.01867170345494
President Prodi began his speech by talking of a paradoxical situation, a paradox in the European Union and also throughout the world: we are at the dawn of a new secular millennium, dominated by the web of the Internet and the sorcery of biotechnological advance, and we are living through a genuine change of epoch.	39.38131419425493
However, to focus on the European Union as it is today, and on the subject of government and governance - a word which, at least in Spanish, brings to mind the previous name of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, although it may be an appropriate word anyway -, the most important thing is that the European Union be provided with a good government, and, since President Prodi always defends his home town, Bologna, I would advise him to go to Siena for a while and see something which we all understand: the frescos of Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which speak of bon governo [good government] and mal governo [bad government].	61.53971808313528
What we need here is good government, Madam President.	114.8544523677536
Since we are recovering from a very complex crisis, we must try to enhance our institutions and give them substance.	53.042142573715445
I would like to remind the House of something which we often forget, and that is that the investiture of the Prodi Commission, last September, received wide support. In our opinion, this demonstrates that the majority of us are in favour of progress and in favour of Europe.	48.682527457979255
I would like to point out that, within this broad consensus, there were some Groups which said that the majority of Parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the Council.	40.23809586323135
It is precisely this which, in a sense, is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme.	78.29152037659988
I am pointing this out because I believe that our support for the Commission also has to lead to continuity in the work carried out throughout the legislature.	40.984351255575156
On the other hand, we are witnessing the birth of a political Europe, which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon, and a European Union at the service of the citizens.	47.859011579231385
With regard to the events of recent days, I would like to say - and I am saying this on the day, and the week, that the Intergovernmental Conference is starting - we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental rights which, given what we have said about the Austrian crisis, I believe should be fully included in the Treaties.	50.94027206870874
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point.	19.13998046792214
In this regard, Madam President, I would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language.	30.160223179023934
Last week, the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition described the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theatre.	62.6460881580556
Those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments.	60.465024254179596
There can be no democracy without a living parliament.	100.84291553983323
I believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now.	24.689203977782647
With regard to the four great priorities which President Prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us, I would say that we are very much in agreement.	55.5080276558529
Nevertheless, I would point out to the Commission that, as far as the Socialist Group is concerned, there has been a change of priorities.	21.714464623397493
We understand that the first priority is the economic and social agenda, which also includes what is known as 'quality of life' priorities, that is to say, the rights of citizens as consumers and as people, in relation to those questions which we always talk about, but never give sufficient priority to, that is, the European social model and its adaptation to the new circumstances, consumer rights, respect for the environment and sustainable development.	73.29446483272768
When speaking of the commitment to full employment, we have to bear in mind that, these days, full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of Beveridge at the end of the Second World War, that is to say, employment for the male head of the household.	46.567907648592936
We must argue for equality of the sexes, the famous 'gender mainstreaming' , which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission' s programme.	64.30596659667629
This means prioritising sex equality, the adaptation of the social model and, above all, an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat.	47.98522926833759
This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission. It must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise, in practice, the evolution of a Union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone, given its prosperity and seasonal demographics.	39.72043108197798
I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue.	21.840602815828174
In this respect I would also add another element, which is economic government, given the single currency, and I believe this is inescapable. This is another question on which the Commission must make progress.	57.83258306218418
With regard to the ambitious objectives and, above all, the Commission' s important step of adopting this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration, I would like - and my Group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda 2000.	46.29204980275437
Does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision?	72.4445654762476
The issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential.	33.115783564590686
With regard to governance in general, I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms.	52.78589328143112
I would like to remind you of one thing: it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the European Union from here.	34.887739631437924
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity.	27.170864542852613
If we are capable of defining what our area of governance is, I think that would be very positive.	68.8656310822958
In all other areas, I believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion.	35.50493251305905
Not only should the Commission discuss this, but also our states, our parliaments and our civil society.	83.03798651861196
Madam President, I would like to refer briefly to the last objective, which seems to us to be absolutely fundamental: the stabilisation of the continent and the strengthening of the Europe' s role in the world.	32.54385386867668
It appears that there is agreement and support with regard to the prioritisation of South-East Europe, with regard to enlargement and - as I have said already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflicts, as well as an issue which we seldom talk about; the North-South challenge.	45.35054211820919
We must not forget Africa, a continent which has been forsaken, not only by God, but also by Europe, nor our important contribution to cooperating with development.	58.642029353973314
Lastly, an issue for which we are increasingly responsible, as the world' s foremost economic and commercial power, that is, Europe' s voice in the world, which does not simply mean adopting an active approach to the Millennium Round.	79.6693436346252
It means the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institutions, for which Europe has an enormous responsibility.	34.2318628217356
Above all, Madam President - and here I will end - we must be able to express this in plain language, clearly, by changing to some extent the jargon which we use, because we cannot ask the Europeans, who are living through profound changes, to take part and show enthusiasm towards us if we continue to use a form of language which they find completely inaccessible.	79.09399378764377
This is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us. I hope this will be demonstrated when we hold the next European elections.	54.862281311039766
Mr President of the Commission, may I say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure, the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this House today: that is that the stakes now are irrefutably political.	36.44702243188728
They are political because we are moving on.	73.33326907315372
Even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks, we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective.	81.76366178451346
The challenge of enlargement is political.	72.84364510049112
The challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs, of dealing with asylum and immigration and crime, is very political.	57.153144209555734
The challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political.	20.75469119119613
Because it is political it is more complex.	69.97375953064143
Because it is political it is more sovereignty-sensitive.	128.46703821263876
Because it is more sovereignty-sensitive it is more voter-and citizen-sensitive.	96.70123621215362
We need, therefore, to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives, to address, not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy, the apathy which you identify.	100.26968702499627
The means of achieving this are difficult but they are real.	67.14063796790867
I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions, not just between Commission and Parliament, but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge.	55.19576295755957
We need more dialogue, not just with each other but also with civil society.	67.23034026014787
We need more explanation of what Europe is about.	45.4990445184251
We need to be able to confront fears and anxieties, because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself.	53.51105139817558
Perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that.	165.56486955387314
My group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a White Paper next spring addressing the issue of governance.	107.8405311045213
As we look at the Europe of networking which you describe, it is very important that Europe concentrates on its core business, that we have the courage to suggest areas where Europe may perhaps stand back.	72.01548878946649
That could convince people that Europe, in its governance, is not something run exclusively from Brussels, which concentrates and soaks up more powers, more decisions, more authority.	175.38877163118588
That is the political core of the challenge and I think you have identified it well before this House today.	49.12820255206114
For my group, enlargement is the first priority against which all the other possibilities for reform must be measured, be they governance, be they the intergovernmental conference, be they reform of the institutions.	210.3256683630535
We see enlargement as a process of partnership, not a process of "them and us".	116.98378902697108
We see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states.	171.61206477979832
I suggest to the Commission, as a repository of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement, to present a document, that explains the value of enlargement, not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense; a document, like the Cecchini report before the Single Act, that explains to people in a way which engages them in the debate that this is the grand, historic challenge facing Europe today.	58.85366852878673
We need to be able to prepare that ground carefully.	31.542577227125637
On south-eastern Europe, I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements.	102.69358278969094
In the lifetime of this Commission and this Parliament we must succeed in the task of winning the difficult and uneasy peace in south-eastern Europe.	36.37053831297528
We applaud the stabilisation and association agreements, but we would like to see more.	39.65576519160325
We will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week.	57.644622869342214
The strategic paper emphasises the global role of the European Union.	31.497142027791106
Our central aim must be to give the Union a weight in global affairs commensurate with its weight in terms of aid, trade and finance.	141.37615750129822
At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end, and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies, where we fit into UN agencies and so on.	111.54365367609087
We need to open that debate.	57.64033504151052
In conclusion, this morning, the day after St Valentine's Day, the newspapers are saying that your honeymoon period is over.	65.23587254500325
I do not know whether you are a romantic or not, Mr Prodi.	25.966916911410173
Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning.	51.908370410980915
However, we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business.	72.34666416421047
That is the way it should be.	27.491165759324222
Regarding the many adjectival descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic Europe, an enterprising Europe, a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me, in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues, give in one adjective, one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance: an enabling Europe.	99.67870625361262
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally.	33.9458606607049
You gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme.	158.21152375939928
I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day-to-day ones.	75.1820804342082
At the same time, however, it has to be said that, unfortunately, your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto.	45.76993671195511
There are a lot of good intentions in it, but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved.	49.64722573585477
As in any other party manifesto, it is full of contradictions.	126.43349446665259
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them.	12.410755913278024
First let me speak about the economy and social development.	70.42058402508003
We have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment; that is what was mentioned in your programme.	46.343477119963566
Should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria, in which - as you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be higher than, say, the three most successful countries in this matter?	136.2033901483646
Ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of, because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure. But, unfortunately, as we all know, this is an area where the European Union is totally unable to act.	66.08988572289309
Do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference.	31.668349248119274
The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone.	68.2063071453473
In this respect, Parliament will definitely defend, along with yourselves, the importance of supranational decision-making.	69.19218562989721
One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation.	189.3635204259327
I think it is very creditable that you should mention the concept of 'global administration' , as others too have said here.	47.60931932944366
However, please learn from the events of Seattle: we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade, on the one hand, with all those values of human importance that we wish to defend, on the other.	59.84442257540837
You must embark on a dialogue with the international community.	32.88837460341091
Do please try to make the international organisations democratic.	133.90568844201198
The European Union could be critically important in a process in which the United Nations and the WTO really do become subject to democratic monitoring.	56.257811170557495
We can submit motions for this together with you.	70.09130678465091
Finally, I consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society, although, unfortunately, this is another contradiction.	64.41995164291704
You ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the IGC.	50.552348108751886
We have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision-making.	49.49102471038363
What you just said is absolutely true: people want more engaged democracy.	289.0257623384235
In my opinion, this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to Europe and their interest in Europe too.	25.572603352990292
Madam President, my group was one of those which wanted to have a document allowing an exchange of views on the Commission' s strategic objectives within the group before this debate, instead of being reduced to an on-the-spot reaction in plenary.	62.52966586828942
The main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists.	32.886790719244125
We are also pleased to see certain statements and intentions which it contains and which Mr Prodi has just underlined and, in some cases, usefully clarified.	65.88482702642051
The current globalisation process is - and I quote - 'exclusive rather than inclusive and has widened the inequalities' . The European Union' s objective must therefore be to help define new ground rules within the Union and in international relations.	79.69628260421995
Clearly, many citizens are 'disenchanted and anxious' about the lack of real and lasting solutions to basic problems, such as unemployment and social exclusion, which affect our very existence. This must be one of our absolute priorities.	73.84421026082238
We do need to rethink many aspects of current Community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement is to be a success. We also need 'distinctive strategic partnerships' with our neighbours to the south and east in order to achieve stability and peace.	75.45942140971815
There are plenty of areas for serious discussion.	115.76845969660249
We will carefully study the planned White Papers and will participate constructively in the work begun or promised.	156.48824569992553
It is in this spirit that I have three criticisms to make. These must be taken into account if we are truly to shape the new Europe, as proclaimed ambitiously by the title of the Commission document and Mr Prodi' s speech and do so in reality not rhetoric.	39.40964231670358
The first and most serious criticism concerns the Commission' s propensity for rather grandiloquent self-satisfaction with regard to the European Union and for a cursory and even condescending view of our partners.	42.484439455013224
The perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lies in the opening sentence of the Commission communication.	36.69613311558804
This talks of the European Union as 'living proof that peace, stability, freedom and prosperity can be brought to a continent' and as a model showing the world the way forward. It concludes that 'our neighbours have the chance to join this prosperity, and we have a golden opportunity to enable them to do so' .	74.85541354738949
A more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view.	55.106218145560106
Similarly, the idea that the euro has fostered a consensus on wage moderation is not really borne out by the repeated nervous orders issued by the European Central Bank to the trade unions which are deemed to be too demanding.	51.307631744259076
My second criticism follows on from the first.	58.38678369600369
This extreme difficulty in seeing the contradictions of the current situation and, where necessary, confronting these is seriously limiting the will, duly confirmed by Mr Prodi, to grant public demands.	118.55102019944613
For example, at least in the countries which I know well, I doubt that the intention, repeated three or four times in the Commission document, to reform 'Europe' s social protection, health care and pension systems ...in a climate of more cautious public spending' will meet the needs of those whose confidence we apparently want to win back.	102.80833017808995
My third criticism stems from the first two. The weakness of the analysis and the obstacles to the necessary changes have resulted in a project whose scope is severely limited by an overabundance of generalisations, a rather indecisive approach and therefore a lack of impetus.	61.04430562069772
But all is not lost.	106.79079510103692
This is a starting point and we have five years to succeed, provided that the political will exists and is expressed with sufficient force and clarity.	83.70670232317097
My group is fully intent on helping with this work.	101.54339656383665
Madam President, reforming and democratising the institutions of the European Union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process.	38.50017014361909
This was the opening statement of Commission President, Prodi, when he presented the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years.	37.6499872235793
We await the White Paper on the governance of the European Union dealing with the issue of balance between Member States' governments and the European Union institutions which is to be published this summer.	26.145943336141368
On this specific point I think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedures of the Commission.	27.079025473466853
The Commission, in its proposals to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference, has indicated that its preference lies in seeing smaller Member States lose their automatic right to nominate a member of the European Commission.	41.988309464065
This is a scenario whereby the European Union has a membership of over 25 Member States.	27.96919711906414
I do not want to see a two-tier European Union built.	32.50836777411719
I believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the Treaty of Rome and all subsequent treaties.	36.10608981459544
There must be equality in terms of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions.	36.114828359964285
I would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small Member States to nominate a European Commissioner that the United States of America gives smaller states the same recognition as larger states in the United States Senate.	52.00620751267081
More or less each of the 50 states in the US has two elected positions in the United States Senate, regardless of its population.	122.27889432243916
Any future reforms of the European Union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country.	56.31782568074878
It would be very difficult for those who propose a 'yes' vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to have our nominee to the European Commission.	71.0254086676147
Undoubtedly, reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer.	31.25477888762461
Once again there are special areas of policy-making which should be left to the domain of the national Member States.	37.38396271095515
I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation, justice and home affairs, and foreign affairs at European Union level.	27.204195045527808
At present, under Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome, decisions taken at EU level concerning tax changes must be by unanimity.	166.8807573564051
I believe that this proposal should remain, as a common European taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the European Union.	42.24702130733064
I support the enlargement of the European Union.	14.007055630915923
I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner.	46.67408105557083
However, we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties.	28.175634633674413
Changes should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too sweeping, otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed.	175.84130112425828
Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radical Members.	20.50050253913658
President of the Commission, a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out five-year plans.	109.16475110753865
This is true, if we think of Russia' s plans in the thirties, but at the start of your mandate, a few months ago, you yourself announced at the Conference of Presidents that you would, however, be presenting a legislative programme, or rather, the major policy lines of the European government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today.	62.36889379473898
So, whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme, the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions, or rather a list of issues on the table. It does not, however, give us the impression that the Commission is taking a clear position on any of these points, but that it is just doing the European Commission' s duty.	68.26659945593796
In this House, in the past, large-scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the Commission, under its power of initiative, launched, not as experiments, but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress, but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the European Union.	95.74869961906042
In this case, Mr Prodi, we certainly have a kind of "Ten Commandments" : a whole raft of issues are listed, but if I may say so, we are left with the impression that the Commission is afraid to make any decision regarding what needs to be done about any of these points.	58.07266660618233
There was only one point that you really stressed - too much in my opinion - and that was that it looks almost as if the highest priority task that you are setting yourself is to cease "unnecessary" activities.	116.81851161600301
We should be careful, though, Mr Prodi, because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous Commission and backed this Commission - at least a parliamentary majority backed this Commission - precisely because, first and foremost, the reform of the Commission would bring consolidation, a new identity and a new awareness of being guided by a firm hand.	101.93402112383274
Let us consider the scenario whereby the Commission, not believing itself to be equal to the task, wishes, or proposes to shed, for example, its powers to implement common policies, which it is nevertheless accorded by the Treaty.	97.53080211332578
What do we expect from a government in any case?	31.267315194105514
What do we ask of this structure - the European Community - which is, so to speak, ambiguous and unique?	83.6516783671925
It is right for joint resources to be controlled supranationally and not to be delegated to the Member States or the TAOs, as has been the case in the past.	20.619116949601523
It seems that you are proposing the same old menu, but with more unsatisfactory implications, restricting the Commission, so you say, to the task of drawing up a few White Papers, as you proposed.	76.25733425936195
My fear - even if you shake your head, Mr Prodi - is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years, that the Commission should be a simple secretariat for the Council of Ministers.	58.16564495303261
If this is the role that the Commission intends to play over the next five years, we federalists are convinced, we are certain that this is not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the Commission intends to do in this regard.	37.94071134408387
The reform is important but, if it aggravates the situation, reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the Commission, then the structure of European integration, as planned by the founding fathers for the European Commission, will be at risk.	49.60437127632606
	785.4324778346265
As for the other points, Mr Prodi, I will take economic and social policy as an example: the European social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not coincidental that unemployment tops the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve, but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past, without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that Europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective.	60.287996124992375
If we continue to get bogged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far, I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do.	45.456822719339506
The same goes for enlargement as an end in itself, without it being linked to a reform to make the European Union and its structures much more efficient, and to proposals that the Commission could have made at the IGC.	69.8434862746999
Mr Prodi, there is one positive thing that I would like to say to you, perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members, regarding the telegram that you sent to the Austrian Government.	32.84441487922044
We approve of your position on this: you did well not to isolate that country any further.	157.44824690711917
In any case, we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action.	74.41535776216536
Mr Prodi, I repeat that this is, in our opinion, a slightly short-sighted view.	61.59029930185966
Above all, it lacks drive in the sectors I have mentioned, for example, as regards the Balkans.	64.55629857447629
Can we really continue to leave the Balkans out of the enlargement process, disregarding the fact that Croatia, Macedonia and other countries also have the right to a place in this House that is open to all?	64.69546367380048
Madam President, Mr Prodi, I should like to applaud your proposal for a radical decentralisation of the Union' s activities and ask why, then, you are proposing a legislative programme which would lead to centralisation.	38.36197872019206
I remember your predecessor' s speech five years ago.	41.40823391005437
Like yourself, he promised "less and better" , but Mr Santer finished up by having delivered "much more and much worse" , and I do not believe that you, either, can deliver the goods you promise.	150.94187325182568
You talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation.	78.45584272974781
The legislative programme is, in fact, a litany of subjects over which the people are to be deprived of influence and in connection with which, Mr Prodi, you are to take influence away from the people, even on social questions.	60.87504370858255
You talk about greater transparency, but produce proposals which would lead to documents which, at present, are available for public inspection being locked away.	131.42114336234317
Your Commission consists of the only 20 people in the EU who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced.	86.18780235332473
Local politicians cannot do that, once legislation has been passed in Brussels.	176.83931056918357
The legislative programme from the Commission ought at least, therefore, to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the Member States and to the processes of popular democracy. Otherwise, the number of laws produced in Brussels will just keep on growing.	84.2752502139363
We have passed 10 000 laws and as many amendments, and the applicant States have had 26 000 documents sent to them which, as debated by the Polish parliament, fill 140 000 sides of paper.	103.41618939665938
Even by this stage, that is already too many by far.	115.29721749232893
Brussels should make decisions on fewer matters and hand over more decisions to the people, the regions and the Member States. The only decisions which should remain with Brussels are those concerning cross-border issues which the national parliaments can no longer legislate on effectively.	113.05902662112275
What is more, the work carried out in Brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent, so that people might at least have some small sense of owning the process, now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them.	78.39638232204112
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell' Alba' s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of. Take a look at Jean Monet' s memoirs.	28.87158283907988
What he envisaged was what he called a small, practical secretariat.	229.86011148045756
That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today.	50.299060196998475
Madam President, this morning the Commission President, Mr Prodi, has set out ambitious goals for the European Union for the next five years, laudable aims indeed, to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world: succeeding with enlargement, meeting the challenge of selling e-Europe, introducing better principles of governance.	72.39566731296766
We accept that Europeans, particularly the younger generation, need to be given a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the years ahead.	60.32017322476872
But how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high?	60.29555720651737
We need to match this vision with reality.	43.34780705410188
Here there are three elements I would like to contribute.	45.49528048144102
Firstly, we need a successful European economy.	45.19606937375263
We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across Europe, confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation, encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the Internet, show that e-Europe is a good initiative.	80.65755978257997
But we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation, stifling individual initiative and enterprise.	115.67250198602547
We must not fear globalisation, but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society.	72.23614942562826
Without a successful European economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead, particularly of enlargement.	98.40121524095962
Secondly, we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity.	75.7753178310402
Doing less but better - a central plank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too.	125.26171083697126
We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation.	61.090721718387776
Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations, which seems to go in a different direction.	85.42277594207798
We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes.	61.15507535012105
Lastly, we need to ensure that there is proper, genuine reform of the European Commission.	32.76821654357785
Yes, the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body, but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament.	48.16787001652655
The information problem, which Mr Bonde just referred to, is treated like a straw in the wind, with the Commission seeming to restrict information to us, as citizens and as parliamentarians, although we have the right to it under the Treaties.	78.98318950574918
The Commission is not in fact today a European government.	34.147723268259945
The Commission does not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament.	26.40972791167166
We in Parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in Europe.	40.20896133351214
This governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the European Union, has its relevant role to play.	51.70297866220909
Therefore we need to have credibility, coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the European Union to our citizens.	79.07095330655538
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the European Union, from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy; even to the response by the 14, the Commission and Parliament to the new coalition in Austria.	41.27621265739997
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions.	55.85632688250693
Nonetheless, I agree with you, Mr President of the Commission, that many more steps to strengthen the European Union will be needed in the future because the European Union is not strong enough either to master the huge, inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which, to put it mildly, have an ambivalent attitude towards European values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent.	66.52840337638364
That does not apply to Austria alone.	46.9901345921789
The Union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in Austria.	64.2395837981466
However, the full potential of these values will only be realised if they are set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the Treaty and, in the final analysis, represent legal claims on the part of individual citizens.	60.68824875921367
When it comes down to it, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough.	25.892008873424768
In this sense, the Commission must insist, and I should like to endorse and confirm this here, that the new Charter of Fundamental Rights become part of the Treaty and create binding, enforceable rights.	49.85968835538593
In this sense, the Commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom, security and justice and in this sense I disagree with the last two speakers.	30.38354955964553
Only reasonable, feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational, misleading and demagogic allegations of the extreme right.	93.18345804328312
But, and I would like to stress this, this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment, marginalisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti-European, nationalistic actions and reactions.	53.41537526879069
In this respect, Mr President of the Commission, I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large segments of the population.	30.14556478763857
The feeling of being at the mercy of others, of lacking in influence and of having no protection from the state leads in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote, as in the European elections and, in the worst case scenario, to extremist voting patterns.	75.66789989062248
The Union, like everyone else, has not yet understood how to present the EU to the citizens of the EU as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation.	51.953525019322285
We are in the process of building a house but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our house.	91.20521415300172
What we need are not just reforms of the World Trade Organisation and the economic architecture - and, significantly, the President of the Commission forgot to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial architecture; we also need confidence-building measures for our citizens, who rightly expect help and support from and in the EU with the inevitable and painful process of adapting to new global circumstances.	77.69332721425701
In this respect, what the Commission says about boosting Europe' s voice is important.	49.036329202658884
You yourself, Mr President, spoke of a model of which, unfortunately, there is little mention in the document. You said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic, social, cultural and ecological development, both internally and towards the outside world, which differs from other models, including the US model.	91.24701765405898
In this sense, the USA is not only our partner; it is also our competitor; not our opponent, our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model.	94.86057845181644
I hope that what we have said so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforced in the Commission documents.	34.87166486355008
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the greatest legacy which your Commission could pass on to the European Union would be to help resettle and redistribute the increasingly jumbled and confused powers and competences of the Commission, and perhaps of the Union itself.	42.097037067679004
You have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so-called "core tasks".	62.21405271365917
That, as you have said yourself today, means that you must also identify tasks, policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission's main vocation.	66.82577322520433
Many existing European Union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell-by date, or have been proved unwieldy or ineffective when administered at European level.	121.55593265287716
The challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national, regional and local government.	69.32788843117952
If we are to succeed in persuading a sceptical European public of the merits of further European integration, we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the devolution of unwarranted EU powers as we are in the evolution of new EU powers.	64.40591512556392
We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim, as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde, that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only.	70.48982467357709
It must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing EU policies and programmes, which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality, are devolved and repealed.	56.19301052521715
If you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead, you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and, as we have heard today, you will enjoy widespread support in this European Parliament.	44.372046667985344
Madam President, you spoke about fundamental political values, and one of the fundamental political values, even more important than democracy, is respect for others.	87.04568086322207
We therefore feel that you acted correctly in sending a message and that perhaps those who protested about it are still feeling the effects of Bolshevism or Nazism. Democracy means dialogue with others and making others realise when they are wrong, but also listening to their explanations.	135.75696438638698
Enlargement - and Alleanza Nazionale has been repeating this for ten years in this House - must not mean dilution, that is, it must not entail more risks.	77.67795420324545
The applicant countries' hopes are at least as important as the hopes of our current fellow citizens, who are beginning to feel bitterly disappointed by the way Europe works, as it is not resolving the most serious problems.	74.83082452925748
We therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreements which - should it be necessary - need to be redrafted with regard to certain fundamental issues such as the environmental disaster that has occurred in Romania, reaching as far as Belgrade, but above all, the continuing spread of apathy as regards major security issues.	57.17252419475873
Even today, we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power stations in the eastern republics.	54.839892600168014
We therefore need resources available to spend before proceeding to enlargement, so that we can at last establish a European monitoring body responsible for monitoring quality of life and living conditions, with the aim of creating a new world where such tragedies will no longer occur.	84.28746751294449
I would also like to say a few words on Africa, Madam President.	18.016775585681092
The third and fourth worlds have been abandoned: just one dollar, one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children.	91.04561505752032
Europe, which is so democratic, so progressive, does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board, while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases.	158.62782659653027
One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation.	102.45558016063646
Globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification, just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm.	111.152026925426
The peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few.	142.60767279186464
As for the Internet, Europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules.	63.83888794419544
On a personal note, please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirates who, by acting the way they are, are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently unregulated.	81.35131579739723
We live in a world of rules and regulations: let us regulate the Internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future.	113.06501087218227
Madam President, as a Padanian taxpayer, I have already experienced the vice-like grip of the taxman and former Prime Minister of Italy, Mr Prodi, since Padania is liable to Italy for its taxes as well.	81.62618900062414
Listening to him just now, I was concerned when he mentioned new resources, something that readily translates as additional taxation, in view, inter alia, of enlargement, that is the entry of new States into the Union.	133.01963259237274
But why do they not buy their own entrance ticket?	39.25503467981156
My Padanian electorate who, thanks to Mr Prodi, have already paid what in Italy is known as the European tax - repaid only in part - have absolutely no intention, thanks once again to Mr Prodi, of paying another tax for someone else.	147.22077720059292
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Members of the Commission, five months after its coming into office, the Commission committed to paper the direction in which it aims to steer the European Union.	39.906041522377606
The ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic.	44.32513193019581
Is it not rather melodramatic to say that "the world looks up to Europe" ?	73.86924999786527
Moreover, Europe as a continent is a great deal more than just the fifteen EU Member States.	44.04058810841567
It is not rather ambitious to ensure peace, democracy and human rights in the whole of Europe, no less?	63.80367770556922
I am particularly intrigued by how the Commission considers bringing this about.	82.3516770447598
Does "the European integration model as a rich source for global administration" imply the export of a large-scale perspective and concentration of power?	165.5062219645651
According to the Commission, external policy can succeed, provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge!	195.50829682655066
So who is this then?	158.3906468918174
The Commission as a whole, its President perhaps, the Council?	70.61847485913944
You stated that the new European government requires strong institutions, while the Commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks.	60.894524265884506
We could not agree more with the latter.	34.067989567536564
It is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross-border issues and stopped decking out the European cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities.	129.8413058652931
The document mentions common values on different occasions.	141.19648022391326
Unfortunately, I find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking.	67.56218669314103
This raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on.	59.993766516646474
I am convinced that the Bible, God' s word, is the only pure source of proper standards and real values.	42.0429538671481
In the tradition of our continent, this realisation is an important one which merits recognition.	38.06383366171288
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure which to go by: the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010?	40.557980313813765
Have you already included your second term of office?	222.22816920038414
But seriously.	278.18553107008984
As it enlarges, the Union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and demarcation.	24.16745988150697
First, streamlining.	142.72114297419006
What you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the Commission is only the beginning.	61.130526706162904
The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy.	34.443867132049206
In other words, a social, ecologically-orientated market, a secure currency, guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally.	124.32633369114983
It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important.	25.987472957297204
Secondly, the new "in" word is flexibility.	137.98500285287173
However, increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into intergovernmentalisation.	294.13578077414707
We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the Member States.	84.84725517906305
That also applies to the inclusion of the civil society, which is a welcome step.	36.91287195603883
Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers.	79.06375217646887
(Applause)	42.81948661699828
Transparency does not mean more access to more paper; to our citizens, transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brussels and Strasbourg, when and with what right.	201.0131795417749
That is transparency.	95.36181370143474
Thirdly, the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly.	47.81550039858837
Its borders are set not by how may countries want to join, but by how many countries it can accommodate.	187.95744699350792
(Applause)	42.81948661699828
If the price of enlargement is the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union, then it must not be paid.	57.509791662226355
It is too high a price, not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union.	30.881879327840906
There is no future for a Union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone.	52.21061295734838
But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of Europe if it sees itself as a community of destinies.	27.736576651819558
That goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new, better quality of life.	71.02984545576456
Not only the Commission, not only the European Parliament but also the people and the states in our European Union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together.	36.3724807611465
In doing so, we need, no less, to reinvent the European Union, but without destroying the present Union.	55.464795314191534
(Applause)	42.81948661699828
Madam President, in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, the most important task of the Commission and the whole Union in the coming years is the successful realisation of enlargement.	13.09045632660897
The Commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the Union as soon as possible.	44.50805886740331
On the other hand, we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down.	49.30856279661302
To avoid this the European Liberal Democrats have expressed the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider the various models of differentiated integration and create a concentric Union, in which there is a federal core and a less integrated outer ring.	50.93576643317784
It is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raised at the IGC.	19.400385375782292
The subject needs to be discussed without prejudice.	52.36437231036809
A technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough: we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the vanguard as proposed by Jacques Delors, for example.	46.44469823505852
In this way, a decision-making system can be created that is more effective, clearer, more open and more democratic.	41.90280436299895
I hope that the Commission will make its own proposal concerning how the expanding Union might implement its institutional and other differentiation.	63.80769379525479
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, your inspiring speech, Mr Prodi, has quite won me over.	44.84163515521569
It raises expectations, but it can also lead to disappointment.	71.57820133150751
This is connected to what Mr Van Velzen was just saying, about the difference between words and deeds.	40.15395294812367
The enlargement of the Union is inspired by our wish for peace, security and stability.	37.790442860041026
You are looking to reassure the acceding countries, as well as European opinion.	56.6461614640429
But these days, we are witnessing the exact reverse before our very eyes.	105.23060244120997
We have noted increasing levels of apprehension and disquiet, even within regions where unemployment is quite low and prosperity very high.	73.44066451272742
We need to make our citizens feel at home, according to Mr Swoboda, and I agree.	49.15388432542951
This is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility.	59.7463960274341
This is probably linked to the standards mentioned by Mr Van Dam, namely subsidiarity.	68.72558955977074
It is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners, rather than competitors when it comes to policy.	52.27357543078507
It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens, where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves.	41.33514332508013
That will require a new political culture, not only in words, but also in practice, which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and regions.	48.541685519763035
Regions which, culturally and economically, sometimes match the interest of some Member States.	86.2734510715269
The new Europe should not only expand horizontally, but also vertically, by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community.	79.79648120149346
This is what the Commission will be judged on.	15.256856242634594
Madam President, the Commission is today presenting its strategic objectives for 2000-2005. These are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been glossed over to prevent any conflict.	50.20961781474627
So, in the first part on the new forms of European governance, the words 'federalism' and 'superstate' are not mentioned at all.	65.38548132624534
Yet these are the main themes in any discussion of strong European institutions in which only day-to-day tasks of execution are decentralised and a collective vision is promoted within an indistinct whole. In this scenario the governments and national parliaments are merged with the regional and even local authorities and with the civil society, all of which are described, with no form of hierarchy, as 'integral elements of European governance' .	103.01379381327052
These ambiguities mask many misunderstandings, primarily about our values.	166.09070356905903
It is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat.	38.139786460658705
It must clearly be accepted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best combines the objective conditions of an immediate, fair and transparent democratic debate, namely at national level in the main.	71.2110418234196
Yet the whole of the Commission communication is based on the opposite theory. In this theory, on the pretext of ensuring the best protection for peoples, their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limited by new regulations, new policies or new, restrictive legal structures such as the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.	101.46658362343403
This Charter is really misnamed because it will actually reduce these rights.	91.31844545463686
In the Union for a Europe of Nations Group our principles are rather different.	65.33390171549078
Clearly we want to defend the countries of Europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations.	38.98797664103165
This is not impossible.	17.984304870531332
We must move away from the outmoded federalist schemes promoted by those whose every idea on European matters comes from the Memoires of Jean Monnet.	65.46038311834614
Instead, we must open the European institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations.	96.74828060933324
This is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication, Mr Prodi, but which is unfortunately not there.	60.19426578467839
Madam President, Mr Prodi, you claim to be shaping a new Europe yet you are lacking one basic element: confidence.	184.46560374056827
The confidence of millions of Europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this.	62.053589100626745
And how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption?	79.4263933374564
You are responsible for millions of unemployed and for millions living in poverty, insecurity and increasing misery because of your ultra-trade-oriented and ultra-liberal policies and because of the forced march towards the single currency.	102.39213764981035
You wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders. Consequently, you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration.	92.48365243789023
You are now proposing to give all decision-making power to a handful of officials. The Member States, local authorities and NGOs will simply become enforcers of decisions handed down from above, all on an equal footing in their submission to Brussels.	56.45419620042931
Not once does your twelve-page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people.	103.15226009672062
Clearly, they have no role to play in your strategy.	78.68483021210376
You dare not even call a spade a spade, but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by using the term 'governance' for what is nothing more than federal, autocratic, centralised government.	177.31401359405834
Having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty, you are now revealing your ultimate goal. You intend to trade in all European sovereignty, whether national or collective, for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position.	164.63629773326304
Finally, you are daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of millions of Austrians, or are allowing this to happen, just because the result does not suit you.	122.0623587065773
Yet at the same time you are supporting Communist China and trading with countries which have openly violated human rights for decades.	78.71406360502752
Members of this House are today speaking out against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel which, quite obviously, is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre.	153.11334657857282
Your sabre-rattling fools no one because, as you know perfectly well, whether you like it or not, you need Austria in order to reform the Treaties and harmonise savings tax.	118.56549264283895
You will cynically and hypocritically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real powers in the construction of the European Union.	38.628368078018816
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this.	86.14367488843128
The governments which, through spinelessness or ideology, support you are also responsible.	250.80837404620343
Brussels is not all of us, as you claim. It is all of you.	88.3387415491424
Tell the truth for once. You could not care less what the people of Europe want.	210.47535591592109
They are free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement.	122.71604436575002
It is over ten years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and yet your projects contain a strong hint of the gulags and mollifying moralism.	39.22241295709566
We were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship.	152.42677003283555
We are and will remain among those fighting against Europeanist dictatorship. We call on all the people of Europe to resist your monstrous projects.	80.60192660302441
The salvation of European democracies is with nation states. Europe' s salvation lies in the cooperation of the nations of Europe.	71.76202841535962
(Limited applause)	133.00523505588106
President Prodi, today you have presented the Commission' s five-year programme, and it has many objectives that we endorse.	73.77758465647793
It is a programme based on real-life situations and issues, and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues.	73.0440956450473
In my view, Mr Prodi, judging from the text and the document that you had sent to us, one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance, and that is solidarity, not so much at international level as at internal level.	59.55630506676621
The Archbishop of Milan, Monsignor Carlo Maria Martini, is calling upon all politicians, in particular those like you and me, President Prodi, for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics is the principle of the active involvement of Catholics in politics, to reconsider a development process, which, in addition to economic profit, takes the marginalised and those left behind by society very much into account.	77.93944941875867
It is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up, one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone.	61.280567122455885
It also reminds us of the need for a new growth model, one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the Catholics who are involved in social problems, who see, in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public, the most natural instruments for building solidarity.	74.48003771705154
The fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom, which comes before economic gain - is thus enhanced.	283.75531419424505
This social freedom, which becomes manifest in initiatives favouring the poor, gives excellent results in terms of social justice and stability.	181.2206979746925
Mr President, public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion.	73.87478031058166
They must focus on service to people and commitment to achieving freedom for each individual, without forgetting, naturally, that all this cannot and must not conflict with the need to create business, to invest and risk, and in an ordered and focused system, entrepreneurs are able to make a substantial contribution to social growth solidarity.	93.72895698096328
In the age of globalisation, which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers, the European Commission cannot forget solidarity, and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man' s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man.	73.87108164794242
Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart.	76.02642015876447
We hope that the White Paper and the actions of you and your Commission will put this into practice.	47.91735465246917
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, 'Shaping the new Europe' is an ambitious objective both for the Commission and for us all.	34.28664587273634
Our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries, but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union.	38.306163469123874
What sort of impression will an interested public, as well as the rest of the world, have of this five-year programme?	63.08292859408826
My reply would be: a new start, a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the Union in the 2000s will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be trusted and that we take seriously.	63.47688180963953
The Commission is correct in stating that the Union intends to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation.	47.45665602069155
It foresees a just and more effective Europe that also recognises its responsibilities beyond its own borders out of solidarity and enlightened self-interest.	130.6023351515486
Consequently, we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom.	98.40783137454515
I concur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document. However, there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work.	51.458302429879915
The first concerns women, gender and women's rights.	78.41279487309542
You talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth.	76.03359843760637
That is important, but equality is not only necessary for productivity, but also to make our societies more democratic.	67.96249396359173
It is therefore noticeable that 'equality', 'gender' and 'women' are barely mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'.	54.54217869046056
You mentioned 'women' in your speech, but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals.	45.25399288955595
Is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the Commission that there is no need to mention women?	68.0712741476208
What other explanation could there be for omitting women?	152.56267463926451
The EU must not take on a masculine persona.	22.458733396722792
My other question concerns Africa, which is the only continent not mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'.	77.68814079822383
Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world, the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic.	86.75301275601606
I know that Commissioner Nielson and some of the other Commissioners are doing a fine job, but the rest of the Commission also needs to focus more clearly on that continent, partly by including it among its strategic goals.	62.487996336159746
Finally, I welcome the Commission's statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the EU is prepared unilaterally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets.	26.158363773215484
I would merely ask when this is likely to take effect.	48.92211107848509
Madam President, President of the Commission, this is a vital document for the future and fate of Europe.	24.957848910246597
However, out of all the points, two specifically require our attention, and they are closely linked: peace and stability within Europe and outside Europe.	115.77519462230623
It is a question of objectives that must be pursued as a priority.	23.422637618746794
For some time, we have all agreed on this notion, but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement, even if this comes at a price.	55.13497234641518
Today, we have been called on to choose, for the forthcoming decades, between a Europe that might be less prosperous but a beacon of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a Europe that might be more wealthy, but where there is uncertainty over what the future might bring.	59.96470858276347
These goals will be more easily obtainable only if the Intergovernmental Conference, which will draw to a close within the year, results in constitutional reform, providing the Commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement Council decisions or Parliament' s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real European government.	100.54311527559504
The first supporter of this reform should be Parliament itself, if it really wants to increase its role of interpreting the will of the Europeans and acquire the centrality which is part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrated Union.	84.0606115752081
Moreover, it will only be possible to give the Commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to the actual powers it will be accorded.	47.202186338504056
Without these prospects that we have outlined, Europe would, once again, have no future.	88.1185856629277
Madam President, Mr Prodi, we are pleased about the overall intention of the objectives announced which are in line with the challenges which Europe must overcome.	55.16795037112833
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century.	41.238637090124996
This event must underpin enlargement.	105.03914756493978
Rather than using the word 'enlargement' , I want to talk of reunification which has much greater political significance.	78.36782744024576
Your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks. This is one of the goals of your reform.	66.49319992517513
In essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity.	50.83267091545367
Precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence.	94.18230283977556
However, saying is one thing and doing is another!	205.72944418191713
You must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers.	65.84943033021824
I will therefore judge you on your deeds.	56.769925794270186
In the meantime, I approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication.	129.2828771333439
However, I must make two essential points. These concern the simplification and application of Community law.	47.288729123731734
In 1998, 123 referrals were made to the Court of Justice for non-application or non-transposition and 25% of environmental directives were not applied or transposed.	79.66619058483708
Recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential.	58.300512591225406
Community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic.	64.31878520640885
The Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this.	31.778230528712754
You are being realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate responses to the problems facing us, including unemployment.	58.91066525074728
Nevertheless, I regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed.	46.71999536461083
The emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any policy of handouts and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility.	53.306955922752145
You have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society, not only economically but also in terms of public health.	37.99015152705488
This is a silent revolution and in this respect I expected more from your communication.	40.58076870584066
Finally, you do highlight European research as being at the heart of our future.	70.83164623120028
Yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this.	43.72896104618046
Also, ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these.	111.3061558048713
If you want to better inform the people, you should start by strengthening liaison with this House, as we are the representatives of the citizens.	63.30407452659383
Madam President, we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five-year programme and of the programme for 2000, set out with so much enthusiasm by President Prodi this morning.	45.753680118770205
In the two documents, strong emphasis is placed on the need to define new forms of European governance and, to this end, to introduce a new agenda for the Commission, establishing more stringent priorities in the pursuit of the goal of full employment, through more efficient coordination of the economic and social policies of the States, and, primarily - allow me to stress this - of the nations that have joined the monetary union and which must be enabled to become the first example of closer cooperation.	59.71475279574692
To this end, I shall confine myself to stressing, out of all the choices available, the importance of three priority decisions which should, in the drawing-up of action programmes for the government of the Union, be the basis for both the Commission' s agenda and the actions of the European Union in the coming months.	43.020522323086446
Firstly, the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors, with the backing of the European Investment Bank.	46.793860143813234
Secondly, the approval of investments - where the parameters are binding when drawing up action programmes on employment - to be made in individual countries via Community projects in the priority sectors of research, innovation and training.	99.58558997206181
I feel that these parameters - particularly those of a qualitative nature, resulting from investments in continuous training, refresher courses, adaptability and retraining of older workers - are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives, that are always debatable, regarding new employment or employment cuts.	126.58062289670738
If, among other things, as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stresses as well, the Commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue, focusing on an agreed strategy of socialisation and diffusion of knowledge, in other words, a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules, this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and consensual management of the restructuring and reemployment processes.	71.74823956318835
Thirdly, I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population, owing to the ageing of the population, is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union. This is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration, but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market, and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems, certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people' s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life.	56.34291330636549
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, you have come here today, Mr Prodi, in a very reformist and ambitious mood.	32.363460978444785
I welcome you and your ambition.	64.94269763565255
Ambition will be needed, given the mammoth task which awaits us.	86.63511408640557
In order to make these reforms, however, and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme, we must be very sure, not only of the strengths of the reformer himself, but also of the opinions of others.	39.158091049520806
You say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission, but the Commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice.	28.95038950169225
We have 1.27% of the Community' s GDP.	47.744837820252116
Not a euro more or a euro less.	694.6853009285995
It will not be us who refuse these new resources. You should ask the Council.	135.79548656008478
These financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre.	45.19389275847305
In order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans, we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4, and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget.	58.20742967890468
I would remind you that this Group, the PPE-DE, does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones.	41.58710391917584
The political priorities must be set by this House and the MEPs.	47.39868177081576
Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the Community financial system.	76.83571410561588
It is all very well for us, by mutual consensus, to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation, but you must be very aware that the lack of resources, the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget, continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved.	53.9486323470314
We therefore wonder whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them.	33.43224218140419
Madam President, the Commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever.	94.8590405406289
On one hand, there are the words and, on the other, their real political meaning.	83.10314682896231
We Socialists applaud the Commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty.	56.87144779018244
Yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled?	92.59992802744347
What is meant by the Commission' s declared objective of 'economic reform' in the labour market?	25.764932903230093
Does this mean more flexibility, insecurity and fixed-term contracts?	132.6452334111678
Everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth.	79.7819474529675
The Union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient.	46.77032579482863
We Socialists desperately want a European pact for growth and employment.	39.06111675481302
The ingredients of this policy are well known. They are the stimulation of public and private investment, increased investment in research, education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise.	40.83872313577625
In this respect, the e-Europe initiative is to be welcomed.	46.5913179263623
In the world of new technologies, the main danger remains that access to information will be easier the richer you are.	87.93792471067411
The gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era.	61.035370059430136
On one hand we have the exuberance of the financial markets and the explosion of wealth and, on the other, more widespread exclusion.	32.4105863109027
We are asking workers to be flexible, innovative and ever more productive, yet the fruits of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholders alone.	123.43295656212726
The European Central Bank is keeping very quiet about the staggering rates of return on financial assets, yet it never misses an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity.	64.2023769152164
How do we explain to workers who fall victim to the rationalisations of the worldwide Monopoly game that they must be prepared to change career several times in their working lives when the captains of industry, having lost the gamble of a take-over, leave with compensation of EUR 30 million?	75.56340859427223
For years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised.	56.66091138713557
The sectors which have been liberalised are experiencing an avalanche of mergers and acquisitions, leading inevitably to monopoly situations.	91.01839859068646
All these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15%, 20% or 25% which are unrealistic in the long term.	105.31799836982157
The unfettered rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase.	67.68726882557203
The main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets.	39.00398670599083
To conclude, the next five years will be crucial.	31.92487043689748
We need new rules to regulate globalisation and we need investment in the real economy and in people. We need the Member States and the Commission to ensure the social dimension of the market economy in a visible manner.	40.56945996228047
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, in my view, this strategy paper has two clear weaknesses.	42.29303726961436
There is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one.	38.01591089347041
I am thinking of transport policy and regional policy.	26.62047306787449
You have excellent Commissioners for both issues in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier, yet still you attach too little importance to these areas.	213.29987337503204
And do you know why?	63.1627218505529
Just look at transport policy; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries.	72.35735920375991
I would be grateful if the President of the Commission would listen to what I have to say, although of course he has no obligation to do so.	18.280499914159424
Let me give you three examples.	40.732730777180834
First: we need reasonable deregulation of the railway sector because we want to shift freight from the roads to the railways.	61.26841245380608
That makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view.	56.559414616339794
Without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy.	109.3738430357088
The same applies to European air traffic control.	60.385845886653314
Our citizens cannot understand that we are deregulating air traffic, but leaving 15 different sectors in the skies which are under national control, which have an adverse economic impact on the airlines and which pollute the environment.	53.86622192673659
You still have not finished that agenda.	68.48057320741837
Commissioner, far too little is said in your paper about regional policy.	56.6526714878064
Economic and social cohesion in the EU is a fundamental task of this Community.	20.074243402344806
If we fail to complete it, citizens in less favoured regions will dread enlargement.	79.05146275730311
We must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means.	63.820017466333546
Then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it.	104.7457502793797
Mr President of the Commission, if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor regions, then this Union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people.	37.1073325284664
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, the fact that we are formulating new programmes does not mean that we should neglect those older programmes which are at implementation stage.	32.48259175609135
From that standpoint, it is useful that the Commission' s work programme comes back to the issues of Agenda 2000, the common agricultural policy, which includes fishing, and secondly, the activities of the structural funds.	36.30703237044886
I hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000.	67.22979527764204
The Agenda 2000 issues are, of course, ones that relate to your third and fourth strategic objectives, the economic and social Agenda and a better quality of life.	84.14679457104657
What your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major, high-minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the Commission intends to deploy.	64.17862478466449
I do not necessarily mean financial resources.	55.24463336900405
The implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money.	40.29175933444394
There must also be savings.	35.21925032345725
But what we need is the analytical resources: these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital.	99.38800659296048
This is because it is essential to achieve two things: the European model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secured, and this must be done in a way which facilitates the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products, mainly to the benefit of developing countries.	42.433844465616424
It is not easy to combine those aims. There is no obvious way.	49.9198633797798
There may well be contradictions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the Commission has pointed out those contradictions and how it proposes to deal with them.	43.240869379606266
As regards the other aspect of Agenda, the aspect of cohesion and regional development, there we do indeed have great achievements to point to, but there are still less developed regions, particularly island regions, to which more attention should be paid.	115.57678914630716
As for fishing, there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the predatory exploitation of fishing grounds, which has gone as far as to wipe out entire species of fish, will certainly prove fruitful in the future.	48.36101710457854
Perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse.	50.95903971584721
Madam President, I want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five-year plan.	30.05621603979141
In setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present.	48.83181064675824
That was a point made very forcibly by the leader of my group, Mr Poettering, in his opening address.	58.968138942562064
The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful European economy being in place.	52.5174575675502
That foundation is clearly the single market.	71.16501227414754
How strongly is the single market established at the moment?	56.65937138047002
I want to remind Mr Prodi, and his colleagues who are still here, of the findings of the Commission' s own survey among 3000 European businesses.	38.41758219469171
Nearly 40% of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications.	202.2077540557381
This is the Commission' s own survey.	18.133176660266994
These are the classic symptoms of continued obstruction by national governments - bureaucratic red-tape blocking market entry.	165.1013085307811
The Commission' s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market.	26.513301265052487
We have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers, intensifying pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and, of course, extending into crucial new areas like financial services.	123.61643365607243
Only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved.	107.58439240135034
An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union.	41.40887562702574
The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement.	76.33373339860073
I conclude by saying, on behalf of all my Conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this Parliament - that we pledge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieving this historic task.	53.35133007835305
Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today.	40.52571544196048
The serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme.	81.3977234601886
From your speech I will concentrate on what you have called the new governance, which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens.	65.42343624038868
Yet this new governance simply means how the institutions and our public authorities operate, if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority.	77.55578221520683
The interlinking of the EU institutions, the responsibilities of the Member States and the local and regional authorities is all very well.	25.9286785508262
Yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and European construction?	85.79862683971722
Is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about 'who does what' but more 'what are we doing together' ?	125.44521449414965
It is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens.	84.5962192551605
In your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us. I would add to these the future of our social model.	91.02013464542385
This is why I and my group are so firmly insisting on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	27.91554820426936
The reason our timetable includes the drafting of this Charter is because we are at a key point in our history. Our Union needs to redefine the values on which it is based, both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we earnestly desire, but not under just any conditions.	69.67889248039496
Our people expect more Europe, but not just any Europe.	166.03234473668013
They are expecting us not to fall in with globalisation but rather, on the basis of our social model, to be able to organise globalisation.	79.47321872608475
In this respect I must say that, in terms of your commitment to a political union, to which we are favourable, this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model, on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world.	46.74639090761302
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I should like to start with a quote: "The Commission will continue to work towards establishing a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme.	31.563979842193422
The Commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine European policy on asylum and immigration. It wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime" .	54.695292693091666
That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security, freedom, citizens' rights and judicial cooperation.	45.97208667722732
A paper this short is a farce.	140.52346546728828
A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand.	73.49678676459558
A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard.	45.07675824882217
It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it; we need a basis for a scoreboard.	34.66712613900336
We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme.	53.175107036417195
What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly, and those who are not fleeing know where they stand.	121.53808154903737
We want instruments to prevent abuse.	70.38748276410881
We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EUROPOL, for example, so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime.	40.89363612103671
We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission, even where it is merely submitting a paper.	126.84460338385468
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation, on which there is a broad convergence of views between the Commission documents and the positions of the Socialist Group. This is not the case in other areas, as has already been pointed out.	25.061959699206227
We share these views because we are in favour of world trade, but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards, common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind. This aim is that trade should benefit development, and particularly harmonious development in which the values of citizenship do not only apply to the world' s most dynamic and competitive regions.	102.63973198605942
On the other hand, what does this statement tell us about principles?	58.5426224223324
This regulation and these standards have brought an increased volume of trade for the World Trade Organisation, in other words, increased wealth, but when we look at how this wealth is distributed, we see, unfortunately, that the gulf between the world' s richest countries and blocks and the poorest and least developed countries continues to increase.	80.020414249715
It is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves, what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve?	101.09852565744862
What good are the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the World Trade Organisation works, if they cause trade to increase on the one hand, but on the other, they create problems and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor countries to grow?	67.7431613076742
That is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the Commission outlined here for the Seattle negotiations and for later ones.	49.972806939742924
We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious.	26.31025988827235
We need to be demanding and ensure that social rights, environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations.	62.00993042751565
Most importantly though, we must have a brave and ambitious long-term vision for reform, not just of the WTO but also of the ILO, the United Nations and above all, of the financial institutions, specifically the IMF and the World Bank.	45.46766176248601
We must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation. We must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process, so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly-developed blocks and countries, but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world.	56.88232331615163
Madam President, I would also like to welcome the Commission' s initiative of presenting us with a report on its strategic objectives for the next five years, although I hope that it intends, in subsequent documents, to avoid the excess of generalisations and the vagueness of the text which we are examining today.	21.773366939498324
Having said this, Madam President, I am prepared, once again, to be a voice crying in the wilderness as a result of the absence of a fishing policy.	22.677233553580034
It is really surprising that the Commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years, in view of the reform which must take place in 2002.	25.47555327970748
There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years.	19.43380961238743
However, it seems that the Commission does not share this view, although it is the Commission which is obliged to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of 2001, and it is on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification.	28.45913667025839
In fact, the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions, such as the European Parliament, which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy.	53.795428110168736
We have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply.	54.750507406513336
Less than two years is not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy is anomalous with regard to the internal market regulations and that such anomalies should be resolved within the framework of this reform process.	33.56428460646418
Therefore, Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I would ask that this issue, which is of vital importance to a very significant industry within the European Union, be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years.	28.01764477377142
Madam President, I should like to add my congratulations to Commissioner Prodi's programme.	14.680937770381863
I particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth: the information society in an expanding European market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity, innovation enterprise, the entrepreneurial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra-high value sustainable jobs for our European citizens.	112.39459596454574
I have one observation, not a criticism, to make regarding Commissioner Prodi's statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy.	63.75155233456159
We must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the European economy restructured.	36.58767438133784
After all, what is social justice if it is without full employment?	98.84863915112619
Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens.	60.09540828337108
This is a key priority for us to focus on.	24.48343132591042
I should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the Commission which will help us: in particular Commissioner Liikanen's commitment to having an innovative knowledge-driven economy.	47.6609487053888
Yes, e-Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs.	85.12168179215247
I welcome the Commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprises and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro-businesses.	34.7959562615776
That is important and something that can be developed through the Lisbon Summit.	35.559362044543825
I also welcome Commissioner Busquin's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union.	21.46144251330891
Again, this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity.	44.28036764090795
You said in your summary, Commissioner Prodi, that liberalisation, competitiveness, keeping inflation low, innovation, science and technology are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs.	140.6125457405329
I very much agree with you on that, but we can take nothing for granted.	46.879263091239444
There is still more we have to do, and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that.	33.62707367757946
So with those remarks I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success.	51.61371007633294
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme.	14.363266984879987
To me, this Commission strategy paper for the next five years reads like a scientific paper on the European Union or a declaration of principle.	71.58164866027681
Unfortunately, it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission.	27.492030954356057
As the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group, I would have expected more in the way of agenda from an Italian President of the Commission.	64.12741621675144
The Commission gives no soul to Europe.	48.74242063620716
Culture and training simply do not exist in this paper, despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe.	37.09304724873231
Just a few main points.	49.146572089038266
I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture; they create jobs.	33.23703386096629
I am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas, about consolidating and improving the European dimension of training and education syllabuses and about networking training and education policies in Europe especially lifelong learning.	74.28173864311641
Mr President of the Commission, it is the new millennium and you made no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of Europe.	30.248467565917228
Nor was any mention made of information policy and communications catering to the needs of our citizens.	91.09142827865718
It seems to me that something is missing from this programme.	20.67448117926505
Truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real, visible area of training and culture.	122.86599427944498
Declarations of principle are not enough.	75.25388562075885
We need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the Commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which I have just described.	32.27363985443829
Madam President, Mr Prodi, how would you take stock of your policy and work programme, what would your benchmark be, if you had to make direct choices?	104.03409136400798
You have the fine, charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections, or rather the turnout at the next European elections.	62.43429615622757
When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in, week out to my constituents, not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House, but on the street, then I ask myself, what can I say?	66.55591308973125
Mr Prodi, what can I say; what is there that is new?	90.73383030192262
There is nothing new in your work programme.	59.146339629327024
You have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year' s work programme.	65.06503983791954
Does that give me hope for the year 2000?	65.52746501636683
No, it does not!	163.14701047116782
In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever.	204.34844550023948
You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas.	52.541253118241045
Have you done so, Mr Prodi; have you even read your work programme for the year?	130.74645911105443
No, you have not done so.	79.94470902043624
You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement, despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement.	46.29020667969623
Nor have you integrated it into economic policy, competition or the internal market.	165.90192318273913
You have not integrated it anywhere.	70.60497307137021
You have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure.	98.53230691019321
You said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the Danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure; no, Mr Prodi, we need, at long last, to start transposing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored.	71.1887022336281
You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation.	64.58015968564338
Mr Prodi, you do not know what you are talking about.	24.918832816190154
The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world.	37.98831288728615
Where it falls short, what is missing, is transposition in the Member States and monitoring.	49.735132681457486
It is time you took your job seriously, it is time for you, as President of the Commission, to box the Member States on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties.	45.06392799395187
It is no good spending time on hobbies when there is a day' s work to be done.	50.95216351648947
That is what we expect of you in the next five years.	29.149450055569645
.	785.4324778346265
(ES) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, as chairman of this Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries, Mr Prodi, you are not making things easy for me at all.	36.84332390511678
I feel duty bound to publicly denounce the fact that fishing is absent from the programme which you have presented to us.	48.84380380252105
The next five years of the Prodi Commission - as you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change.	66.6518894208529
I hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing, since the silence of your programme, with regard to fishing, is deafening.	49.026427779814725
Not a single line, nor a single word, refers to fishing or the CFP.	124.31590024780677
I am not asking for details or specific points, but I believe that a mention was required.	43.152772408605834
How could you completely ignore a common - I repeat; common - policy with such an economic, social and regional impact, and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of Europe?	63.836544049174385
This is all the more serious, if that is possible - as others have said - bearing in mind that your Commission, Mr Prodi, has to carry out nothing less than a revision or reform of the current common fisheries policy, which you are legally required to do in 2002.	46.54668421121776
Does the Commission intend to do nothing - at least it has announced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either?	75.2344032130983
What message can we send to the fishermen of Europe, and their families, and the fishing industries, both the extractive and processing and marketing industries, and the related and secondary industries which depend on fishing in so many European ports, in so many European regions, in most cases peripheral regions, who rightly demand that this problem be dealt with as a priority?	70.06657876440485
You have made an explicit reference to the CAP for the coming years, but you have not done so for the CFP, with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent exceptions - as has already been said - and in a global context, in the context of globalisation.	27.989095960590728
This House has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second.	36.76397456107952
I would therefore ask you, Mr Prodi, to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today.	28.684368684528337
Our parliamentary Group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you.	56.42475399292334
Mr President of the Commission, this is indeed an historic moment for Parliament, a five-year programme following the crisis of the Commission.	33.44912874239339
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to focus on the point of internal reform.	11.902091419537498
We wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of Vice-President, Mr Kinnock, on behalf of the Commission.	34.1739976943578
We consider it to be of utmost importance that, in terms of financial control, personnel management and bureaucratic short-cuts, we can expect swift lines of policy and a more effective bureaucracy, for the benefit of the citizen.	64.58422465058793
At the same time, we are aware that this is a massive programme and that, during the overhaul in the next couple of years, it will be necessary to keep the actual results coming in, as before.	33.638676739719024
Much like in the Netherlands, where, at a given point, women woke up to the fact that, by referring to European legislation, they could improve their status in terms of social security, this is now also the case for scores of other citizens.	73.28244318235515
They want to see results.	69.69879738849507
Democracy, transparency and clarity always lead to results, citizens value results and this is what the Commission is judged on.	184.52076293985027
This is exactly the point which Mr Swoboda and also other Members made: fear of modernisation, globalisation, and the individual losing his own sense of safety and security.	93.88242571151844
This can be prevented if a European social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas.	62.66550795614896
I would therefore strongly advocate internal reform which delivers fast and concrete results at a social level. This gives the citizen a sense of recognition, here in Europe and elsewhere.	75.77889503170822
Because this citizen - one in five globally - still has no access to elementary social provisions, such as education and health care.	112.60294762658991
These are really the people who deserve our solidarity.	59.711364460530945
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I have read and re-read the Commission' s document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office.	35.344106654157414
I am delighted that it is being discussed in Parliament, but I also note the compromises and the omissions in it.	42.569324799270476
The Commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion, to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union' s regional policy.	25.23083660487302
And this is true even when it addresses the issue of enlargement.	39.21300662511288
Are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved?	64.59845404295315
Certainly not!	357.42986167383117
At the same time, it was rightly pointed out that Europe must evaluate its role as a joint partner with developing countries, and strengthen its activities designed for fighting poverty.	42.138117302827645
This document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included.	93.97437660118878
I think the fact that the Commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious.	24.754021267676965
It plays down one of the Treaties' principles - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all of the European institutions' policies and measures. It seems to ignore the fact that various European regions are still considerably less advanced than others.	68.6227986056676
It also forgets that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right. Unless we achieve real convergence, the cohesion of the European Union itself will be at risk.	64.05162676764232
We should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions in the European Union, for which the Commission is responsible.	18.303099156640467
This report confirms that whereas an average level of development is given a rating of 100, the ten so-called "strongest" regions reached an average of 158, and the ten so-called "weakest" regions reached a figure of around 50.	141.34818370607064
You may draw your own conclusions.	124.73302954883641
50 is exactly the level of development of my own region, the Azores, one of the regions defined in the Treaties as ultra-peripheral.	73.5614400068725
I am waiting for the Commission' s report on the ultra-peripheral regions, which the Council decided should be drawn up by December 1999.	25.435091120223042
I shall finish by restating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion, there will be no cohesion at all, only disunity.	44.32747807384876
Madam President, Mr Prodi, Europe needs a strong Commission.	90.2317467579718
As intended by the Treaties and the will of the people, the Commission is the driving force of European construction which is like a rock of Sisyphus which we have to push back up to the summit again together after each round of enlargement. We therefore need a strong Commission but one which relies on the support of a parliament.	58.01545708292411
This House is therefore your ally but not one which is too accommodating. You must therefore listen to our opinions, one or two of which I wish to express in my brief speech.	54.18541909593543
Firstly, Mr President, although your two predecessors concentrated on developing an internal market and establishing the single currency, it has been left to you to develop this whole value of citizenship which is at the heart of European construction.	62.037435359988784
You must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement, however important this may be.	73.75187263555894
You must go further, towards reconciling the people with Europe, in particular those people who are falling victim to economic, social and, probably, in the future, technological divisions.	61.471002489720235
The promotion of scientific development and new technologies and access for all to these technologies will not be provided by the market or competition. The latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community services of health, education, transport, communications, water and whatever else.	87.30352754082642
Your action programme and your objectives are reserved, even silent, specifically on the stimulation of public investment which is needed.	97.79736785362269
This is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services.	53.67419409809356
This is an absolute priority if you are to reconcile Europe with the people and ensure that the people choose Europe rather than Jörg Haider.	58.51543923532328
Madam President, the Commission was correct to make food safety one of its top priorities.	79.24979666036961
The recent dioxin scare in Belgium, prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain, and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically-modified foods, have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat.	65.19221309032557
If the Commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the European Union institutions themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the rights of EU citizens.	56.21179690056615
I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety, public health and consumer confidence features prominently in the Commission's work programme for 2000.	25.02755402276081
However, I was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper.	21.7004546491096
In its present form, what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decision- and law-making powers more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration, which has already established credibility in this particular field.	132.0782092346674
Furthermore, future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the European food authority and the authorities of national Member States, for example the food safety authority in Ireland.	41.385582737837694
This body, for example, alongside the recently established cross-border body in Ireland for food safety, is already doing good work.	130.05191932560638
It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation.	39.79073287094712
My fear is that such deficiencies in EU legislation could lead to turf wars between national and EU bodies, who should be working together rather than against one another.	69.8970929233597
That is something we must guard against.	25.96059667435663
Madam President, the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair.	68.67130960055354
We will be looking for the detail year by year, for example in the social action programme to be unveiled this year.	55.74404284174057
We will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy, and will be applying a number of tests.	46.549680658126
We will be looking at the extent to which we can create an equilateral policy triangle combining economic policy, employment policy and social policy.	30.372352395186457
At the moment, social policy is trailing well behind economic and employment policy.	41.08411175280084
Within the employment strategy we will look for a deepening and broadening of the strategy following the review under the Portuguese presidency and within the framework being proposed by the Portuguese Presidency.	54.98975171012084
Within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect.	31.439027090553285
The spate of mergers, takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive.	39.42248872962292
We also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change.	84.8019943906785
That is the successful way to manage change, and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place.	34.180182370352625
Finally, with the emergence, the resurgence, of the xenophobic Right within the European Union I hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to give reality to Article 6 by using Article 13 to combat discrimination, and Article 137 to combat exclusion.	65.59858807791294
We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now.	148.3083873473511
The aspirations are fine, President Prodi, we want those aspirations to be matched by action.	146.31846075554807
Madam President, I hope that it is a good omen that there are still a few i's left for me to dot.	37.519525550125074
Mr Prodi, you set great store in your reform efforts on introducing a forward-looking employment policy throughout Europe.	162.74973139560208
However, for the economic sector which I represent, i.e. fisheries, this means change.	90.99674409073378
We need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which fosters personal responsibility.	105.54704728238148
We must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry.	56.34328943714628
What it comes down to is the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and offshore fishing.	34.46861073365886
However, I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor, which affects not only Germany but all the coastal regions of Europe.	31.54708975174507
Plus, this branch of the economy is one of the few sectors in which Europe has fully integrated powers to decide and act, which is why we expect to be given a right of codecision here too.	71.9157668422879
This has since been unanimously approved.	66.581878473289
The fisheries policy is due for review in a few months' time, i.e. at the beginning of the year 2000.	27.305278371447823
So it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper.	35.029873273925915
I hope that this is a misunderstanding.	9.965016508137412
Please, Mr Prodi, stand by your word and implement your promises.	260.3436942002206
Madam President, many of the speakers from the Socialist Group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the Commission' s statement.	29.935947353947093
However, we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission.	44.17401501678032
One area that I want to focus on, in addition to those already identified, is that of cultural diversity in Europe.	62.30513452325363
The introduction to this statement acknowledges under the quality of life section that it is important.	64.57517121470865
But there is nothing in the statement which indicates that the Commission intends to take any steps to deal with the issue of cultural diversity.	25.570317086287645
If we are to ensure that we defeat the fear-mongers amongst us - those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other, both within the present European Union and among those who seek to join us and, indeed, among those in other parts of Europe and the world who want to come and live and work in Europe.	63.285694082891744
Unless we address these issues, unless we dismantle these negative stereotypes, unless we take what is best from our various cultures and languages and protect and expand it and ensure that we are serious about having a diverse Europe, we will fail.	126.8935445572028
Those who are currently coming to the fore in Europe based on fear will win the day.	68.63873602152087
I am seriously concerned that unless the Commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a cohesive Europe, we will make progress on the economic front, on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy, but our citizens will still remain fearful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand.	45.388899142347746
If we do not take steps to deal with that, we will fail ultimately.	28.961594119698564
Thank you, Mr De Rossa.	27.3096600106247
Before giving the floor again to the President of the Commission, I must tell you that I have received, pursuant to Rule 37, seven motions for resolutions to conclude the debate.	31.31142597330017
Welcome	760.5506724104712
I would like to inform you that there is a delegation from Kuwait, led by His Excellency, Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah, Vice-Prime Minister and Defence Minister, here in the official gallery.	40.25109716876497
On behalf of the House, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament.	13.883546068986124
Mr President, I should like to raise a point of order in relation to the activities organised today by the Association of Parliamentary Assistants in support of their call for a statute for assistants to be adopted as soon as possible.	38.55295890945333
I understand that on 26 January the association wrote to the College of Quaestors requesting permission to set up a table outside the Hemicycle today to publicise their initiative.	96.21149337716125
On the same day, I understand, Mr Balfe gave permission for the assistants to go ahead.	60.796690944960424
The Parliament services asked to meet with the assistants yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangements.	130.74172099438815
However, the appointment was cancelled at the last minute.	41.058857656837255
Parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn.	103.70739551224369
Mrs Banotti apparently promised to write a letter explaining why permission was withdrawn but so far no letter has been received.	144.59414757792243
Can you explain why the approval given to the assistants was withdrawn at the last minute?	55.457258238859374
Do you agree that the assistants have a legitimate case which must be heard?	72.64942569733795
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that such last-minute cancellations do not happen again?	50.26886083788283
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible?	31.372117279797298
Finally, will you make sure that in the meantime Parliament's rules are properly implemented and that assistants are paid, as they should be, on the basis of all the work they do for us?	52.58309679311731
Without them we would not be able to function.	35.649759107298756
Mr President, I also rise on a point of order.	32.40386426931933
Are there any rules or regulations that govern demonstrations within the building of this Parliament, outside the doors of the Hemicycle, to ensure that MEPs are free to come into this Hemicycle to discharge their mandate?	95.42704292891752
If there are such rules, who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility?	104.22048402110701
Mr President, I would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistants, which we have always considered to be a priority, and inform you that - as the Italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader, Mr Barón Crespo, we have forwarded the contracts that we drew up with the assistants to the Quaestors.	39.31855964135246
I think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway.	20.634312926401414
I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to invite the Members to do likewise.	22.924106338405092
Mr President, first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assistants.	20.68179244630098
Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament.	104.11274868731529
As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are filtered first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament.	90.02666082480391
To give a non-contentious example, no commercial exhibitions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reasons.	98.67378283140278
Following a letter I received yesterday, I immediately informed the assistants that we would propose that they be allowed to hold a meeting or demonstration, probably in the near future and possibly in the next month.	90.51931552288252
But all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament.	32.16549636888234
I signed a letter yesterday afternoon, in the meeting of the Bureau of Parliament, in which the assistants were informed of this.	53.72303657669992
But I am also told that they were informed verbally of this decision by the Committee of Chairmen of Groups last Thursday, so they were fully aware of the decision.	59.919776598367385
There is no problem with them telling us the way they feel, there is no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament's next part-session.	56.70834787204187
But there was some misunderstanding, for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission.	141.1634934908365
But all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so-called Comart committee.	64.68691900942919
As you can see we have many exhibitions around Parliament, whether they be about different countries or whatever.	150.59312751558232
This is not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants.	47.540298900145345
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.	13.403073124681542
I think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised.	144.15754073881345
Mr President, I wanted to point out an important matter of principle.	22.18497069423689
I personally believe that it is nothing short of scandalous that we hear Members of this Parliament attacking the demonstration rather than looking at the solution to the problem, which is fair conditions, fair pay and fair hours.	85.42790842322945
We shall now proceed to the vote.1	57.420353243540745
VOTE	281.09893356486054
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the European People' s Party, the delegation of the Spanish People' s Party, with regard to Mrs Terrón i Cusí' s resolution on the area of freedom, security and justice.	13.12970241694053
There have been some votes where we have not followed the guidelines of the Group of the European People' s Party, and we have voted in favour of the Terrón i Cusí resolution, which we consider on the whole to be excellent.	33.4240571024231
However, we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6, because they seem to us to be legally incorrect.	56.6686390700552
On the other hand, we have voted in favour of Recital J which, in fact, is in line with what I, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, proposed to that Committee, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference.	27.28133826723293
We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13.	18.246270533261416
An appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for residents of non-EU countries is something which the Spanish People' s Party has been advocating for some time.	89.80469635505145
For similar reasons, we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which, with the oral amendment, dealt with certain very justifiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity, since political rights, not just voting in local elections, but political rights in general terms, form part of the sovereignty of Member States.	78.8336995515885
Given the oral amendment, we felt we could vote in favour and that is what we have done.	30.500954798007196
.	785.4324778346265
(DA) The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have chosen to vote in favour of the proposed resolution, but are at the same time aware of the fact that certain areas clash with the reservation Denmark has in the legal sphere - a reservation which the Danish delegation in the Group of the Party of European Socialists naturally wishes to respect.	50.58393583526351
This report which I voted against is less concerned with human rights than with 'communitisation' or the consolidation of Fortress Europe.	85.47040580493231
The supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the Dublin Conventions and Schengen Agreements and a further action plan from Tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants.	141.1773604437001
In terms of human rights, this is a backward step.	20.062042626456726
Europe is continuing to expel nationals arriving from countries regarded as dangerous by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Yet some applicant countries in central and eastern Europe are taking in gypsy refugees expelled en masse from Belgium.	78.54230896914207
Kosovo Albanians and Serb deserters are being refused refugee status, whereas Pinochet is calmly escaping prosecution.	143.26504944982938
The Europe of Schengen clearly finds it much easier to hound the persecuted from the south than dictators, even though the UN estimates that we will need 159 million immigrants to maintain a stable population between now and the year 2025.	100.67201985526602
Europe should regularise the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections. Only then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice.	82.81461197008895
McCarthy report (A5-0026/2000)	11.192013816698973
Mr President, I would firstly like to point out that I was Mayor of Bilbao during the nineties, which gave me the opportunity to present one of the first urban pilot projects to be subsidised by the Commission.	23.45468042009969
Our experience with that pilot project in Bilbao led us to four conclusions: firstly, that Europe must maintain an urban policy and therefore, far from reducing the EUR 900 million for the last five year period to EUR 700 million for this five year period, the funding of this project should be increased. This should be done, for example - and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has proposed this - by reinvesting, in URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which each Member State has not spent within the time scales laid down for that purpose.	58.65612424769839
Secondly, when deciding which areas must be subsidised, we must concentrate efforts on integrated projects.	156.10152421084516
Disparate actions are not effective.	73.25152445080141
We have to select locations by prioritising those which are most impoverished and needy, in accordance with the objectives set, that is to say, the social, economic, environmental and democratic management dimensions, as well as the relationship between them.	37.79620065264633
Thirdly, we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other Community programmes, as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question.	37.20808687854063
Finally, we have to put our trust in, and support, the institutions which are closest to the citizens, that is, the local councils and bodies.	49.78817708117366
They have more first-hand knowledge of social needs. They have more involvement in the problems and, furthermore, they know how to conceive projects and implement them effectively without weighing them down with bureaucracy, and thereby achieve better results.	142.39077986153742
Lastly, in today' s vote on our four amendments, two have been approved and the other two rejected.	138.17838219049364
This has obliged us to abstain from the final vote, because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when deciding which projects must be financed and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each Member State can dedicate, to URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which it has not spent in accordance with Community programmes.	46.60011647980888
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had an in-depth discussion on the URBAN initiative which produced many ideas.	32.99960148910334
As the smallest Community initiative in existence, we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected.	101.57797409022628
We regret this as there was actually money left over from the Structural Funds in some countries which could really have helped with pilot projects. We should remember that it is these URBAN projects which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be established.	102.95290201921091
The Commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policies which are in place. It should make URBAN projects coherent with future projects in budget lines entitled 'sustainable urban policy' .	107.76491531732916
Finally, there is currently still no European urban policy within the European Union. Perhaps this point could be developed in the context of reorganisation and the Intergovernmental Conference so that the European Union finally has a true urban policy.	46.52293032494781
Mr President, I would like to point out that I voted for this report on sustainable urban development, known as URBAN.	30.661066573544836
As with all other Community initiatives, this is very positive.	50.89445704889139
Europe is making its presence felt at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of Europe and not simply for the development of an individual State, whichever one it may be.	51.033875287993745
URBAN is designed to find solutions to urban decay, and this is something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the Pensioners' Party.	67.745907072123
There can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city.	109.64197946230827
I hope that this Community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problems faced by the elderly in cities.	36.763606423910474
. (DA) The Left' s five Members of the European Parliament have chosen to support LEADER+, the EQUAL initiative and INTERREG, but not URBAN.	133.01271904334965
At a forthcoming review of these programmes, it ought to be established that the EU' s efforts are to be concentrated upon cross-border tasks and adapted to the possible enlargement of the EU.	37.98679132166937
. (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for a Community initiative relating to the economic and social regeneration of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis and designed to promote sustainable development (URBAN).	31.27204183674778
Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think, in general, that the proposal for regenerating neighbourhoods in crisis contains some sensible observations, as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects.	81.49967258185008
This report contains general points on what is referred to as the urban regeneration strategy for town centres and neighbourhoods affected by the crisis in the capitalist economy and its consequences, i.e. increasing unemployment, exclusion and delinquency.	78.74165577587645
It underlines the fact that, in order to ensure sustainable urban development, an urban policy must be implemented which does not leave out the main victims of the economic crisis, namely the unemployed, immigrants, refugees, women and the socially excluded.	67.5815513805901
However, nothing is said about the causes of this crisis and those responsible for it.	53.68697974884349
At best this report simply corrects certain aspects and effects of the crisis. Yet only scandalously limited resources are available for this work.	116.99120829716077
As the report itself indicates, the funds allocated to the URBAN II programme for the 2000-2006 period are approximately 30% less than those in the previous period, which were already low, at EUR 900 million. Added to this is the fact that only about fifty projects are considered for the whole of Europe which is pathetic when practically all European city districts, both suburban and inner city, are affected.	78.16819700315398
This is why we will vote individually in favour of the specific measures planned to help certain social categories which are most disadvantaged but will abstain on the report itself in order to denounce the fact that in the main it consists of pious hopes financed on the cheap.	58.306712287557254
- (FR) Mrs McCarthy, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that the URBAN Community Initiative is being continued as this aims to support the social and economic conversion of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis, all with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.	44.22983776424241
With some 80% of the population of Europe living in an urban area, cities are at the forefront of economic, social and cultural change in Europe.	45.10016083819637
At the same time, the social and economic problems facing European society are more pronounced in urban areas.	31.048298680416153
Many European cities are divided into neighbourhoods characterised by high-added-value activities and high-income residents and other districts characterised by low incomes, high unemployment, substandard and overcrowded housing and high levels of welfare dependency.	128.50496242300562
The concentration of economic and social problems in certain urban areas calls for targeted intervention taking full account of the complexity of the problems involved.	66.0040025864627
This is why the European Parliament successfully called for the URBAN Community Initiative or CIP to be extended during the reform of the Structural Funds.	28.741489150730978
The success of URBAN during the 1994-1999 programming period is indisputable.	59.82801659909043
The results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas.	31.71253433188174
This CIP has encouraged the development of best practice models in the economic, social and environmental sectors.	63.111421056029016
It has also had the distinction of strengthening the role of local authorities, the non-governmental sector and local communities and of supporting new partnership approaches to urban regeneration.	89.72764943556632
The new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them, while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially marginalised and disadvantaged groups.	98.96253502821378
We can therefore welcome its adoption.	66.96452988420191
We must, however, admit that in financial terms we cannot proclaim a victory!	52.998114030180304
The total appropriation allocated is not up to the challenge.	53.986242117960316
The amount for the 1994-1999 period was EUR 900 million and will be EUR 700 million for the 2000-2006 period. This represents a drop of 30%!	55.16529351611008
This reduction in funding has led to a reduction in the number of programmes in the new URBAN initiative.	40.5935032788539
The chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low.	202.35976935717835
It needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the Member States.	52.00118606043888
In view of this concentration on a limited number of projects, the publication and dissemination of the results of the new URBAN Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect.	47.992483138055874
The McCarthy report on the URBAN Community Initiative gives us an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of Community intervention in urban matters.	43.7133564133442
The situation of certain urban areas is alarming, with the social distress taking the form of unemployment, misery and crime.	64.74431639456635
Drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency.	81.74229917796477
Faced with these social challenges, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt.	54.328036340339445
Subsidiarity should make us realise that the state, exercising its governing functions, and local authorities are the bodies most able to intervene appropriately. The state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help disadvantaged people.	153.9259075575669
Although we welcome the determination to create a system of exchanges between successful enterprises, the problems specific to each urban area cannot be dealt with in the same way.	68.30547767165277
The URBAN Community Initiative is helping to achieve the European Union' s desire to communitise urban policy.	35.66142241784803
It would be more appropriate for the EU to concentrate its financial efforts on pre-existing European policies.	60.03826729771283
Clearly some people are profiting from the opportunity to indulge in another budget bidding race which is particularly mistimed when the convergence criteria for EMU are imposing a very strict slimming regime on the national budgets.	87.92610066189741
Mrs McCarthy is therefore suggesting an increase in the funds allocated to URBAN and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign extolling the benefits of a federal Europe.	74.78031570430767
We should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure is not measured by the volume of funding allocated to the project.	34.65440819579463
In fact, the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted.	175.87366930219707
The aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility.	47.04442361304986
Finally, the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or sociological minorities.	123.93674194422938
We can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion.	76.6532168574416
On one hand, this policy encourages the integration of immigrants where it should favour their assimilation into the culture of the host country. This would prevent the development of ethnic ghettos which are nothing more than urban powder kegs.	66.73794728600733
On the other hand, it manipulates the principle of positive discrimination. This is a politically correct fancy which can be just as harmful, as shown by the US precedent.	43.4579205857357
For all these reasons, the French delegation of the UEN Group could not approve the McCarthy report.	37.37646760310371
Decourrière report (A5-0028/2000)	14.282301867798909
Mr President, the INTERREG programme is particularly close to our hearts.	38.36790592112322
Like many of my colleagues, I am pleased that the European Parliament was able to safeguard this initiative.	17.700807466268184
As I live in the Sarre-Lor-Lux Sud region of Belgium, I am well aware that the regions are where Europe is being created. They are where we live the European experience on a daily basis and where the people make European construction come alive.	66.76258293693287
These projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development.	40.18951490031402
Why am I stressing this point?	137.34307789391295
The answer is quite simply because the projects currently being submitted are still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they are submitted.	59.95147129928095
For example, to accept new roads is to accept new pollution within the European Union. This goes totally against the policies which we are proposing to fight greenhouse gas emissions, for example.	70.40765723848226
I would also ask the Commission to ensure that the environmental pillar of the EU' s policy is integrated into the projects submitted and that the goal of reducing CO2 for example forms an experimental added value in the projects proposed.	41.22914041645528
I am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction.	32.02873787157899
We know that some Member States are still wavering, for example, between rail and road for routes through vulnerable areas such as the Pyrenees, as in the Aspe valley.	34.568389386643986
However, I am also thinking of my own region where my government is still debating whether to route the railway or to build a second motorway, the A32.	61.13326680239528
In this respect too, I would ask the Commission to be particularly attentive about ensuring that there is real cohesion between the various policies, specifically in the INTERREG programmes which are being submitted.	42.08741295754983
Mr President, I voted for the Decourrière report on the Community initiative INTERREG, mainly because of the reply Commissioner Barnier gave to some Members who took the floor and asked for this programme to make greater reference to border regions with maritime frontiers. I voted for it, not just because I was born in a coastal town, Genoa, but above all because the frontiers of regions bordered by the sea are frontiers too.	66.8712600709724
These frontiers stretch as far as African states and the Middle East: we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions in every part of Europe.	33.61700543231983
As an MEP from a border region, I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest.	90.54379223736832
We can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically, socially and culturally.	80.74237133067763
Due to the existence of these borders, they have become peripheral areas within the countries to which they belong. This has too often led the national authorities to neglect these regions in national policy.	65.76062980129818
This is why the INTERREG Community Initiative was launched in 1990.	27.418141978026725
This programme was designed to encourage cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union.	21.149558971995702
INTERREG serves principally to fund Community schemes to develop SMEs, education and training, cultural exchanges, action to combat health problems, the protection and improvement of the environment, energy, transport and telecommunications networks.	168.87881471991628
I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration.	34.91279377594721
More active participation by these authorities in Community initiatives should be promoted, bearing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal frameworks and different levels of development on either side of the border.	80.66198286383485
In cross-border cooperation, greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertakings which are the job creators.	31.801286664226883
In the same respect, given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50% of all unemployment, the INTERREG funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment.	134.04923899637168
Obstacles too often caused by double taxation and social protection are preventing, braking or hindering cross-border mobility.	87.87990987097017
I hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region!	39.1851281468043
INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area.	37.58229385843961
Finally, and in particular, expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for Objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through INTERREG!	166.23831540683616
The challenges are therefore immense. The integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy!	46.087328134448256
I hope everyone, like Mr Decourrière, whom I congratulate, will realise this!	172.15825396313758
- (FR) The INTERREG Community Initiative is just one element of an ill-fated European regional policy.	66.4022647130435
This apparently generous policy, officially intended to help problem regions, is a fool' s bargain for French taxpayers.	150.14220095818766
France contributes 17% of the European budget yet will receive only 8% of the regional Structural Funds.	154.1525792625196
Between 1994 and 1999, our regions annually received an average of FF 15.4 billion but will receive only FF 14.7 billion between 2000 and 2006.	166.98455535334253
My region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais will be particularly affected with French Hainaut losing the aid paid to Objective 1 regions.	96.2184669665719
This loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by free-trade Europe.	57.6868035029269
The European regional policy also reinforces the centralism of Brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the Structural Funds.	43.85232594804569
This is a Europe of regions in which the regions, which are weaker than the nation states, will easily submit to Brussels.	46.70719850426356
The INTERREG initiative, launched in 1990 to prepare the border regions for a Europe without borders and therefore without nations, sits comfortably within this philosophy.	116.50676643012534
However, Mr Decourrière does show some common sense by denouncing the failings of the Brussels technocrats.	80.05251047542723
These failings will result in particular in the late implementation of INTERREG III and therefore in financial losses for the regions in receipt of aid.	85.03450031857344
We also agree with the rapporteur about asking for more attention to be paid to small and medium-sized undertakings and, of course, about refusing to use outside service providers.	45.47596621762793
These are the procedures which caused the corruption scandal in the previous Commission.	52.27176832824273
However, these isolated elements which make sense and for which we voted, in no way remedy the Eurofederalist philosophy which characterises the Community initiatives, particularly INTERREG.	96.83814360945944
This is why the National Front voted against the report.	32.1920031681424
The European Parliament has delivered an opinion on the Commission guidelines for the INTERREG Community Initiative concerning cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.	30.661271258929983
I want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative.	26.426003260934827
This does not involve the concerns about the future of the Atlantic Arc but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime borders into strand A on cross-border cooperation.	52.543896341828486
In the Commission guidelines, few maritime areas are eligible for INTERREG IIIA. The amendments to the Decourrière report aim to make INTERREG more maritime-oriented.	200.31688381768524
This is an important development which must be supported as it is the future of the EU which is at stake.	22.25083554453591
I am aware of the Commission' s reluctance on this subject as it announced during the symposium on the presentation of INTERREG III last November.	32.755835988660074
However, I must point out that preventing the recognition of maritime borders amounts to denying the existence of an area which has great potential for projects and innovation.	47.32956047347177
One example of this is the 'Celtic' area which encompasses the territories of Brittany in France, Cornwall and Devon in the United Kingdom and Cork and Waterford in Ireland. This is an area whose locally-based economy is characterised by dependence on the fishing industry and the importance of the agri-foodstuffs sector.	31.48295976891299
It also has excellent cultural and relational links, through twinnings for example. INTERREG III, strand A, would allow the regions in this area to advance a number of structural projects needed to develop small and medium-sized undertakings and to promote research and technical development through knowledge transfer.	94.51747450659032
The European Commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions.	37.62508579535571
This policy would have important economic consequences for the fishing industry in Brittany in that catches could be unloaded at Irish advance bases in order to then be transported to the Breton agri-foodstuffs industry.	62.20657733783156
The integration of the maritime border into strand A would finally allow the western periphery to be recognised as a unique and important economic area which is confronted by the 'continentalisation' of the European Union.	52.69539571012867
This would show respect for these peripheral areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the east.	65.78239523807724
The maritime world has great potential.	140.61093656685946
We therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot Community programmes which will allow the new geographical and economic map of Europe to be defined.	57.2324774481691
. (DA) The European project began as a partnership between States.	132.15494090882078
This partnership has ensured peace and stability in our part of Europe for over 50 years.	68.2519851494276
As a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world, of which the EU is just one proof, and in view of the ever greater proliferation of our Western values, competition on the world market has grown considerably within the last few decades.	51.78370918960118
The EU should be prepared to meet that competition.	43.82277903008386
We can only do that by intensifying co-operation within the Community.	80.59439389228288
It should not be about greater integration of the EU countries in the form of a federation but about using our economic potential across national borders.	86.84800212478625
It is about co-operating on joint projects and about unifying forces on all sides.	183.67040457333846
A programme such as INTERREG is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders, projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale.	75.40845234095931
I therefore welcome the continuation of the programme.	22.415675715627376
. (FR) Mr Decourrière' s report is not without merit: at the end of a clear and comprehensive presentation of the INTERREG initiative and its role in opening up border regions, it comes out in favour of SMEs in paragraph 16.	72.48226306954973
I and my colleague Dominique Souchet, who is well versed in this matter, have tabled five amendments highlighting the role of SMEs and craft trades within the framework of INTERREG, the importance of cooperation between undertakings and the need to involve economic and social partners in the design and implementation of the programmes and I welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously.	44.48854850783696
Nonetheless, the French delegation in our group was unable to accept the fact that the Commission and the federalist faction have diverted the INTERREG initiative from its original purpose in order to detract still further from the political role of the nations.	57.01320944797758
We have no intention of giving Brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the Member States, as suggested in recital of the report.	57.460396990975525
We only ask one thing of the Commission: that it confine itself to ensuring that the implementation of joint policies does not upset the balance of regional planning in our territories.	66.07598946007072
The destructive effects of the CAP and EMU on the balance between regions, especially on the vitality of the more rural, the more remote and the least populated regions, is proof positive of the fact that such ambitions are not a sinecure, far from it.	65.01861134405011
We are therefore unable to approve the development of strand IIIC of the Community initiative encouraging interregional cooperation under the responsibility of the Commission and sidelining the Member States.	37.693287600463805
This infatuation with strand IIIC is all the stranger in that the rapporteur himself acknowledges in his explanatory statement that 'the draft guidelines do not provide any indication of possible fields of co-operation' (p.17) and that 'the responsibilities are diffuse and vague' (p.18).	121.51542369679876
Calling under these circumstances, as he does in paragraph 20, for the budget for this strand to be increased is another example of the irresponsible and ideological outbidding tactics which are customary in this House.	92.61494197389621
Lastly, there is the desire expressed both in the Commission document and Mr Decourrière' s report of using INTERREG for peace and reconstruction in the Balkans: I do not think that the Structural Funds should be used to repair the damage which the Americans inflicted on Serbia during bombardments which were as criminal as they were ineffectual.	58.91257545572225
It is up to Washington, not us, to assume responsibility for a conflict which was triggered merely to serve its interests.	56.35081258008441
The French delegation in our group is therefore unable to support the Decourrière report and will choose to abstain during the final vote.	57.193574320609606
Procacci report (A5-0025/2000)	11.297374143539638
Mr President, I voted for the Procacci report on rural development, not only because I endorse the major policy lines of the LEADER programme, but also because it complements the URBAN programme, which I spoke about earlier.	40.33577062010579
Just as elderly people in cities are very isolated, so the elderly are fast becoming the sole inhabitants of rural areas because young people are moving to the cities: they are drawn by the bright lights, and the pubs, and the countryside and rural areas are being emptied.	73.25271204808593
I therefore believe that it is very important for everyone to back this European Union plan and for it to be further developed.	35.55495375127676
- (PT) Although this Community initiative, LEADER +, follows on from previous initiatives, it has some unique features.	200.04722562453915
One of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period.	182.21578419918447
Nevertheless, new objectives have been included, specifically the financing of the Nature Network 2000, for which all rural regions will be eligible.	125.1104478448493
In spite of the fact that this Community initiative is aimed at rural development, it does not address the issues of agriculture and agricultural production in a consistent way, and this is unacceptable.	38.19651582754047
Without agriculture, the rural world will disappear.	218.51103764074793
This means that any strategy for rural development must be based on agriculture' s internal potential while at the same time developing as many other activities as possible in order to prevent the desertification of the rural world.	47.715205020200884
This is why we considered it essential to improve the report by means of our proposals deliberately to include agricultural activity and farmers in the strategy for rural development and to request more appropriations in order not to threaten the survival of the programme in those rural regions which were covered before. We also want to ensure that the new programme continues to prioritise the less-favoured regions.	50.36905953989148
Our position on LEADER is a product of our more general assessment of the EU' s overall agricultural policy.	49.470285395753635
Both LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, which were implemented in the 1990s, were ingredients of the new CAP that emerged after its review in 1992 and, along with other respective measures, they constituted the so-termed second pillar of the EU' s rural development policy.	114.97094577276225
Their real aim was to moderate and disguise the new CAP' s disastrous consequences and the disorientation of small and medium-scale farmers, and not to develop the rural areas or retain the agricultural population therein as was hypocritically declared in their objectives.	77.84677931310105
This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented, farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly, which resulted in their depopulation.	78.42614428724019
A characteristic example is Greece, which as an Objective 1 country was included as a whole in the LEADER Community initiatives, and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reached approximately 2.3%, while between 1994 and 1999 farming incomes decreased by 15.2%.	103.06902039618546
We think LEADER + will be even more ineffectual than LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, for the following reasons.	151.7741716817281
The real aims of LEADER + are the same as those of LEADERs 1 and 2, in other words to moderate and disguise the negative consequences of the CAP to be implemented in the context of Agenda 2000 and the WTO.	67.9272442459137
The present CAP, however, is worse than its predecessor and it also starts from a worse basis, granted that the 1992 CAP review and the GATT agreement in 1995 have created serious problems and impasses for the agricultural economy.	99.69976449407702
The selection criteria and the activities that are subsidised under LEADER do, in the best case, moderate some partial problems of the countryside, which are of secondary importance, but in the worst case they degenerate into expenditure for the sake of public relations and pandering to conscience.	81.53582232392351
In no case, however, are they programmes for the integrated development of the selected areas and they do not create permanent jobs in the countryside because most of the activities there are not productive in nature.	74.0284911833105
The actual appropriations available for LEADER + compared with LEADER 2 are smaller despite their increase by 15% (from EUR 1 775 million for LEADER 2 to EUR 2 020 million for LEADER +).	146.08498723069175
This is because the 15% increase is nominal and not real, granted that average yearly inflation in the Community during those years was approximately 2%.	139.12493642050012
startTok LEADER + will last a year longer than LEADER 2. endTok	619.0661703950825
startTok LEADER + can cover all the regions of the EU, while LEADER 2 covered only the Objective 1 regions and some Objective 5b and 6 regions. endTok	167.6553015628553
startTok We must point out, however, that even if the actual appropriations available for LEADER + were increased, the Community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programmes cannot compensate for or blunt the anti-farming nature of the CAP that will be implemented in the context of 'Agenda 2000' and the WTO. The real outcome of such programmes is to act as a cover-up, to lead people off the scent and to salve consciences. endTok	81.16022174847677
startTok We disagree with many of the report' s views. endTok	36.71737318006693
startTok Once more, we point to the negative changes of the CAP (1992 - Agenda 2000). endTok	209.24929985134472
startTok We do not think LEADER + will contribute substantively towards solving the countryside' s problems, which are characterised by the decline of farming, which was and should remain the countryside' s basic social and economic branch. endTok	84.21603749405301
startTok For our part, we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes. endTok	43.91585595295571
startTok We will make every effort to improve them as much as possible and prevent them from being wasted, and most important of all, we will try to foster the struggle of farmers against the disastrous CAP which is disinheriting them and leading them towards economic decline and the desertion of the countryside. endTok	52.815464049535535
startTok Unless this CAP is overthrown, no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-scale farmers and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside. endTok	61.96686388249555
startTok All the Members in the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voted in favour of almost the whole of the Procacci report on the LEADER + Community Initiative. endTok	35.77845326413752
startTok However, we amended the draft report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to clarify certain points which will make this Community initiative more effective. endTok	33.85914642641674
startTok In particular we felt it was necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedures which proved to be too cumbersome and slow in the LEADER II initiative. endTok	51.108796388862515
startTok It was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of LEADER + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density. endTok	79.53239606593195
startTok Amendment No 10 which I tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of 'economic and social cohesion' rather than 'regional development' as the European Union does not have any recognised competence in this area. endTok	28.934346076278562
startTok Amendment No 11 replaces 'government or municipal officials' with 'government officials' . endTok	124.05505276375106
startTok Although local action groups should consist of a balanced and representative selection of partners drawn from the different socio-economic sectors of the territory concerned, government officials must be involved at decision-making level, whether they come from the municipalities, departments, regions or national governments. endTok	114.46408181938315
startTok The rapporteur' s phrasing was therefore too limiting. endTok	75.68540132846869
startTok Amendment No 12 responds to the expectations of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of this House. endTok	14.986281268255214
startTok It specifies the necessary coordination between LEADER + and Community cooperation and partnership programmes such as INTERREG, PHARE, Sapard or MEDA. endTok	80.08481051179035
startTok In the territory of Member States of the European Union, applicant countries or Member States of EFTA, there may be interrelations between the various Community initiatives. endTok	28.100719025496083
startTok The real priority for the European continent is to establish an operational level within a European framework and not a global framework as proposed by the rapporteur. endTok	52.871100434696174
startTok The creation of organisations similar to the LAGs may be usefully encouraged by the European Union, provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners. endTok	36.3279952521322
startTok In essence, we are, of course, in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative. endTok	29.047896627862784
startTok The conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union' s priorities since it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric, including infrastructure, public and private services and so on. endTok	71.85273129428494
startTok In this context, in committee we regretted the paltry funding allotted to rural development and supported the amendments calling for an increased budget for this Community initiative so that it matches the previous LEADER I and LEADER II initiatives. endTok	77.44332918051448
startTok The budget allocated to LEADER + for a period of seven years is half that allocated to LEADER II for a period of six years. endTok	105.3420562744789
startTok This is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid specified in the reform of the CAP following the Berlin agreements. endTok	69.50795801630517
startTok Finally, among the priority parameters to be introduced at European level to enable local involvement, particular attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects which have already been implemented by LAGs within the LEADER II initiative, but which could not be concluded due to the timetable and weight of the management mechanisms specified. endTok	72.19420774231546

startTok Additives in feedingstuffs endTok	192.88055911884626
startTok The next item is the report (A5-0015/2000) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs (COM(1999) 388 - C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168(CNS)). endTok	4.978806865545509
startTok Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, under Directive 70/524, high-technology additives are treated differently, depending on the date of authorisation. endTok	97.91649546844376
startTok The Commission has proposed harmonising the authorisation procedure so that substances licensed before 1988 are put on an equal footing with substances authorised now. endTok	90.02799160441006
startTok As far as we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned, so far so good. endTok	22.823864188519767
startTok However, the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics, drugs, growth-promoters and genetically-modified organisms. endTok	74.21546143953357
startTok That makes it a question of health, not just approximating laws, which is why we in the Committee on Agriculture take the view that the legal base - Article 37 - is not admissible here and that the Commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of Article 152, that is to say with codecision by Parliament. endTok	50.59515301840622
startTok We asked the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which pointed out that, as far as approximating laws is concerned, Article 37 is adequate in this case. endTok	29.86545699221955
startTok However, we in the Committee on Agriculture have not confined ourselves to approximating laws; because this proposal also encompasses genetically-modified organisms, we have tabled a further proposed amendment which affects the content and hence public health. endTok	71.52293022536111
startTok We negotiated with the Commission for two years on the seed directive and came to a compromise regulating the release of genetically-modified organisms in the directive, taking the text on which Directive 70/524 is based as a starting point. endTok	52.75899311370046
startTok Mr Byrne, we fail to understand why the Commission is not approximating the text on genetically-modified organisms as part of its harmonisation work. endTok	54.49021399346374
startTok We have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text. endTok	42.60300340219482
startTok Moreover, this text has also been adopted in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently needs to be adopted in this directive as well. endTok	43.71008400387195
startTok The Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future. endTok	49.809869074344505
startTok However, that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives. endTok	28.95112805836084
startTok We are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to genetically-modified organisms. endTok	35.31062642204298
startTok Directive 70/524 still contains the old text because the seed directive was submitted to Parliament in 1986 and we then negotiated with the Commission until 1988, while the report on this directive was dealt with in 1994 and Parliament obviously did not accord genetically-modified organisms the same importance then as it did later when I was rapporteur. endTok	111.31597509650825
startTok We therefore assume, Commissioner Byrne, that you too will accept our proposed amendment of the legal base. endTok	64.9947431928935
startTok If you do not, we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you, exactly as we did with the seed directive. I should point out that the text which we have now worked out is a valid compromise, both for your legal service and ours. endTok	93.77746192003531
startTok In other words, we do not need to re-negotiate the text; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive. endTok	40.5019054034374
startTok I can hardly wait, Commissioner Byrne, to hear what you have to say to our proposals. endTok	31.15360704875924
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, does regulating additives in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy? endTok	84.11389906156016
startTok As far the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee are concerned, it comes under competition. endTok	38.3477315736734
startTok Of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988. endTok	68.85335088059425
startTok We want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and Mr Doyle' s proposed Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support. endTok	69.35222347253882
startTok However, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has said in his report, this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter. endTok	28.44617313147461
startTok Food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions. endTok	114.78984563812749
startTok When we talk of transparency in the food chain, that applies from the hayfork to the table fork and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs. endTok	64.41884581064826
startTok The antibiotics, growth promoters and genetically-modified organisms mixed in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain. endTok	105.33336666873062
startTok The dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction. endTok	47.32370431183436
startTok According to Article 152 of the EC Treaty, we are obliged to obviate sources of danger to human health, whereby the accent is clearly on sources. endTok	42.675385134727335
startTok Consequently, we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger, i.e. harmful additives in feedingstuffs. endTok	76.89993091832586
startTok Otherwise, in my view, we are beavering away at the symptoms, but not the causes. endTok	59.33998869660727
startTok People are especially wary of GMOs. endTok	127.09889165735275
startTok We must confront increasing public awareness of GMOs by regulating their use in feedingstuffs accordingly. endTok	146.32767069582394
startTok First, if an additive consists of or contains genetically-modified organisms, then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment. endTok	79.50266920547533
startTok Secondly, it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically-modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation, as the rapporteur has said. endTok	94.8102926347401
startTok And thirdly, if we are to have a transparent consumer policy, we need to label genetically-modified feedingstuffs. endTok	56.66223528597236
startTok A clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice, both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer. endTok	115.04212729878324
startTok Responsible citizens should, in my view, have a choice. endTok	157.5923107965171
startTok We all talk of scandalised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety. endTok	50.04745898793611
startTok By regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently, we can help significantly to restore confidence. endTok	132.9913463984815
startTok I too, therefore, can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments. endTok	28.153092690180124
startTok Consequently, we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be. endTok	182.30382225130342
startTok Mr President, this proposal to amend the 1970 directive on additives in feedingstuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feedingstuffs. endTok	30.66700300451668
startTok In other words, we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months. endTok	31.058419535157388
startTok That this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin, antibiotic, sludge and other scandals have attracted. endTok	84.16392939934873
startTok In other words, this is an important facet of public health protection, which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base, not Article 37, as proposed by the Commission. endTok	29.11668641507477
startTok The amendment which the Commission has proposed, namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 December 1987, is uncontested and has our full support. endTok	65.18556101083075
startTok However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal. endTok	30.16417835499546
startTok The regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives. endTok	49.114441615068806
startTok Only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded. endTok	96.45283445519824
startTok This sort of monopoly, which could lead, for example, to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs, should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 April 1998. endTok	55.44639078633246
startTok This would then apply until the re-assessment procedure has been completed. endTok	84.5771009095621
startTok The most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion, as recommended by the rapporteur, of genetically-modified organisms in the directive on additives, taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point. endTok	58.99637637387739
startTok This already gives us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs. endTok	70.27727989957056
startTok It is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case, just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas, such as forest reproductive material, to mention just one example. endTok	60.96785719875947
startTok The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect. endTok	38.977976011059006
startTok On the one hand, it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and, on the other hand, it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using GMOs. endTok	90.16138391664774
startTok Finally, our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur, who has gone to a great deal of trouble. endTok	27.16270991580009
startTok I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne' s reply. endTok	38.80294483016138
startTok Mr President, the report deals mainly with formalities, in other words, the manner in which additives will be authorised. It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work. endTok	76.36715477509253
startTok I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that, in future, all the directives are dealt with under Article 152, since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview. endTok	36.55277214425412
startTok We cannot carry on as we have done up until now, that is to say dealing with each detail on its own, often only after the harm has already been done. endTok	86.61165270570059
startTok The rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of GMOs in feed additives. endTok	117.63400184392351
startTok However, I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics. endTok	20.154248457400076
startTok Certainly, five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned. endTok	105.77266023048908
startTok It is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four, both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves. endTok	45.95673344153089
startTok We now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people's health, particularly in the case of small children. endTok	61.42886677302556
startTok A number of Member States are already able to show conclusively that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary. endTok	39.767895092513086
startTok Several countries phased out antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same. endTok	94.96236214524649
startTok We talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but, in the case of antibiotics, it has long since been forgotten. endTok	60.88523320774567
startTok However, there is another environmental principle at stake, namely the exchange principle. endTok	110.76182798103143
startTok I should like to say a few words about coccidiostats. endTok	10.268403116759307
startTok They are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary. endTok	35.10001477589419
startTok There is a substitute, which is used to vaccinate chickens. endTok	19.921762078367173
startTok Although it is a little more expensive, it does not harm the environment. endTok	27.419469020013956
startTok Coccidiostats now accompany the manure that is spread on the fields. In that way, they end up in our water supplies which, as we all know, are our most vital resource. endTok	72.92058801691971
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives. endTok	52.84012530921146
startTok Yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition. endTok	101.69215378986586
startTok You may recall, even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public, that the Commission' s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin-loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit imported from Brazil. endTok	73.42812869561905
startTok We must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals. endTok	60.693255311002055
startTok Incidentally, it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our dogs, cats and other domestic animals. endTok	55.64861968248732
startTok Is it because of cut-throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri-foodstuffs industry? endTok	73.20930740101085
startTok Such a serious issue cannot be limited to a technical debate, even though it is the directive itself which limits the authorisation of antibiotics and other growth promoters. endTok	61.07391583225696
startTok The precautions which we are preparing to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our plates. endTok	62.738699948453814
startTok As forcefully underlined by this report, labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock. endTok	63.030941215836656
startTok He must also know whether his bag of protein granules includes GMOs as these components could represent a risk to public health. endTok	82.94309054077611
startTok In any case, the precautionary principle requires these products to be clearly traceable at all stages of their marketing. endTok	48.571565243825894
startTok However, before labelling we need clear rules. endTok	174.57467061544514
startTok Straight questions must be asked about the real end-use of animal meal, for example. endTok	175.207969123064
startTok Although we are looking at all the problems caused by these products in ethical and health terms, it is their use which must be questioned today. endTok	57.68287010579601
startTok In this respect, the chapter of the White Paper on food safety which deals with feedingstuffs must serve as a working basis for going beyond mere commercial questions. endTok	58.05079467383637
startTok The Commission has on many occasions used the farm-to-table example which our colleague in the PPE Group has just underlined. endTok	82.81224265892861
startTok This is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and, to do this, the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time. endTok	30.460549296506645
startTok This is why it is essential to approve Amendment No 2 to Recital 4 which avoids the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an additive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re-evaluation procedure. endTok	61.628431470495215
startTok Also, Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2a must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such, thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions. endTok	95.55061844958614
startTok Mr President, because of the availability of high-technology additives in the feedingstuffs industry, detailed information on their use is needed from the actors, and as we know there are a lot of them, so that we can put a stop to practices which infringe Community law. endTok	45.62911099250894
startTok This directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own. endTok	86.0063424881213
startTok Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them. endTok	42.394851175269224
startTok Up the point at which meat, milk, bread and other products are sold over the shop counter, feedingstuffs and additives are structured, mixed, blended, cut and transported several times. endTok	143.83345432950253
startTok The fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems, just as it does in the foodstuffs industry. endTok	125.56897693621731
startTok The negative consequences are well known, the positive ones less so. endTok	184.83796212250522
startTok I am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of European citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region. endTok	47.04810269170179
startTok However, more work is needed on this. endTok	56.278390333534595
startTok Mr President, may I commence by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on his report. endTok	11.071812835569446
startTok It reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the area of food safety and quality. endTok	51.44076130032554
startTok The events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health. endTok	48.25437705521052
startTok The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future, for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform. endTok	88.38066407199591
startTok But even in this crucial area of administration, Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility. endTok	79.89379610720236
startTok In Agenda 2000, we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens: food safety, water quality, environmental protection and rural development. endTok	79.8916246458628
startTok If we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence, the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people-focused and very much reflect community needs. endTok	82.39111189662987
startTok I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds. endTok	98.54428852425215
startTok Those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely. endTok	81.92194993773185
startTok I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety, Mr Byrne. endTok	72.57616030839196
startTok He has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House, as well as to the concern of consumers. endTok	48.42185389795125
startTok I am particularly pleased that my own country, Ireland, is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability. endTok	35.61491942670041
startTok This will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production. endTok	54.73943912506038
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group. endTok	20.55899874826875
startTok It is therefore specified that, through the adoption of a regulation, the Commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation. This will occur at the same time for all the additives in question. endTok	53.51984240207784
startTok A coherent legal framework must be re-established. endTok	94.8117393360338
startTok As of October 1999 the Commission proposed introducing a legal basis into Directive 70/524/EEC for the replacement of the authorisations. endTok	40.11041737593335
startTok However, we must ensure that competition distortions are not created, as highlighted by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi. endTok	28.561409922748854
startTok Genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this. endTok	90.07247671597695
startTok The consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision. endTok	86.3443616384694
startTok This proposal has no financial consequences for the Community budget. endTok	29.346121886517825
startTok There must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety. endTok	40.27482697932854
startTok I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which, as you know, was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. endTok	17.706049732484402
startTok Mr President, we have said in this House time and again since the BSE crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection. endTok	61.95554799227488
startTok We therefore welcome the Commission' s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs. endTok	21.07394680537903
startTok The Committee on behalf of which I am speaking, namely the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, decided in December, on the assumption that the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture would draft such a good report, that we could waive our opinion. endTok	32.581825563385436
startTok Nevertheless, I should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points. endTok	20.809625610835116
startTok First, perhaps, I should say something on the question of the legal base. endTok	37.604871676390985
startTok Even if we have new Rules of Procedure in Parliament, and it may well be that, with such an ambitious chairman in the Committee on Agriculture, problems of legislative competence will arise more and more frequently between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment, one thing is always crystal clear for me in this sort of conflict: cohesion in this Parliament is crucial and the legal basis of a question is crucial as far as I am concerned. endTok	55.67840028814384
startTok Therefore, and I must address this comment to you Mr Byrne, I reject your choice of legal basis. endTok	85.30391906644726
startTok If it is merely a hand-me-down legal basis taken over from previous directives, then it is a mistake to keep it. endTok	236.26924401285663
startTok The Treaty of Amsterdam states quite clearly that, where people' s health is concerned, Article 152 is the correct legal base, and may I say to our own Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it is simply not good enough to look at the Commission' s proposal and say, there is nothing in it about health and consumer protection, so it has nothing to do with health and consumer protection. endTok	46.887814189815174
startTok My group, as Mr Kindermann has already said, will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and I hope that other groups in this House will do likewise. endTok	37.98995226130264
startTok Mr Byrne, I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation. endTok	49.88851192548851
startTok If we do not change it and we follow the Legal Affairs Committee, we shall be opening the floodgates to manipulation. endTok	34.34254006813544
startTok The Commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by excluding any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an Article 37. endTok	69.45733246449467
startTok Allow me to comment briefly on two other points. First, genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs. endTok	46.85885853694514
startTok We cannot just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law. endTok	108.38538595541064
startTok We do not have another law at the moment, and until we do, we must deal with genetically-modified micro-organisms as and when we pass legislation; we must include them as an add-on and insist that they be labelled. endTok	65.52808993795074
startTok The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign. endTok	45.011108854534115
startTok I say now, as I have said on numerous occasions in the past: yes, I too would like the Commission to propose a positive list which we can then debate and deal with in this House, but we do at least need a starting point for a positive list of additives in feedingstuffs. endTok	41.287944815470205
startTok It is equally important to have strict hygiene requirements for the manufacture of additives and for proper controls to be carried out in the Member States. endTok	33.293304536431364
startTok There are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet. endTok	37.06320302578012
startTok Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report. endTok	4.0651399779934625
startTok This is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future. endTok	15.737288243213372
startTok What has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers. endTok	53.87545662535277
startTok We must strike a balance between them. endTok	20.892272594693914
startTok We must resolve this issue, because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat. endTok	35.40641791490155
startTok One way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned. endTok	82.6858592786438
startTok GMOs are the new challenge facing us. endTok	73.94678258536018
startTok This is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so: I myself share these concerns. endTok	73.81404003025767
startTok But I think we should not allow our concerns about GMOs to overshadow our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed. endTok	73.37828673672827
startTok Indeed, we should not allow GMOs to obscure the fact that meat and bonemeal are still included in animal feeds in many countries in Europe. endTok	25.21803886719095
startTok One factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition - competition between Member States on the cost of the production of food. endTok	88.64529723893469
startTok These are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field: food must be of the same standard in all Member States. endTok	54.71858776034682
startTok We have had the dioxin scare, BSE and many other problems. endTok	51.871144622465984
startTok The main problem is a financial one, namely who bears the cost? endTok	83.65738257835744
startTok The problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer: the producer has been forced to bear all the cost. endTok	37.05846693428025
startTok We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred. endTok	38.910436775394686
startTok We must also ensure that the food that is imported into the European Union meets the standards within the European Union. endTok	36.96310538091525
startTok If we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future. endTok	53.44232978843273
startTok . I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur, the committee chairman, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for examining the Commission's proposal. endTok	16.3887651830527
startTok The Commission proposal is, as some of you have said, rather technical. endTok	58.18062407350819
startTok Nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective: to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives. endTok	149.81837584581547
startTok At present there is a difference in treatment between authorisations, depending on whether applications were submitted before or after 1 January 1988. endTok	100.27121703067294
startTok The purpose of the Commission's proposal is to harmonise procedures to ensure that no such difference exists. endTok	43.05590262653037
startTok The scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited. endTok	28.861362618620287
startTok Five amendments have been presented by Parliament. endTok	56.333403405313675
startTok I regret that the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments, despite the fact that I am fully aware of the views and commitment of Parliament, the Agricultural Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on these issues. endTok	23.251761703042494
startTok I shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately. endTok	50.93585144148019
startTok The first amendment proposes to change the legal base of the proposal by replacing Article 37 with Article 152. endTok	53.76423191581738
startTok I would simply point out that the Commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection. endTok	30.99464741684449
startTok The proposed amendment is technical and cannot be interpreted as having as its primary objective the protection of public health. endTok	55.92161922584176
startTok I note that Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also accepts that Article 37 is the appropriate legal base. endTok	23.444851688534225
startTok I remind Parliament that in Article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health. endTok	79.08886472004411
startTok I commend to you the arguments set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee which sets out the position, in my view, with precision, clarity and commendable brevity. endTok	46.96244814196022
startTok Amendments Nos 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission proposal since they aim to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives. endTok	65.79387674142615
startTok I am the first to accept that GMOs are a very important issue. endTok	29.729495671188232
startTok I also accept and acknowledge that a number of initiatives to update EU legislation in the field of GMOs are necessary. endTok	44.083911793145646
startTok However, this technical amendment is not the correct instrument to introduce such initiatives. endTok	92.81432801872319
startTok The Commission is of the view that it is premature to amend the rules currently laid down by Directive 70/524 on genetically modified additives at this stage. endTok	33.83292047731653
startTok Instead it is appropriate to await developments in relation to the common position on the amendment to Directive 90/220, which is currently in second reading in Parliament. endTok	52.727128253235726
startTok The Commission envisages going much further than is currently proposed by Parliament in its amendments. endTok	72.22622998125709
startTok I can also assure Parliament that I will ensure that the pertinent provisions of Directive 90/220 are included in the proposal for a recasting of Directive 70/524 that the Commission has proposed in the White Paper on food safety to present to Parliament before July 2001. endTok	26.52005955706136
startTok I can also assure Parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account. endTok	33.997729894478525
startTok Amendments Nos 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they give undue preference to copy products by granting them authorisation to be placed into circulation even before an application for authorisation has been submitted. endTok	80.6128425963293
startTok The Commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations. endTok	138.8626105651561
startTok I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additives in feedingstuffs to address wider issues. endTok	41.43975889969332
startTok I should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate. endTok	20.116443424025757
startTok First of all, regarding the observations made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of GMO additives in the Additives Directive 70/524, and not in the Novel Feed Directive. endTok	42.871195575219595
startTok This is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives. endTok	89.42246737284017
startTok The text taken by Parliament is from the Directive which was adopted in 1998. endTok	50.48028869633134
startTok But the vertical legislation in Directive 90/220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing. endTok	107.29294085200365
startTok It is before Parliament for second reading. endTok	61.91845346093556
startTok It is my belief that we should await the final outcome of Directive 90/220 and in particular, Article 11. endTok	40.44541622860525
startTok Reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies. endTok	34.794927572479864
startTok Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi made reference to this. endTok	30.344044741283067
startTok There are just a few points I should like to make on that issue. endTok	30.35823507757681
startTok First of all, this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993, so it has not really been sprung on any other commodity producers. endTok	46.254682963483106
startTok Indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product. endTok	115.30540950497468
startTok I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives. endTok	45.261179195613174
startTok Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base, whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152. endTok	56.27737058892025
startTok I again refer to what I said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the House that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify any measure based on Article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health. endTok	59.289530968621825
startTok This is an issue that has been looked at on at least two separate occasions by the European Court of Justice, which has laid down the legal criteria for situations such as this where the appropriate legal base has to be properly taken into account when putting forward legislation. endTok	53.104018712151564
startTok The jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this. endTok	25.154849167214316
startTok As an overall comment to the suggested amendments here, particularly in relation to the legal base issue, it would be inappropriate, in my opinion, to change the legal base to Article 152 in these circumstances, as it would be very likely to fall foul of the objective criteria that have been laid down by the Court. endTok	56.53347578151642
startTok A number of you made reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling. endTok	68.70524183445751
startTok Directive 70/524 foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives. endTok	66.80149649695383
startTok It is already included now: "indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products". endTok	67.02116779786786
startTok So this issue will be addressed. endTok	33.60970463430543
startTok That formula enabled us to oblige applicants to put on the label the fact that genetic modification techniques have been used in the product, the subject matter of the application. endTok	71.22153502233073
startTok Mr President, allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question. endTok	22.489516532073594
startTok First allow me to point out, Commissioner Byrne, that the European Parliament has no right of legislative initiative. endTok	34.8332501719129
startTok But we do reserve the right, when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation, to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have singled out. endTok	69.47203922890694
startTok Nonetheless, we have confined ourselves in our proposed amendments to bringing the text into line with that of other directives and we have disregarded the question of content. endTok	61.08489593096003
startTok For example, you did not go into antibiotics. endTok	51.60652406684934
startTok We are therefore talking about harmonising the legal provisions in the individual directives. endTok	39.44989649425722
startTok My question, Commissioner Byrne is this: the UN conference in Montreal decided that genetically-modified organisms must be labelled for international trade. endTok	76.10385806406495
startTok Do you really believe that, if we could, Parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the European Union? endTok	67.2424271840308
startTok Commissioner Byrne, it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with Parliament. endTok	34.61568813069608
startTok We negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years. endTok	105.17216146658129
startTok I look forward to the next round. endTok	18.265095067943815
startTok . I would stress that no GMOs have been approved under this directive; it applies only to additives. endTok	93.17901481568629
startTok I would also say in relation to the questions surrounding labelling that this is a complex issue. endTok	33.275996820659174
startTok It is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way, particularly in Directive 90/220. endTok	41.34443769723051
startTok This issue is before Parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it, which will also come under the legal base of Article 152 which gives Parliament full competence in the areas of codecision. endTok	89.03477496095209
startTok I would assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it is by no means my intention or wish to have any clash or test of strength with Parliament on this issue. endTok	46.52029052027995
startTok It is my intention, as it has always been, to work in cooperation with Parliament, to ensure that the results we achieve are the very best results. endTok	48.6415494292941
startTok The best way of dealing with this issue is through the draft legislation before Parliament at the moment, as well as the legislation in the pipeline, rather than in this technical document and in circumstances where the questions that are set out and to be debated in Directive 90/220 may not be fully taken into account. endTok	49.16055300213411
startTok It is best to wait for that debate which, I understand, will take place fairly soon. endTok	57.258545879400685
startTok All of these matters will be addressed in that legislation. endTok	44.17085555800466
startTok Thank you, Commissioner. endTok	17.829155313593716
startTok Parliament has taken due note of your comments. endTok	29.15313366664453
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. endTok	4.628394244073071
startTok Scrapie endTok	897.5084503102427
startTok The next item is the report (A5-0023/2000) by Mr Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/68/EC as regards scrapie (COM(1998) 623 - C4-0026/1999 - 1998/0324(COD)). endTok	6.985061978116003
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was and always will be one of life' s mysteries, one of the unsolved riddles of the follow-up to the BSE crisis, that we still have no Community rules for the control of scrapie in sheep. endTok	32.58073027792535
startTok In this respect, the Commission' s proposals to amend directive 91/68 and delete the reference to scrapie and the report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the detection and control of TSE infections in general, comply with Parliament' s demands in the wake of the follow-up report by the BSE committee of inquiry and we expressly welcome this. endTok	37.3522368762584
startTok I should, however, like to add that no new scientific knowledge was needed which proved that the experimental infection of sheep by feeding them BSE-infected feed produced a clinical expression of the disease which is indistinguishable from the symptoms of scrapie. endTok	66.33827284546526
startTok No new knowledge was needed, because the theory from the beginning was that BSE and scrapie must be related and this theory has increasingly taken hold. endTok	145.1169568375709
startTok From this point of view we are slightly behind the times. endTok	68.7267365513607
startTok I am therefore in complete agreement with the Commission' s proposal on scrapie. endTok	26.473147429056198
startTok I should, however, like to add that it only makes sense if we ensure that the new TSE regulation allows a reasonable symbiosis between consumer protection and practicable suggestions. endTok	47.38127055015988
startTok We therefore need to take consistent account of six or seven points in the coming debate on the TSE proposal, and that of course includes scrapie. endTok	50.06254361727334
startTok When we discuss the TSE regulation, Commissioner, we must also clarify that we shortly intend to discuss separate proposals under Article 152 as the corresponding legal base for products excluded from this regulation, such as cosmetics, medicinal products or animal feed. endTok	92.75433448997684
startTok We insist on this. endTok	34.625733517195755
startTok As far as I am concerned, that means that fundamental core provisions in this proposed regulation must not be relegated yet again to the Annex but included in the body of the proposed regulation because we here in Parliament want to and will assume joint responsibility here. endTok	101.19841277231684
startTok It also means that, when we are fighting these diseases, the problem of destroying whole herds in the event of an outbreak of scrapie or BSE and the question of defining geographical areas are items which also remain on the agenda. endTok	67.36701369475593
startTok Although I welcome the fact that the fight against scrapie is included in the TSE regulation, I feel that the Commission' s proposals for fighting scrapie are still not consistent enough and I shall submit amendments on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development to tighten up the proposals when the Roth-Behrendt report is debated. endTok	41.530022018668944
startTok I should also like to address two other points. We expressly welcome the regional classification of the status of Member States as regards outbreaks of scrapie or TSEs. endTok	57.08851002553506
startTok Here again the Commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by Parliament. endTok	36.73660222573295
startTok Finally, in discussing the question of the future application of tests, we should of course bear in mind that we have still not reached the point where tests are generally applicable. endTok	56.59621315808673
startTok But the tests available now are perfectly able to guarantee security in consumer health policy, albeit not for every individual animal. endTok	212.44550182431365
startTok But when we need to consider if a region can move from a negative epidemiological status to a better category, an epidemiological inspection of the situation in a region in the form of suitable sampling in abattoirs using such tests can provide useful pointers in the political and scientific debate as to where there is a need for preventive consumer protection and, basically, where such tests can be used to help us settle disputes on a proper basis. endTok	83.41281035568272
startTok I would be grateful, Commissioner, if you would take these passing comments on board in the report on scrapie and in the general report on the fight against TSEs and bear in mind that we shall be calling you to account on these points. endTok	53.09278960612739
startTok Mr President, over the years, the following situation has arisen: one subject has developed into a subject of many facets. endTok	88.30656528987926
startTok Many of us here in this House have spent years, whether we intended to or not, dealing solely with the consequences of the BSE scandal right down to the last detail. endTok	89.23798428789198
startTok And it is still on the agenda today. endTok	68.3703565086216
startTok It is therefore hardly surprising that I and Mr Böge are talking about it and that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just mentioned it in his report. endTok	27.626650344969107
startTok The cast is always the same. endTok	52.3298761350514
startTok Although the cause was unfortunate, it was certainly not the worst experience of this Parliament. endTok	64.9483029210792
startTok My task as draftsman of the opinion of the Environment Committee is a very simple one. endTok	36.8530316507187
startTok I agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the Environment Committee has asked the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to agree to the Commission proposal. endTok	24.220112429549555
startTok That saves a great deal of time which I would like to use for other things and which I shall use now somewhat in anticipation, as Mr Böge has just done. endTok	56.66328902348112
startTok I have yet to submit my report on TSEs to the House. endTok	82.53782269600451
startTok At first we were somewhat irresolute and we regret that now. endTok	81.78175419572287
startTok But I have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing. endTok	18.467964077273166
startTok This debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity, Mr Byrne, to give the Commission a few things to think about. endTok	43.06185692794271
startTok Although we did not have a very positive exchange on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf' s report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree, things may be different with this report. endTok	40.74186055360266
startTok Allow me to say from the outset that the part of the complex report which Mr Böge dealt with - and this form of collaboration between two committees, with one leading committee and the other giving an opinion and vice versa, worked very well and could perhaps be used as a model for the future - is relatively simple. endTok	65.88919404152522
startTok It will become more difficult once we see the TSE proposal, Mr Byrne. endTok	106.55208619388624
startTok When we have the chance to ask direct questions, the questions which Mr Böge referred to will be asked. endTok	64.3018884839024
startTok Questions will be asked - questions which I shall have to put to you and the Commission representatives in committee - on how things stand with the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries. endTok	50.491181943527366
startTok How will BSE status in fact be defined then? endTok	239.33112491873965
startTok Do you envisage circumstances under which the BSE status will depend on the willingness to apply a BSE test? endTok	89.08344178894451
startTok And then there is my standing question to you Mr Byrne, a question you certainly already know and which will not surprise you. What about the BSE test? endTok	114.92895946813181
startTok When will you make it compulsory? endTok	72.91460760786175
startTok Perhaps you will do so before Parliament debates the TSE report. endTok	133.57732184576545
startTok Not that I want to put it off, but it would be a gesture, as it were, if you could say: here is the proposed legislation on the BSE test. endTok	61.74623776210006
startTok I know that I am a thorn in your side on this, but sometimes that is my job. endTok	40.09825499685017
startTok I say quite emphatically, even after the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, who is completely involved in the whole idea, that animal feeding, animal rearing, animal production must be suited to the species and must also, above all, cause no harm or danger to human beings. endTok	55.180736631171264
startTok Cosmetic, medical and other products cannot be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous. endTok	90.37819639109965
startTok That is, without doubt, too short, too sweet and too little. endTok	110.64163268035698
startTok You are lucky that Mr Böge' s report only deals with this on the sidelines; with my report you will have to justify yourself more thoroughly and you will have more trouble doing so. endTok	63.07170964573845
startTok Finally, just one more brief comment, Mr Byrne. endTok	157.86442320910223
startTok We have a new Commission. endTok	39.496735891601894
startTok Whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this Commission and the President of the Commission, only time will tell. endTok	44.69303004708322
startTok But there is one thing we certainly will not let you get away with and I am sure that, as a lawyer and politician you will understand this. Important issues cannot be regulated in annexes. endTok	43.020922343726575
startTok They belong in the legislative text. I might do the same if I were a Commissioner, because I could simply change an annex under a comitology procedure and I would not always need to work with Parliament, which takes so long and is so difficult. endTok	81.07744554106003
startTok But you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this. endTok	33.71972093437756
startTok In other words, whenever I get the chance, I shall take everything out of the annexes and cram it into the legislative text. endTok	63.31110819357253
startTok And you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset. endTok	30.885369498786154
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to remind you of the composition of our food chain and how important it is for this chain to provide us with safe, healthy food which is produced, as a matter of principle, without any questionable or risky interim or end products. endTok	56.870173238745984
startTok Over recent years, these basic principles have often been neglected in animal husbandry and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or greed. endTok	48.84109052990495
startTok The European Parliament has already taken a clear stand on BSE and I think that we should do likewise on all epidemics in animals. endTok	41.19011495980157
startTok We should not allow food safety to be compromised because, in the final analysis, it is our health which is at stake. endTok	27.900623717317952
startTok The Commission' s proposal encompasses both the transportation and the placing on the market of sheep and goats and a Community regulation to fight scrapie. endTok	36.42543505391526
startTok This is even more important given that there is no clear proof that BSE and scrapie are unrelated. endTok	44.9526709626602
startTok Animals are bought throughout Europe and transported over the entire continent. endTok	101.73614427397666
startTok The spread of an epidemic as the result of bringing in one sick animal can have huge consequences for farmers. endTok	93.65099934963007
startTok And I should point out that, for the first time in history, a case of scrapie was detected in Austria about four weeks ago. endTok	52.0442995409175
startTok Scrapie is a particularly insidious disease because the pathogen can remain active in dust for years and is then ingested in food. endTok	64.84556464785628
startTok The disease is always fatal. endTok	26.161444854776615
startTok As there is no vaccination, farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie. endTok	91.39001632488123
startTok Even if scrapie cannot be passed on to human beings, the connection with BSE has still not been clarified, as I have already said. endTok	57.414548943413024
startTok As a farmer myself, I am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk. endTok	48.46352498634388
startTok I am in favour of preventive measures, starting with feeding which is suitable for the species, rather than measures to combat an epidemic once it has broken out. endTok	56.832735868492705
startTok I therefore welcome the Commission' s initiative to create a new legal base for combating scrapie. endTok	25.052138334789973
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Böge' s report on measures to prevent TSE diseases is based on the proposals of the European Parliament' s temporary BSE Committee. endTok	42.98247583130489
startTok Mr Böge was responsible for some invaluable work on this committee, and it is a relief to see that the job of monitoring the work of the BSE Committee in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has fallen to him: he is the one with the experience. endTok	55.70538114592707
startTok I would have liked my speech to be part of a discussion that would have also treated the second part of the Commission' s proposal. endTok	32.35492043777202
startTok I do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is featured in the plenary session. endTok	25.36119725490104
startTok In the previous speech Mrs Schierhuber said that scrapies is an insidious disease. endTok	31.404416261327444
startTok It is indeed. endTok	38.63921865258021
startTok For me as a Finn, and a member who has been active in matters concerning agriculture and the health and transportation of animals, it is most important that those EU states where TSEs do not occur at all will in the future too be guaranteed the right to inspect as fully as is necessary the transportation of live animals. endTok	85.41768449960054
startTok I wish to stress how important it is for us to remain free of disease. endTok	36.891105408513184
startTok The possibility, if necessary, of having additional inspections of animals in these areas is not a question of artificial protectionism or the restriction of freedom of movement, as there really is justification for it. endTok	103.7891711314893
startTok The inspections must be seen as being fair and cost-effective action to promote the wellbeing of animals and prevent increased expenditure for the EU. endTok	85.91518232535026
startTok On behalf of the European Liberal Democrats, we can support the Commission' s proposal on Mr Böge' s report, but in the forthcoming debate on Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report we must look again at the position of those countries where TSEs do not occur. endTok	25.235372699742776
startTok Mr President, I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur. endTok	10.257460698864975
startTok There is no doubt that Mr Böge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field. endTok	23.23795656578924
startTok It is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of Parliament because it is extremely important. endTok	20.510744829806455
startTok Regardless of the many other concerns we may have, BSE has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved. endTok	67.21110825680239
startTok It is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem. endTok	31.75495640805731
startTok I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will, I hope, address this situation. endTok	104.80870198767596
startTok We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future. endTok	52.516643699911825
startTok No-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again. endTok	133.4861422684739
startTok We have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work. endTok	50.25263572578257
startTok It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it. endTok	54.436209210192814
startTok BSE has certainly not gone away. endTok	87.2624904365643
startTok You can see it in different countries. endTok	62.14831800530067
startTok I do not want to point the finger at any particular country, but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the United Kingdom. endTok	47.29429906046844
startTok It will be there for some time to come. endTok	27.67202386691493
startTok We have to ensure that the whole system of traceability, of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain, is part of that confidence-building mechanism. endTok	124.11126184989537
startTok If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future. endTok	22.67420061241397
startTok Finally, I have certainly believed for a long time, coming from an agricultural background myself, that if we had fed the animals the proper food and if the animal feedstuffs had been made up of the proper compounds we would never have had BSE in the first place. endTok	88.54580873959628
startTok It was never the responsibility of the farmer, it was the food compounders who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again. endTok	75.53437283283692
startTok . Mr President, I am pleased to have been given this opportunity to discuss a subject where there is good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, namely combating TSEs. endTok	38.528773834417706
startTok I should also like to thank Mr Böge for his work on this issue. endTok	7.316091984305596
startTok Considerable progress has been made on our proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation under Article 152 of the Treaty on the prevention and control of TSEs. endTok	33.78267191100474
startTok This proposal addresses all TSE risk in all animals at all stages of the production chain. endTok	94.12066210948025
startTok I am here today to listen to your opinions on the first step in this process of establishing a truly comprehensive Community system for the control of these diseases. endTok	36.6931848075819
startTok I have proposed in the proposal at hand to delete all currently existing Community rules on scrapie in sheep and goats and to transpose them to the framework proposal for a regulation. endTok	67.13647612727272
startTok The detailed rules would then follow in that framework proposal. endTok	172.06239784233276
startTok I have been informed that you welcome this initiative, as appears from your contributions this afternoon, to formulate a single text. endTok	73.51122713456677
startTok I am looking forward to discussing any further improvements you might wish to suggest under the framework proposal for the legislation, especially after the reference made by Mrs Roth-Behrendt to her own report and opinion on this issue. endTok	67.23175082361858
startTok I look forward to receipt of that document, which will be taken into account in all further considerations in relation to this issue. endTok	31.96994698198731
startTok Finally, I would say this in relation to the observation about including legislation in annexes and the observation that we must achieve an effective balance between Parliament having a full say and yet at the same time our having speedy resolutions, speedy legislation and speedy amendments to existing legislation. endTok	74.89682985815796
startTok In the months I have been Commissioner and observed the way legislation goes through the system, I can see that much work needs to be done on this issue so that we can all achieve what we seek to achieve, that is, the translation of policy into legislation. endTok	73.77628301188955
startTok Thank you, Commissioner. endTok	17.829155313593716
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. endTok	4.628394244073071
startTok Community policy in the field of water endTok	45.47282205490289
startTok The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0027/2000) on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (9085/3/1999 - C5-0209/1999 - 1997/0067(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann). endTok	18.022317676805404
startTok - (FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, water will be one of the main environmental and world issues of the twenty-first century. endTok	41.4611546394665
startTok Climate change, global resources, river quality and groundwater aquifer quality are major challenges which threaten our common future. endTok	227.1773936458548
startTok We will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet' s ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions, the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even, more fundamentally, the global balance. endTok	66.51070417728482
startTok To support this statement, I would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague, Mário Soares, in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans. endTok	36.36410469431403
startTok When talking about climate change, we have rightly referred to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere. endTok	61.383949939997294
startTok Yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet. endTok	43.660361039155454
startTok Europe must therefore lead by example to some extent, both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters, including its groundwater, surface waters and seas. endTok	106.99651345407341
startTok Furthermore, Europe has signed international conventions, in particular the OSPAR Convention in which it made certain commitments. endTok	113.48080040413927
startTok In this it said that in a few years' time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances. endTok	52.33280817464681
startTok Despite having signed these international agreements, this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that Europe cannot achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened. endTok	136.8428593917723
startTok This is why in the debate on the framework directive on water policy, the European Parliament has since the first reading demanded coherence between the framework directive and the international objectives, particularly with regard to respect for OSPAR. This convergence must be effective and specific and must commit us to action. endTok	58.4568179088928
startTok The European Union' s water policy is not starting from zero. endTok	43.38902163620407
startTok Many directives have already been adopted. Furthermore, the Commission wants to make these directives more understandable and more compatible with each other and to give them clearer objectives. endTok	63.783205662586674
startTok The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation. endTok	26.22509972887989
startTok However, at first reading this House insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made, like OSPAR, but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs. endTok	55.8241352066231
startTok For despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection, when we look at the state of the environment in Europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved. endTok	52.72246457138143
startTok In many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts. endTok	54.67344139238859
startTok We must set objectives which are equal to the challenges facing us. endTok	55.47934344326536
startTok Yet we do not have much time. endTok	26.320486628601948
startTok We could, as the Commission has proposed, accept these overlong deadlines which the Commission and the Council have extended even further. Yet if we do, we will not only have a credibility problem with the general public, but these efforts will be postponed until tomorrow and then tomorrow they will be deferred again. endTok	94.21697944983653
startTok It is clear that in this event the objectives will never be achieved. endTok	22.4231590034415
startTok I am stressing this point because, when disasters are being reported daily in the news, we cannot just keep on saying for the umpteenth time that Europe did not act when it should have done. Then, in our haste, we act as if we will solve the problems which we refused to tackle properly at the appropriate time. endTok	78.90342377940051
startTok The current example of the Danube and the pollution from Rumania shows very clearly that if we fail to establish a new method of economic development, clear requirements, controls and precise measures concerning the state of our rivers, this type of incident will not only occur again but will do so increasingly over time. endTok	87.5574200632954
startTok It is also clear that if we do nothing, our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner. endTok	26.547299836912366
startTok Even now, the rivers in Brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism. endTok	110.09341484438552
startTok To conclude, the issues are clear at this second reading. endTok	86.79310669931638
startTok Do we or do we not want standards compatible with OSPAR, in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero? endTok	126.2153191090003
startTok Do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive? endTok	26.8363099985794
startTok Do we want to have a pricing policy which enables all public and private participants to clean up and save water? endTok	58.712313738367335
startTok Do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples? endTok	49.574458991359464
startTok The majority of the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objectives. I hope they will be supported by this House. endTok	20.384320000119015
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us, especially as the very source of life for human beings. endTok	41.29457023324018
startTok The problem is one of both water quality and water resources, of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe, especially in very dry regions. endTok	68.56307442060137
startTok I am sorry that Commissioner Wallström, who is responsible in this area, cannot be here now because this is, after all, a very, very important directive on which the Commission has been working for a long time, and water protection legislation, which we are debating now at second reading, affects all the citizens of the European Union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join, who will have to comply with EU legislation once they accede. endTok	48.09242111194533
startTok We have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994. endTok	32.5877997895927
startTok A great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers. endTok	27.85138235265244
startTok We reduced the 243 proposed amendments in the Environment Committee to 77, but another 30 have been added. endTok	218.17142041439018
startTok You see, there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different. endTok	68.84914853381167
startTok Some want tighter legislation, some want more clarification, others want to serve national interests. endTok	497.20575049279586
startTok Even within my group, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, there were, of course, differences of opinion. endTok	21.160059954375132
startTok Our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions. endTok	106.15155933488441
startTok In this sense, the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position. endTok	30.10713744507596
startTok Some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the European Parliament' s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the Council of Ministers. endTok	53.14329494303955
startTok We obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the European Parliament' s credibility. endTok	59.733520250678616
startTok For me, that includes the zero demand, i.e. the demand for zero inputs up to 2020. endTok	105.99269031547443
startTok That would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings. endTok	139.7252110052745
startTok I should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and European water protection laws, however imperfect they are and however little they are complied with in the Member States. endTok	76.7586295485006
startTok I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine, which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe, which was particularly polluted. endTok	41.029314712205384
startTok That does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money. endTok	52.569232934416945
startTok Farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days. endTok	39.351439590116975
startTok You can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water. endTok	64.59968617243362
startTok The line followed by our group for the negotiations with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too. endTok	51.990004222728274
startTok I am horrified that both Members of Parliament and the public have been misled by false arguments in this difficult and sometimes highly technical matter. endTok	57.97709990359805
startTok I therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises. endTok	61.959211396300844
startTok I also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, for all her work and her cooperative attitude, even if we have agreed to differ on certain points. endTok	53.03850058386238
startTok And I also thank the representatives of the European Commission, who stood by with advice and expert help at all times. endTok	61.2674775791568
startTok If the representatives of the Council of Ministers take an equally constructive approach, then I have no doubt that together we shall find an even better solution to the problem of water protection in Europe under the conciliation procedure. endTok	52.96640782315353
startTok Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work which she has presented and on her efforts in terms of overcoming the differences between us with regard to water. endTok	26.471266612193894
startTok The framework directive on water is a necessary initiative. endTok	47.20587775488766
startTok Nevertheless, given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of European construction, this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion. endTok	31.991456523556938
startTok Nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us. endTok	84.33241347358022
startTok However, in Spain and the other southern countries, which have an unusual climate, the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures. endTok	56.37690954783657
startTok Therefore, we believe that this framework directive should advocate a use of water which allows us to overcome territorial imbalances and, to this end, I ask that you support Amendment No 95, which has been presented by our group. endTok	51.09431013645391
startTok We wish to ensure that Article 1 of the directive promotes the sustainable, efficient, fair and considerate use of water. endTok	48.91215108755439
startTok I am now going to briefly discuss the main issues on which the Spanish Socialist delegation differs somewhat from certain positions which have been expressed here. endTok	59.36667736395446
startTok One example is water transfers. endTok	301.11014831923
startTok We would prefer the future framework directive not to subject the implementation of transfers to Community supervision. endTok	96.26835204108653
startTok We consider that, given the hydrological characteristics of Spain, where transfers of a structural nature are carried out, the authorities of the country should make decisions with regard to its own resources, and these decisions should, of course, always be taken in accordance with the quest for cohesion and the rational use of water. endTok	51.74353790345032
startTok With regard to one of the most controversial points of our debate, the application of tariffs, the Spanish Socialists have been arguing, in accordance with the principle that the polluter should pay, that the directive should propose policies on accessible prices for all levels of consumption. endTok	43.073593418566276
startTok In Spain, a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of Europe. endTok	47.13706009952183
startTok The Spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different uses, owing to the scarcity of water resources and the internalisation of the environmental costs which will have to be met within the framework of the provisions of the directive. endTok	29.348885697626724
startTok We have therefore always argued for a progressive system of recuperation of costs. This system should take good account of social, environmental and economic effects, and its implementation should be modulated in accordance with differing geographical and climatic conditions. endTok	57.600605352578114
startTok We want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment. endTok	33.173240937309615
startTok However, an environmental Europe cannot, in any circumstances, be built at different speeds, but must be built from a point of view of solidarity. endTok	53.85651371436999
startTok Mr President, the ecological disaster in the Danube reminds us of how closely linked all the countries of Europe are and how important water is to us all. endTok	49.16242836417471
startTok Discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe. endTok	41.28345628067841
startTok This brings home the connections which bind us together. endTok	82.47345958733978
startTok This framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details. endTok	27.653985518918624
startTok It is important for us to remember that this is a framework. endTok	17.2566068507299
startTok These brushstrokes are indeed very broad. endTok	89.25483646570464
startTok It is easy for individual countries, for individual sectors of industry, to escape the effects which have been painted to us in recent days. endTok	48.70081163066468
startTok There are many opportunities to hide. endTok	71.53104762617232
startTok The reality is that the details of this legislation will be set out in daughter directives in months and years to come. endTok	46.3359090729883
startTok That is the time to debate some of these problems of detail. endTok	53.865836646871664
startTok The broad principles are surely ones we should be able to accept - the broad principles that we wish to reduce hazardous waste leaking into the groundwater, the broad principles that we should be aiming to ensure that chemicals, which we all need in society in all circumstances, should not be finding their way into our water system. endTok	76.90246110332164
startTok There is a chemical factory in the north-west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation. endTok	26.746392458689808
startTok I would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not broadcasting to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing. endTok	42.553342624442784
startTok This is something that they prefer to avoid doing. endTok	31.814664156129357
startTok The principle also concerns water charging. endTok	124.93202086820857
startTok The basic understanding which many of us now share is that we need to introduce environmental taxation to encourage conservation, to use the carrot-and-stick approach to make best use of our assets so that we do not add to the pollution or loss of a valuable resource like water. endTok	83.4241070295683
startTok I want to refer to the political position here. endTok	25.55274709276485
startTok The common position has weakened the stand taken by Parliament at first reading. endTok	39.643324796061144
startTok Some of the NGOs would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless. endTok	59.12254094095011
startTok It is a retrograde step. endTok	21.148484957885717
startTok This is an opportunity for us to improve the situation. endTok	18.32545544940026
startTok We need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation. endTok	36.49330678804337
startTok We have seen vote after vote lost. endTok	310.0094507184745
startTok Measure after measure has come out of the Environment Committee. endTok	207.0929141007961
startTok We have failed to achieve a qualified majority. endTok	25.352443317320546
startTok Our attempt to improve the environment of Europe has failed. endTok	61.420460668718206
startTok We need to get into that conciliation position. endTok	78.18463634547459
startTok We need, at the end of the day, to ensure that we end up with a sensible, balanced policy of real improvements at a reasonable cost. endTok	45.98277450400954
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as long as nearly thirty years ago, the European Commission made attempts to draw up a European water policy. endTok	22.902107200080433
startTok A hundred and twenty-nine chemical substances had to be regulated. endTok	94.58442633245042
startTok Eventually, standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances. endTok	246.97058427164063
startTok The unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle. endTok	46.5271454496467
startTok Some seven years ago, it still looked like the European water policy was going to be sacrificed on the altar of subsidiarity. endTok	54.04066374137399
startTok The conservative government leaders Messrs Major and Kohl decided in a cosy fireside chat at the Edinburgh Summit that it was totally unnecessary for the Spanish to receive drinking water supplies which were as good as those of the Germans or English. endTok	66.04713490398862
startTok This sentiment is partly reflected in the common position which came about under British Socialist Presidency. endTok	96.88326809633817
startTok That position is like holey cheese, or to keep it the sphere of water, as leaky as a sieve. endTok	71.98074543604996
startTok It explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the Committee on the Environment: nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading. endTok	40.83556856346849
startTok This is unusual, but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes. endTok	33.081929537265886
startTok The dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak. endTok	81.14660041791312
startTok The chemical industry and, unfortunately, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance. endTok	70.52331034362798
startTok This is very time-consuming, and, more importantly, there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances. endTok	30.415425392601403
startTok Only the background level of the ocean is acceptable. endTok	70.40278932362835
startTok This is what is meant by the term "close-to-zero" . endTok	47.844556687541136
startTok The Commission already has a list of 32 priority substances, many of which have a hormone-deregulating effect. endTok	68.03664929658898
startTok These are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause, even in extremely minimal quantities, changes in the gender of animals and even humans, as is more and more being ascertained by scientists. endTok	82.76688342623761
startTok This is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year 2020. endTok	29.91458594463019
startTok I would like to mention two substances from the Commission' s list: mercury and tributyl, abbreviated to TBT. endTok	26.39674757568959
startTok On the bottom of the Wadden Sea, the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value, to wit, ten and one thousand times, respectively. endTok	77.99759625984069
startTok The chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by harmless substitutes, and if this is impossible, to apply them in closed systems. endTok	85.68190262611402
startTok For the substance TBT, this means that it can no longer be used as an anti-fouling substance. endTok	35.278372249112685
startTok A sound alternative would be to clean the ship' s sides mechanically. endTok	94.28520204386255
startTok I would like to finish off by expressing the hope that the European Parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close-to-zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone-deregulating substances by the year 2020. endTok	32.39570697470356
startTok Mr President, the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the Water Directive. endTok	17.59398860587776
startTok The Council's common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas. endTok	21.432495809876595
startTok Therefore, our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete. endTok	70.45662367327023
startTok As members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals. endTok	28.399164614917716
startTok Firstly, we think that the time-frame for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the Council. endTok	36.16981343142161
startTok We therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive. endTok	40.345321230151356
startTok Secondly, I should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently. endTok	25.228881643045934
startTok There should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented. endTok	53.45327598177442
startTok The legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions, such as the OSPAR Convention must be respected. endTok	40.55914070353771
startTok Thirdly, we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy. endTok	64.96592710769823
startTok This means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used. endTok	51.75920778408115
startTok Nowadays, taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming. endTok	135.72130065691522
startTok The obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay, although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases. endTok	105.17376627865207
startTok Fourthly, we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined. endTok	68.72011703489196
startTok Fifthly, the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear. endTok	156.83404044291407
startTok Against that background, our group is able to vote in favour of most of the amendments tabled by Mrs Lienemann, the rapporteur, as adopted in committee. endTok	42.61498059822961
startTok We should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended. endTok	26.635157300338324
startTok We will therefore vote for the Greens' Amendments Nos 102, 103 and 104, which we consider to be improvements on the present position. endTok	33.25872189088567
startTok As regards pricing policy, there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report. endTok	58.53636972958121
startTok My own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43, tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens' Amendment No 105. endTok	51.06519167458093
startTok I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned. endTok	103.68385925048412
startTok However, some people in our political group think otherwise. endTok	128.91026656104916
startTok Consequently, Amendment No 107, on the same question, has been tabled by one section of our group only. endTok	60.50012294516868
startTok On the whole, I welcome the committee's proposals set out in Mrs Lienemann's report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-won compromise. endTok	45.90411549456468
startTok Mr President, every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet, yet the abundance of water is an illusion. endTok	31.67692757649424
startTok The recent disaster on the Danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders. endTok	50.99084509284048
startTok Water is a renewable but limited natural resource. endTok	75.81077209270164
startTok It becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable. endTok	43.76932749942852
startTok In the EU, this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas. endTok	25.88042448948402
startTok The increase in vulnerable areas, both wet and dry, inequalities between countries, inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic, economic, geographical and geological events are all the evidence we need. However, these must not lead to competition distortions within the Community. endTok	87.47370833977573
startTok We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water, given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land. endTok	46.39696372979016
startTok Agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive. endTok	52.14766415605144
startTok It is not only in the Member States that solutions to these problems are being sought. Last October in Turin, the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demanded a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean. endTok	47.80819349049782
startTok We are not, fortunately, at this point. endTok	33.93236368043012
startTok However, we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods, which the directive underlines. endTok	46.9132531449976
startTok For example, France, the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffered flooding. endTok	61.702295155207196
startTok We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other. endTok	32.635555242585745
startTok Yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water. endTok	46.56081359284994
startTok The water issue will definitely not be settled today. endTok	58.490806658953446
startTok In fact, the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects. endTok	64.67788201863415
startTok Mr President, it is very likely that, during this century, good-quality water will be of even more strategic importance than oil. endTok	91.0359342653172
startTok This is enough reason to thank Mrs Lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water. endTok	59.23951161072321
startTok It seems rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework. endTok	72.85924258611004
startTok With the framework directive on water policy, we are hoping to end the fragmentation of the EU' s water legislation. endTok	40.308054920447454
startTok But that has not dismissed us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies. endTok	52.48178444654773
startTok More specifically, the possibilities for adopting a specific policy by Member States and water boards, which have been set up thanks to the catchment basin approach, need to be maximised. endTok	58.686199081286176
startTok The key goals remain the prevention from further pollution of ground and surface water, the protection of eco systems, the promotion of the sustainable use of water, the control of floods and droughts and the termination of discharging dangerous substances into surface water. endTok	69.43315919095876
startTok As far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned, I am of the opinion that the Councils' objectives lack both commitment and ambition. endTok	66.91814995417697
startTok The Committee on the Environment' s present proposal to reduce discharges to close-to-zero is, in my view, to be welcomed and worthy of emulation. endTok	43.022891730339865
startTok However, a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability. endTok	35.593196923504685
startTok Consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced, as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control, and which pollute the water quite substantially. endTok	77.77984319933815
startTok Mr President, we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect. endTok	41.80019883526816
startTok In the 20th century, water was merely a free evacuation and disposal system for poisonous substances, special waste, chemicals and so on. And we can already see the consequences! endTok	109.31789663040706
startTok We need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation. endTok	59.74052751951697
startTok The directive must be negotiated accordingly and our citizens must be able to understand what we or rather what the Commission is planning here. endTok	55.35097567366473
startTok In the final analysis, water protection is not just a social question, it is a decisive social question, which is why the polluter pays principle must be applied more rigorously as otherwise we all bear the consequences. endTok	51.08752530609137
startTok Given the advanced state of pollution of water resources, it is important not just to maintain the status quo but to ensure during the vote tomorrow that we achieve genuine quality improvements. endTok	85.11027699642284
startTok Mr President, it must be some six years ago now that Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, assisted by Mrs Ursula Schleicher, put in a request and managed to overhaul the water policy in its entirety. endTok	38.80549828483372
startTok It is not an easy topic and, in my opinion, the efforts made by Mrs Lienemann are very laudable indeed. endTok	36.914570533013446
startTok The decision-making process concerning this framework directive on water has reached a crucial stage. endTok	44.12001936697486
startTok The topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result, we have been able to draft important, more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading. endTok	58.85785015612625
startTok In fact, the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal. endTok	26.722719369143487
startTok It is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge. endTok	39.304378920933196
startTok I would also address the Spanish Member in this respect: in the North of Europe, we often face floods, but also polluted water, from industry, whilst the problem facing the Members in the South is often related to transporting water over long distances, simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture. endTok	116.32197135915656
startTok I would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail. endTok	21.379546058510815
startTok I would first of all like to focus on quality. endTok	30.7874926966887
startTok The Netherlands is significantly affected by the European water policy. endTok	32.260353954592496
startTok A very important component, to wit, one third of our drinking water, is extracted from surface water in the Netherlands. endTok	49.852877296861095
startTok The Netherlands is located downstream, in a delta, which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance. endTok	44.83971080229922
startTok Another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality. endTok	57.14284360109353
startTok In a number of amendments, the proposed standards and especially the OSPAR standard for 2020 are called into question. endTok	112.42402287805506
startTok Although I understand that, according to some, this standard is unclear or that it cannot be defended judicially, I do believe that we have to support it because we could then provide more precise standards in a conciliation procedure. endTok	50.18784745827362
startTok I would now like to say a few words on quantity management. endTok	22.919160564757497
startTok In his poem "Herinneringen aan Holland" [ "Reminiscing about Holland" ], a famous Dutch poet mentioned water too, which, with its never-ending trail of destruction, was feared and respected. endTok	93.28072891445878
startTok In 1953, we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology. endTok	36.06854245670036
startTok When our rivers flooded in 1990, we established that installing artificial works upstream affects the water-storage capacity downstream and can cause a great deal of damage. endTok	80.2457792652964
startTok This means that in terms of quantity management too, we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it. endTok	34.513929662070844
startTok Mr President, I too would like to start by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work. endTok	7.245150688873853
startTok Water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right. endTok	59.2912555522422
startTok Everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self-evident, as many have experienced in Southern Europe and are experiencing now in the Danube countries too. endTok	102.3640186710002
startTok Water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples. endTok	46.41575063541738
startTok This is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination. endTok	32.011454075382105
startTok We need to recognise that water is a joint liability. endTok	37.321943861837894
startTok Cooperation within a catchment basin must be self-evident. endTok	122.36819511639587
startTok Too little operational capacity upstream or, in fact, excessive use, can cause problems downstream. endTok	204.38557386789023
startTok Coordination is the key word here. endTok	105.7169931705996
startTok The problem of water is becoming increasingly topical. endTok	53.62455220224146
startTok Changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation. endTok	50.9063620756975
startTok Some areas are becoming drier, whilst many are becoming wetter. endTok	64.93359394892327
startTok It is time for action. endTok	24.22953251091492
startTok In March, the Second World Water Forum will be held in The Hague. endTok	48.62089946938588
startTok This Forum stands for a worldwide vision. endTok	63.552657878947386
startTok This vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control. endTok	72.00903322255476
startTok The time for action is upon us. endTok	56.09673857191656
startTok The European Parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a starting point and remain realistic at the same time. endTok	34.28639246189769
startTok But we should not lower our standards too much either. endTok	101.37982156977155
startTok The common position is not ambitious enough. endTok	19.89596407810549
startTok This is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements, or the OSPAR objectives. endTok	38.0395382335546
startTok We need to aim for dangerous substances to be phased out by 2020. endTok	35.7862507603633
startTok This has been agreed for the marine environment and it is obvious that this agreement will also apply to other waters too. endTok	28.06215504636954
startTok The OSPAR objectives are now being drawn up. endTok	35.972014477880215
startTok A list has been compiled, containing 400 substances which produce clear risks for the environment. endTok	112.70329133714533
startTok It is both technically and economically possible to reduce the emission of these substances to virtually zero and we need to opt for this once again. endTok	48.653507456554905
startTok Needless to say, the directive also needs to be binding. endTok	35.52533064100046
startTok Countries downstream must be able to count on the fact that countries upstream meet the quality objectives. endTok	60.48503695276119
startTok Quality has a price, but pollution could well have a much higher price tag in future. endTok	134.88026703656686
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, my compliments to Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work on the Water Directive. endTok	25.67987857237304
startTok I should like to remind you that the very serious environmental problems facing us today in the shape of climate change, the depletion of primeval forests and overfishing, constantly affect our common and vital but, in some ways, unowned resources. endTok	38.42657784269577
startTok We should also recognise that, in Europe, our fresh water sources may be said to be on the borderline between being owned by everyone and by no-one. endTok	63.20698118086437
startTok It is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established. endTok	39.36947614605061
startTok It is also important for the different watercourses to be kept together and managed as the totality they in fact are, irrespective of who owns one section or another of a common watercourse. endTok	52.08006021404223
startTok Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive does indeed, as many speakers have already said, represent an historic chance to simplify and improve the jumble of piecemeal EU regulations and directives and achieve a high level of environmental protection in Europe. endTok	36.51452521777792
startTok However, I have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation. endTok	45.52597676943072
startTok I also hope that the vote will not be a washout and that will depend on what I see as two quite fundamental points. endTok	46.27072041989687
startTok First OSPAR. endTok	470.1289555057355
startTok We know that the Commission proposal does not go far enough; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment. endTok	24.15381938402975
startTok Merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough. endTok	103.746123297197
startTok What we need is a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR. endTok	71.25665943154877
startTok Only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and, more importantly, objectives which are enforceable under the law. endTok	73.88069855600124
startTok Anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disasters, such as those which have just come to light in Romania and Hungary, from happening to us. endTok	87.73022923378532
startTok I find it unfortunate that national governments are not prepared to stand up for legally binding protection, despite having agreed internationally on OSPAR. endTok	93.15662417313906
startTok But I think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in Parliament, in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised. endTok	22.91456004073489
startTok It is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth. endTok	60.28069468775058
startTok We must not bow down before the agricultural or chemical industry lobbyists; on the contrary, we must use our vote to promote and express that fact that we want the polluter pays principle and, hence, cost-covering prices. endTok	69.71099569217787
startTok Water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the OSPAR convention. endTok	41.589642272025124
startTok With closed production circuits this is possible; anything else would water down the directive. endTok	200.40879372575031
startTok Let us grab our chance. endTok	46.1254285435338
startTok Mr President, in the small amount of time allotted to me, I would like to welcome the Mrs Lienemann' s report and remind the House of three principles, to which all other principles must be subordinate, which are clearly expressed in the rapporteur' s amendments: water is not a commercial product, but the property of all the peoples of the Union; the ultimate objective is to eliminate all pollutants in surface water and groundwater, and to inform the public so that it can participate in the recuperation of water and not use water excessively given that it is such a precious commodity. endTok	52.7871643956404
startTok I know that this directive may have problems, given the differing situations of the various countries of the Union, as has already been mentioned. endTok	25.354244640377367
startTok The situation in the north is different from that in the south, and different from the situation in those countries which have the problem of desert areas. endTok	38.04517977676603
startTok I understand this. endTok	37.124871579737444
startTok However, there are some amendments which attempt to help the countries of the south, specifically Amendment No 43 which, with regard to the recuperation of costs, also indicates that Member States must take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when it comes to decision making. endTok	36.58255423218723
startTok There are also difficulties with the issue of transfers. endTok	42.05430236423797
startTok In my country - I live in the north of Spain -, there is a considerable difference between the north and the south, and difficulties arise when we have to transfer water from one place to another. endTok	61.4877417252437
startTok However, Mrs Lienemann' s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water. endTok	115.31178758220878
startTok I know that this is a difficult report and that the differing situations of countries cause difficulties, but we must move forward with a framework directive which will prevent a repetition of what is happening on the Danube and what happened in Doñana. endTok	47.978639952376675
startTok We cannot allow our European water to be polluted, Mr President, and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water, which is so precious to all of us. endTok	58.40541228812548
startTok Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report. endTok	23.467400147687094
startTok As an Irish Member of the European Parliament, coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water, I support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive. endTok	43.89059825011059
startTok However, I would now like to look at the areas of difference between Parliament's Committee on the Environment and the Council. endTok	22.385772867220858
startTok The latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter. endTok	33.35930870269947
startTok According to the Council the objective of achieving good surface water status should be secured no later than 16 years after the directive enters into force, whereas Parliament's Committee on the Environment would like to see this deadline shortened to ten years. endTok	72.0265126643159
startTok I see no reason why European Union Member States cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible. endTok	91.23727194158069
startTok I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage. endTok	48.88931141480306
startTok The Council in its common position states that the European Union governments must take account of the principle of recovery of the cost of water usage. endTok	36.69420837728525
startTok No specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position. endTok	38.215407916265505
startTok Amendment No 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in Europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently. endTok	83.35686664565613
startTok Moreover, an adequate contribution from different economic sectors, broken down into industrial, household and agricultural sectors, must ensure that this policy is implemented. endTok	65.76100608771677
startTok Unless these amendments are supported tomorrow a strong message will be sent out that metering and water rates should be implemented for households right across the European Union states. endTok	85.09400447143165
startTok This is politically impractical from an Irish perspective, as indeed it would be from the perspective of other EU Member States such as Portugal, Greece and Spain. endTok	65.60302996618692
startTok Mr President, I want first of all to say thank you to Mrs Lienemann for her report. endTok	27.13018055754815
startTok It is here and now that we decide to what extent the EU countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come. endTok	40.59005796971714
startTok We can do this by, as a Parliament, amending the Council' s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment. endTok	61.08827481999705
startTok In its unaltered form, the present directive could, in fact, have very unfortunate and long-term consequences for the environment and for our drinking water. endTok	45.810810990098666
startTok It would be to send out the wrong signals both to European industry and to the European people. endTok	53.7111003156216
startTok It is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters. endTok	101.10431072699997
startTok The directive quite obviously provides too extended a time frame within which time is to be spent measuring every single one of the approximately 100,000 chemicals in circulation. endTok	169.49347107526384
startTok We cannot afford to wait. endTok	28.82280615178706
startTok In this connection, I would ask Parliament to support Amendment No 108, in which the words "water pollution caused by individual pollutants" are replaced by "prevention of water pollution through the continuous reduction in discharges" . endTok	61.63998153605312
startTok We cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment. endTok	131.16396141618267
startTok The EU' s Ministers for the Environment must therefore stand by their affiliation to the OSPAR Convention, which now already defines what is hazardous to the environment. endTok	66.04615860563287
startTok This Convention should be our guide in working for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and, not least, to our descendants. endTok	72.76390350195584
startTok Mr President, it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive. endTok	46.04316625567532
startTok The Treaty of Amsterdam reiterates the priority criteria for prevention, for the implementation of the 'polluter pays' principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment. endTok	34.75372207708491
startTok Clearly, the importance of recognising the economic value of ecological factors in setting prices and making operators accountable through the adoption of incentives for non-polluting systems, seems unquestionable in the light of events that characterise the relationship between economic development and the protection of our environmental heritage, particularly our water resources. endTok	90.26367758689283
startTok This situation is loudly echoed in many sectors of the economy, and especially in the agricultural sector. endTok	20.12193574693137
startTok The concept of good agricultural practice has been introduced in amongst the complexity of the current relationships between agriculture, environment and water resources, and between positive and negative effects, and amongst the wide range of local realities and production systems and so on. This concept indicates which agricultural production method to use in order to satisfy the Community expectation of an environmental protection of water resources that surpasses basic standards, along with the subsequent costs and reductions in income. endTok	106.92867848175418
startTok The obligation to develop and consolidate a strategy for integration derives from this notion, with the aim of keeping the management of water resources at the heart of the sustainable economic production model in the light of current conditions. endTok	55.68697644681386
startTok We must not, with this in mind, pursue a strategy of separating the objective of preventing a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater from the objectives of protecting, improving and restoring their quality, as this would create a superfluous hierarchy of priorities detrimental to the overall functioning of interventions and specific measures that target a combined approach and the use of the best available techniques. endTok	80.82673247979554
startTok As regards eliminating the pollution generated by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment, an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and Community levels, which enables clearer identification of the various classes of bodies of water polluted as a result of human production activities. endTok	86.96876160431225
startTok Finally, we need to set up a system which prepares an objective list of potentially dangerous substances, using the increased information available on their chemical, physical and biological properties, in such a way as to create an integrated model for intervention at a range of strategic levels in order to protect our water heritage, which is fundamental to us all. endTok	60.46831118813503
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to take the principle of sustainability enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam seriously, then our long-term objective must be to achieve zero inputs in our water because we need to safeguard water so that future generations do not pay the price for our water consumption. endTok	41.95079576875743
startTok We can achieve this long-term objective by developing measures with demanding standards. endTok	109.03386225318582
startTok In this respect, I fully support the amendments proposed by Mrs Lienemann to develop a reasonable approach using quality standards so that we can eventually say that, when people use water, they are not consuming it but maintaining present stocks. endTok	100.78820891532544
startTok This directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting. endTok	44.47441176130636
startTok First there is wide information for and involvement by the public, a rarity in a European directive. endTok	106.76045000892417
startTok Secondly, there is compulsory cooperation. endTok	77.36290516873571
startTok I am glad a holistic approach to water is being taken here and that authorities in the individual national states and beyond the borders of the national states are at last obliged to work together and ensure that water is of a high quality. endTok	72.6193280827567
startTok Thirdly, I should like to address the question of the timetable. endTok	18.144368777554433
startTok I am firmly convinced that we need a strict, tight timetable in order to work towards our long-term objective. endTok	35.15368108089787
startTok Compare it with what happens in December. endTok	142.09356488972313
startTok We all know in December that Christmas Eve falls on 24th December and we start buying presents. endTok	83.75888678998271
startTok But what would we do if we knew in December that Christmas was in thirty years' time. endTok	60.509528354563
startTok We all know what we would do, which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy. endTok	37.87719993218806
startTok I emphatically support the rapporteur' s proposals and think that we need a tight timetable for all areas of the directive, from the list of measures to the question of employment measures. endTok	40.497289904022594
startTok Mr President, the purpose of the present objective ought to be to ensure that the Member States work together to protect groundwater, drinking water and surface water and that the level of protection corresponds to existing EU environmental legislation. endTok	54.062442592791655
startTok May I take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolutions concerning the Nitrates Directive have still not been implemented in all Member States, in spite of the fact that there is a common EU resolution. endTok	31.013104990876926
startTok The present proposal tightens up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives. endTok	47.02347629567313
startTok It is proposed that a target should be achieved for concentrations in the aquatic environment which is close to the background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for humanly produced synthetic substances. endTok	60.910641806905815
startTok This cannot be done, and it also, in any case, goes against nature. endTok	46.62834527362269
startTok Adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the EU if concentrations of, for example, phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment. endTok	52.63877705072328
startTok European agriculture would not, for example, be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread. endTok	79.1749715064461
startTok As a result, agricultural production would move to other countries outside the EU, with consequent high socio-economic and employment costs. endTok	87.7984435840779
startTok I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs. endTok	53.80558712627892
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is a precious raw material. endTok	15.809813360924107
startTok Millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal. endTok	79.47780424820584
startTok It should, therefore, not surprise us that water is the cause of wars. endTok	40.364544718615264
startTok The capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs. endTok	53.03399902533941
startTok General interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation. endTok	130.90647128060368
startTok Europe is therefore facing an arduous task; that of combining a Community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation. endTok	119.76129177627267
startTok I have to admit that in Flanders, where I come from, we still have a long way to go too. endTok	27.167800603211276
startTok We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter. endTok	33.628805463102296
startTok Anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way. endTok	98.53122628721894
startTok The common position is in this respect a farce, a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreements. endTok	45.50686646715116
startTok The period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years. endTok	109.86848687834954
startTok By then, my children will be older than I am now. endTok	108.73874326990598
startTok You have to admit: this is a joke. endTok	21.832350954386794
startTok Tomorrow, we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children. endTok	55.123905197422154
startTok Either we opt for the amendments of my group, of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment. endTok	32.63238078052047
startTok I would like to finish off with this observation. endTok	10.408720622839859
startTok In the past couple of months, we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium. endTok	20.033120570446385
startTok What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers. endTok	58.54907121126187
startTok In our own country, this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations. endTok	46.94566725727886
startTok They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament' s more drastic positioning. endTok	49.990610292070905
startTok I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware. endTok	67.87246207213086
startTok Ladies and gentlemen, fine words are no longer sufficient. endTok	33.97051377968339
startTok We need to change tack completely. endTok	42.85107457936014
startTok During the vote tomorrow, we can make it clear that Europe is drafting a responsible and future-orientated water policy. endTok	75.25058437906588
startTok This can only benefit our credibility. endTok	53.679415497481926
startTok The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m. endTok	25.109489920053946
startTok The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform endTok	267.59807164850656
startTok The next item is the Commission communication - The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform: the issues at stake. endTok	62.31235432652888
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today. I am basically here to speak to you, as indicated by your agenda, on a new initiative which the Commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform. endTok	46.712844728507356
startTok This reform must involve all the actors in European construction, with yourselves as MEPs at the forefront but also myself as a Commissioner, the Council ministers and national MPs. It must also involve the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this European construction. endTok	66.96175192950047
startTok This morning, in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi, many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions. endTok	39.22043987146056
startTok Yet it is not just a question of who does what, as one of you said very clearly and forcefully. endTok	46.04719519142121
startTok Ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do. endTok	110.17449948783693
startTok We must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future, particularly with the countries which will be joining us. endTok	35.30097989900358
startTok We too are concerned about this lack of democracy, and the Commission has therefore decided to launch the 'Dialogue on Europe' in order to play its part in this direct contact with the people. This initiative will be launched on the day after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference. endTok	49.68852973946657
startTok During the IGC I will have the honour of representing the Commission together with Mr Prodi and of working closely with your two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos. All the Commissioners have undertaken to use some of their time when they go to any country or region, and not just their own, which in my case happens three or four times a month, to engage in direct dialogue with the public, and not just with the élite or those in power whom we meet as a matter of course. endTok	77.29992354011917
startTok We also plan to establish direct contacts in universities, schools and factories, to meet the people, answer their questions and listen to them. In this way we will play our part, as will you, in making the necessary effort and meeting the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizens from what we do. endTok	79.99409045266819
startTok We hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and in conjunction with the European Parliament. endTok	19.185384580220507
startTok We will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work. endTok	43.99065698524972
startTok We also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments, local elected representatives, non-governmental organisations, socio-professional organisations and the media. endTok	70.78147411968031
startTok Opinion multipliers, political groups and parties, MEPs and national MPs, elected representatives, as I have just said, local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved. endTok	99.03079387217151
startTok Need I remind you that the European Parliament itself took the initiative on 1 February? I must again thank Mr Napolitano for organising an initial working meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments who are, of course, the representatives of the people in each Member State. endTok	35.22919368440002
startTok The Commission will propose that the Member States become involved in this exercise either as part of ad hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership. endTok	54.01918988377784
startTok We are setting up a media plan and close contacts with the European Union Presidency and the European Parliament. endTok	50.05313905841013
startTok I have indicated the conditions under which the Commissioners will play their part through public meetings and visits. endTok	97.22401842882584
startTok We want to encourage debate among the people. endTok	54.801596669484866
startTok Without presuming to lecture you - God forbid - or even advise you, may I just point out that, when it was my honour to be Minister for European Affairs in my own country, I saw the need to establish a direct dialogue with the people? Each week, when engaging in this dialogue in each region, I realised that there was a real need for the European Union to have a face. endTok	68.07822070940414
startTok I therefore took a European Commissioner, and not just the French ones, or ambassadors posted in Paris or MEPs to engage in this dialogue each week. This made me realise that people had many intelligent questions and that they needed to be respected, listened to and informed. endTok	150.08615380494157
startTok So this is what we are going to do. endTok	12.65818260218445
startTok We will have a budget of approximately EUR 4 million for 2000 which you will hopefully approve. endTok	65.01960345689494
startTok Financing from the 2001 budget must also be negotiated as we want this initiative not just to be an experiment but to last throughout both 2000 and 2001. It will therefore be ongoing throughout the negotiation of the Intergovernmental Conference and the ratification process. endTok	81.52186584630287
startTok We will launch this dialogue on 8 March in Brussels in the presence of 700 young Commission stagiaires. endTok	91.50338979399571
startTok Your President, Mrs Fontaine, has agreed to take part with Mr Prodi and several Commissioners in this initial dialogue. I can assure you that, whenever a Commissioner intends to engage in dialogue, the most immediately available MEPs will also be able to take part in order to give their point of view and explain the work and role of the European Parliament. endTok	56.20804448352916
startTok That is all I have to say for the moment. endTok	27.192691340144318
startTok I welcome any questions, suggestions or proposals from the Members present. endTok	208.56395310437588
startTok Colleagues, you know the rules. endTok	314.59722893639844
startTok You are expected to ask questions, not necessarily make lengthy statements. endTok	202.52763967939853
startTok You have one minute each in which to ask your question. endTok	102.96846528627775
startTok Mr President, I think I also speak for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that I chair, in expressing my appreciation of this Commission initiative. endTok	23.11392979540811
startTok Moreover, this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by Parliament itself in its resolution of 18 November. endTok	71.74779480562029
startTok I have also heard Commissioner Barnier' s clarification of relations and links with the European Parliament during the implementation of this programme. endTok	38.111735062285526
startTok If I may make a suggestion, Commissioner Barnier, would it be possible for the communication to say something more on this subject, in addition to the straightforward and slightly clinical phrase which indicates that it will be carried out in conjunction with the European Parliament? endTok	30.646530096516518
startTok It would be helpful to stress this convergence of intentions and efforts because I can see a particular problem with coordination, specifically between the Commission initiative - which certainly does not only address members of national parliaments, but also members of national parliaments - and our committee' s programme. Following the working meeting of 1 February, which Commissioner Barnier referred to and which benefited from the weighty contribution of the Commission, the committee intends to take stock of developments at the Intergovernmental Conference at all of its meetings. endTok	66.18553717966275
startTok We therefore hope to benefit from the capable and consistent participation of members of national parliaments at all of our meetings, and this will be a channel which will ably supplement the ones in the Commission' s initiative. endTok	57.03237881170656
startTok Thank you, Mr Napolitano. endTok	29.410526751765087
startTok I can confirm that our proposal is completely within the spirit of the resolution of 18 November. endTok	44.074316820725116
startTok I also want at this stage to say that I was able to propose this initiative to the Commission thanks to the cooperation and understanding of my colleague, Viviane Reding. This initiative was also established in conjunction with Günter Verheugen as it involves all the major challenges of enlargement, both its opportunities and risks, and of institutional reform. endTok	54.375593968229474
startTok These challenges must be explained to our citizens who are concerned about them and questioning them. endTok	34.08401891474841
startTok I understand your concern, Mr Napolitano, and an interinstitutional working group will be set up. Its first meeting should take place in March. endTok	65.25799329202621
startTok I will ensure that we go further than the rather dry terms of the Commission' s text and it will certainly be more a question of sharing the work than working in liaison with each other. I will also ensure that over the next two years we can coordinate the initiatives taken by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint. endTok	70.5116423461553
startTok You realise that making a success of this dialogue means work for everyone concerned. endTok	220.72326311242162
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, it is music to my ears to hear you use the word 'citizen' so often. endTok	59.099879058426744
startTok We are increasingly concerned in this House about public opinion. The fear of public opinion is a rather paternalistic concept but our House is what it is and we must do what we can with it. endTok	59.43924738781493
startTok In terms of the IGC issue, I have a specific question for you. I believe that the Court of Justice in Luxembourg is currently looking very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and OLAF. endTok	44.34815486967639
startTok As you know, there are problems which not only concern this House but also the European officials who are also European citizens. endTok	63.52329982554332
startTok Given the urgency surrounding this issue, has the Commission considered the possibility of completely changing the structure of the anti-fraud office by moving to a solution which would entail the fight against fraud, in the Member States and in the European institutions, coming under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice? endTok	53.36256297506466
startTok Mr Dupuis, first of all I attach a great deal of importance in my public life to the word 'citizen' . endTok	87.61405222637875
startTok It is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used. endTok	25.987559699991248
startTok We will conduct this dialogue with our citizens, including the most disadvantaged and those isolated from decision-making or information centres. endTok	75.78666428143923
startTok With regard to the IGC and this issue of the fight against fraud, and specifically fraud against the Community budget and interests, we have retained the idea in our proposals of creating a new and specific post of a European public prosecutor. We have done this in the spirit of this House' s work and perhaps by going down the same road. endTok	51.433574844493684
startTok This public prosecutor would have the authority, recognised by the EU Treaty and therefore by the Member States, to investigate thoroughly any case threatening the Community budget and interests. endTok	73.91279920353219
startTok We can clearly and almost clinically see that legal cooperation is now no longer enough to fight against this fraud whether it originates from inside or outside the Community. This is why we have proposed the creation of a European public prosecutor who could, having investigated a case from start to finish, then have this investigated and ruled on by the most appropriate national court. endTok	150.45897740465705
startTok In reply to your second point on the Court of Justice, we have not yet established our position on the Court of Justice because we were waiting for the Dur report which was published a few days ago. endTok	33.200214077035305
startTok The Commission, as I have promised, will complete its proposals on the IGC opinion about the legal system and the Court of Justice within the next few weeks. endTok	41.26874400206007
startTok Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the day before yesterday, there was a leading news item in the most popular Danish news programme, which I would ask you to comment on. endTok	113.02986466969767
startTok The story went that an official in the Commission had apparently told an Austrian businessman that, because he was Austrian, he would possibly be excluded from being able to participate in a scientific development project together with businesses in other countries, including Denmark. endTok	118.08680646096936
startTok I would ask you to confirm that, if an official has said that an Austrian company is in some way excluded from participating in joint development projects, then this official has got the wrong end of the stick, and that, if he has not said this, then there is no story. endTok	74.69182920155411
startTok Will you confirm what is the case? endTok	46.06213936371172
startTok Mr Haarder, to my knowledge no official has been authorised to say such a thing. endTok	118.57301222681214
startTok My personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the Austrian people, businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in Austria of a new government coalition. endTok	90.7749848964145
startTok Therefore, subject to verification which I or someone else will give immediately after this sitting, I can confirm what you have just said, that the Commission has never said or authorised anything of this sort. endTok	100.61395157536202
startTok Generally speaking, there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in Austria. I have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957. endTok	74.5413971233858
startTok This is an economic community, of course, but it is also, primarily, a community of values. endTok	42.96514001539354
startTok This is why we are drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights which will more widely and more clearly protect our citizens on an individual basis. This is why we have Article 13 of the EC Treaty on discrimination which we proposed, in our opinion of 26 January even before the Austrian crisis, should be applied after the IGC by qualified majority rather than by unanimity. endTok	62.05746544057245
startTok This is why I personally have an idea to supplement Article 7 of the EU Treaty with a new paragraph which would give the democratic warning or monitoring procedure a legal basis. Finally, this is why we have public debate. endTok	80.37805260310463
startTok The only way to eliminate misconceived ideas is to offer alternatives, which brings me back to the subject of our discussion. I firmly believe in the democratic force and value of debate, particularly to fight against demagoguery. endTok	99.17133042337767
startTok Commissioner Barnier, you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe. endTok	67.45495983963959
startTok With reference to the IGC, as you know, under the Helsinki decisions the Portuguese Presidency was given the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the IGC during the course of the IGC. endTok	50.62938682794833
startTok Clearly, Parliament has its own representatives present, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos. endTok	201.8152233486407
startTok But would you, Commissioner, also be in a position to give an undertaking that if and when the agenda is enlarged by the Council you would report this to Parliament so that we could discuss it amongst ourselves and indeed with you, with the intention of continuing that dialogue with the citizens on which you have laid such stress? endTok	104.9138556679506
startTok Mr Beazley, my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise. endTok	51.98603785149629
startTok Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and many other members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and even more MEPs in this House know that, on behalf of the Commission, I will be available to tell you how things are going as they happen throughout these negotiations, in a spirit of transparency. endTok	43.86333666546709
startTok I will perhaps say this differently from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that, in many cases, we will say this together. endTok	58.54767530926579
startTok It is very important that these negotiations is not secretive with the European Parliament or the national parliaments which, when all said and done, will have their opinions to give and their positions to take in the ratification process. endTok	53.08956183584544
startTok This is why I congratulate Mr Napolitano' s initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliaments of the Fifteen and the European Parliament. endTok	37.6282435507204
startTok Having said that, the duty of transparency and debate starts here with regard to the reform of the institutions. endTok	50.54116451555828
startTok I will therefore be available whenever you want in order to inform you of our positions and the progress being made in these negotiations throughout this year. endTok	49.83078639360671
startTok Mr President, firstly I would like to compliment the Commission on its approach. endTok	14.474884122626046
startTok I think it is extremely useful to open up the communication channels with the citizen at an early stage. This did not really happen for the Treaty of Amsterdam or the Treaty of Maastricht and this has only led to a great deal of mistrust. endTok	36.15233770749872
startTok I have two questions. Firstly, you mentioned that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizens and I am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the European Commission. endTok	56.669098441034905
startTok Do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well, that is to say via the television and Internet? endTok	56.87226134858786
startTok My second question is of a critical nature. endTok	35.98552483896662
startTok The European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency. endTok	41.122791665349716
startTok If I compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the Netherlands, then the European model is vastly overshadowed by the Dutch model, and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the Netherlands. endTok	63.88423032164554
startTok My question is really: how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC, because the present directive is not a good example of this. endTok	34.926297685647
startTok Mrs Maij-Weggen, given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the IGC, it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now. endTok	73.57129725592002
startTok The group of representatives is currently meeting in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible. endTok	30.61390113342131
startTok The documents will in the main be open working documents. endTok	249.60872702201422
startTok Although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the European Council will not be open to the media, I am committed, as I must be at this stage, to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate arenas on these negotiations and the Commission' s viewpoint. endTok	57.56485557733187
startTok I can confirm, and thank you for having asked me about this, that we will use all the most modern means, television in particular, to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across Europe. endTok	60.27635448865729
startTok We will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums. endTok	218.4297812905078
startTok The Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised. endTok	73.28820913485166
startTok These are the modern means to be used. endTok	37.1770864371258
startTok However, I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people. endTok	21.849826723962323
startTok Although this may be a rather Utopian ideal, I want a Commissioner, when he can, an MEP, a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of Europe. endTok	72.69669268096125
startTok I have evidence that this is possible. endTok	30.067153284752337
startTok The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions. endTok	86.53061941499077
startTok Although this may seem rather egotistical, I want the Commission, in the minds of the people, to have a face and for those people forming the Commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible. endTok	48.0095237467898
startTok Mr President, I welcome Mr Barnier' s commitment to go to the regions, both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say. endTok	45.01071179135464
startTok I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire, a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding. endTok	42.2514534287088
startTok He can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner. endTok	58.58372816502205
startTok I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign? endTok	39.00943646188621
startTok In some Member States it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be. endTok	34.80285922024381
startTok That is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organisations that exist. endTok	45.320731288683525
startTok The Commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign. endTok	34.98988277553122
startTok Mr Corbett, thank you for your comments. endTok	26.260838630205637
startTok I willingly accept your invitation. If I have understood you correctly, you want me, when I come to Yorkshire, to talk not only about the reform of the European institutions but also the Structural Funds. endTok	50.35628366997354
startTok I can perform this dual task. endTok	57.05734943111195
startTok I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments, as I have already done, not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ. endTok	52.483298496916426
startTok Ten days ago I was in Westminster, so you can see, Mr Corbett, that I am not afraid of the difficulties. endTok	51.051606304293976
startTok Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin. endTok	39.31185760590205
startTok I have already appeared before the French Senate. endTok	44.047476709051494
startTok Therefore, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will go directly to see the national parliaments too. endTok	95.27427472464578
startTok With regard to the dialogue with our citizens, it is not a question of propaganda or marketing, nor even of communication. endTok	70.47775893814327
startTok I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue. So, after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform, those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion. endTok	107.0100856117604
startTok I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States. I sincerely hope, with your support, that the governments of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate. endTok	60.74183740584011
startTok Mr President, I should like to join Mr Barnier' s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with. endTok	55.60267946471326
startTok It is not much fun, of course, having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself. endTok	76.71340358789648
startTok In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr Barnier said, during his presentation in Parliament, that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision-making but, when I look at page 63, I see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say, the Residence Directives - ,combating discrimination, the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No 1408 and, with a few exceptions, of arrangements in the socio-political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting. endTok	73.8485062087089
startTok Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States' election processes? endTok	58.90027257370671
startTok It is, of course, these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments. endTok	44.822267104119845
startTok Can such matters be controlled from Brussels? endTok	216.33233124989914
startTok Is this an element in the radical decentralisation which Mr Prodi talked about this morning? endTok	79.01505808648399
startTok I was very glad to learn last week that the Commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference, not merely to relations between the Union and Member States, but also the Union, the Member States, regions and cities. endTok	43.49439686250909
startTok I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of Europe, Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears. endTok	72.43092177819989
startTok Commissioner, I want to go back to one of your previous answers. In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and, in particular, the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for the violation of fundamental freedoms. endTok	50.09559292794505
startTok Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this type, form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki? endTok	59.74867521504145
startTok I do not think so. endTok	22.384486642791376
startTok Are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion, unpopular opinions or deviations from the dominant European thinking? endTok	147.83314117604175
startTok Yes, Mr Bonde, we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission. endTok	51.55245192807389
startTok I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated. endTok	21.41127977150436
startTok In terms of social protection, I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology. endTok	91.19034177370145
startTok In your country, Mr Bonde, like everywhere else, I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people. endTok	59.849901746744976
startTok This will therefore be our rule. endTok	62.435219063811694
startTok We are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market. Our proposal is not general or systematic. endTok	72.30845094365917
startTok I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues. endTok	33.55698725752395
startTok I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical. endTok	25.190649009811516
startTok This has never been the case. We are simply trying to ensure, in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States, the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27. endTok	54.53862874982432
startTok Mr MacCormick, I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals. endTok	87.38249288815788
startTok It must get as close as possible to the people, where they live and where they have their roots. endTok	45.587583657723215
startTok If I said anything different I would be contradicting myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions. You will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people, where they live, to preserve their roots, traditions, soul and identity. endTok	86.58225234292047
startTok We will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions. endTok	39.64701113245806
startTok Mr Berthu, the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this. endTok	45.981941312328416
startTok It specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in Amsterdam. endTok	81.65955231390787
startTok It also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the Portuguese and French presidencies. endTok	44.06035372027162
startTok The Commission is acting correctly if, on a particular point, it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions. I am not yet sure that we will do this on Article 7. endTok	75.80791634443324
startTok However, if we do, this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which is sufficiently serious that the fourteen governments of the Union must mobilise together to give their response. We will also do this with regard for the future in general. endTok	54.68788626218541
startTok We will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957, and even before that, on the rubble of the Second World War. endTok	48.1639311260964
startTok Everything which can be done will be useful. I am sure that you and I, Mr Berthu, can at least agree on this. endTok	72.6830361570198
startTok Thank you, Commissioner. endTok	17.829151062792345
startTok You have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for Europe that you referred to. endTok	162.6249901926085
startTok You have set a very good example of time-keeping today. endTok	58.11618578804788
startTok That concludes the debate. endTok	29.09378695997705
startTok Question Time (Commission) endTok	519.4048513732919
startTok The next item is Question Time (B5-0009/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission. endTok	25.398756164958275
startTok First part endTok	205.55499927257594
startTok Question No 36 by (H-0025/00): endTok	7.084822951128554
startTok Subject: High infant mortality in Kosovo According to the latest UN data received from the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe; almost 50% of babies born prematurely die, while the war has produced a steep rise in miscarriages and children who manage to go to term are smaller than the norm. endTok	73.4864489220224
startTok In the context of the humanitarian aid provided by the Union and the efforts of its envoy Bernard Kouchner, will the Commission say what measures have been taken to safeguard the women of Kosovo's right to motherhood and the health of pregnant women, women in childbirth and babies? endTok	42.96223090659592
startTok Mr President, the Commission is conscious of the very difficult situation concerning health and health facilities in Kosovo, not just for pregnant women but across the board. endTok	48.29798821061474
startTok This results both from the recent conflict and from the years of neglect and lack of maintenance that preceded it. endTok	75.68190071709292
startTok The statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable. endTok	135.98955834676198
startTok However, the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population. endTok	33.941838517048666
startTok The Commission' s response has been as follows: firstly, the health sector has been a significant beneficiary of ECHO funding. endTok	76.80596970804763
startTok ECHO is currently focusing on the provision of medical supplies and emergency health care, on support to institutions as well as vaccination. endTok	83.39558984972217
startTok However, efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a self-sufficient healthcare system in the province. endTok	49.19908260633992
startTok UNMIK has already taken a significant role in this field. endTok	41.43169759699709
startTok Secondly, under the reconstruction programme, urgent intervention at the hospital in Mitrovica has already been initiated with a EUR 1 million rehabilitation programme. endTok	67.02902997204826
startTok Progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city. endTok	73.92245679155754
startTok However, the Commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of UNMIK for this project. endTok	48.47921868007101
startTok We hope that one day it may become a symbol promoting the benefits of ethnic reconciliation. endTok	85.07883040677734
startTok Under the European Community' s damage assessment, estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to dispensaries and health houses amount to EUR 4 million. endTok	99.94323120912432
startTok The Commission is now turning to the programming of 2000 funds. endTok	53.25724735403871
startTok We expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system. endTok	44.833884792843236
startTok The emphasis will be on long-term reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement. endTok	56.1554566080346
startTok Work is already under way with UNMIK to determine an appropriate contribution from the Commission to this enterprise. endTok	97.10439050283863
startTok Commissioner, this morning President Prodi, among others, stressed that the Balkans are testing our ability to act effectively, the very credibility of the European Union is on trial, and the gap between words and deeds must finally be closed. endTok	55.879983213064364
startTok Commissioner, do you really think that the facts we have about high infant mortality in Kosovo - the highest in Europe - and more generally the picture of human misery and destruction that prevails in Kosovo, are not already damaging our credibility and casting doubt on our ability to live up to our promises? endTok	61.60947994665777
startTok Besides, Commissioner, is so-called humanitarian military intervention justified by the present picture of human destruction in Kosovo? endTok	135.60330824257545
startTok Do you think that so much inaction is excusable when, on the continent of Europe itself, the right to life is at risk? endTok	47.67518899169686
startTok I do not think that our reconstruction agency or the task force before it, which have been working incredibly hard in Kosovo, would regard it as an adequate description of their labours to suggest that they had been standing idly by. endTok	80.59827545632808
startTok I am sure the honourable Member did not mean that. endTok	18.257319161520698
startTok Of course, she is entirely correct in saying that the Union' s credibility is on the line with what happens, not just in Kosovo but in the Balkans as a whole. endTok	38.58421430217135
startTok I am very concerned that the assistance we provide should arrive expeditiously and in a way which can maximise our assistance. endTok	52.353936192049275
startTok I would just make two points about the situation in Kosovo which we are addressing as enthusiastically as we can along WHO lines. endTok	42.746789132441215
startTok First of all, I am sure that the honourable Member recognises that over the period of the 1990s the government in Belgrade underfunded the health service in Kosovo, and many Albanians found that they were not really receiving any health care at all. endTok	48.86206699989944
startTok As a result of that, a parallel health care system was put in place through the Mother Teresa Society. endTok	66.15887458524223
startTok So what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic under-investment. endTok	46.91637386132206
startTok Secondly, and I am sure that the honourable Member recognises this as well, some of the tragic stories to come out of Kosovo in recent weeks have not been about child mortalities during carriage of a baby, but child mortality after a healthy baby has been born. endTok	64.15065996275304
startTok Those were cases in which women who during the hostilities, or before the hostilities, tragically killed their own children. endTok	94.84040665715403
startTok We are dealing with a horrific story in Kosovo. endTok	18.32315743161827
startTok We have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour, but it is not going to be easy. endTok	67.67342392139105
startTok Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your response to the Member' s first question and the supplementary question. endTok	21.74562222636749
startTok However, I still have some contacts in Kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by ECHO, among others, are often of inferior quality. endTok	114.28743129436366
startTok In some cases, there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like. endTok	78.33629460971535
startTok Are you aware of this? endTok	46.8379156762555
startTok Are you prepared to act upon it? endTok	58.75569589155516
startTok This is my first additional question. endTok	38.55345526669942
startTok My second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica. endTok	28.03234446810748
startTok You are perhaps aware that this hospital is located in the Northern part of the city and that, given the tense situation, Albanian Kosovars do not have any access to this section at all. endTok	42.90886734763899
startTok What does the Commission intend to do in order to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can get to hospital? endTok	30.097836063363268
startTok On the first question, I am going myself to Kosovo at the beginning of next month for another visit and I will certainly look into the allegation made by the honourable Member about the ECHO food package. endTok	49.66469995813475
startTok I have not heard that suggestion before, but it is an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I am there. endTok	38.09389326406367
startTok Secondly, I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica. endTok	53.74586629791729
startTok I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago, I saw the situation there for myself. endTok	61.19375507952187
startTok I had discussions with municipal leaders from both communities, including the leader of the Albanian side who had himself in the past been a doctor and was generally recognised for the medical work he had done during the hostilities and subsequently. endTok	98.70672425712661
startTok So I know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and I can assure the honourable Member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in Kosovo, whatever ethnic group they come from. endTok	58.16420272278921
startTok The particular difficulties in Mitrovica - for example, it is not just a question of Albanian patients having difficulty getting to hospital, Albanian staff have had difficulty working there - are particularly acute problems. endTok	95.08052997446747
startTok We will try to address them, but it is not easy. endTok	20.48483855803746
startTok Question No 37 by (H-0029/00): endTok	7.442231057300422
startTok Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Commission taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia? endTok	60.80649039564501
startTok The Commission supports any effort aimed at the settlement of the disputes between Turkey and Armenia and regrets that there has not yet been any normalisation of relations between these two countries. endTok	44.84188105070547
startTok In the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey, as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be opened without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. endTok	79.29769010338651
startTok Mr President, the Commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of Turkey to the European Union. endTok	32.0656192501915
startTok Will it make it a condition that negotiations can only start if the blockade is lifted because, in the final analysis, we are all neighbours and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relations inside the European Union? endTok	56.84785965826323
startTok My question therefore is this: will the Commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions? endTok	89.47458858203038
startTok The key issue is to support the efforts of the OSCE Minsk group to find a settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and we stand ready to help in any way we can. endTok	51.40358897609021
startTok We have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the TACIS programme to Armenia. endTok	82.29899579051481
startTok Let me relate my answer specifically to the question of Turkish accession to the European Union. endTok	61.34968416388724
startTok The situation of Turkey's relations with its neighbours will, as the honourable Member asks, be closely examined in the framework of the pre-accession strategy. endTok	40.68219468556247
startTok As stated in Agenda 2000 - and I quote: "Enlargement should not mean importing border conflicts". endTok	118.57046795329079
startTok That statement could not be much clearer. endTok	123.24211192198615
startTok But I repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results. endTok	52.29520319409541
startTok Question No 38 by (H-0040/00): endTok	7.5689513235820955
startTok Subject: Implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey Given that Turkey has recently been granted applicant country status, what is the Commission's view of the implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam, given the massive displacement of the Kurdish and the other people of the region that will result? endTok	43.05266916990644
startTok The Commission has no information regarding the impact of the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the population of the region. endTok	23.085440049563076
startTok We will, however, consider raising the matter with the Turkish authorities, together with other issues concerning regional development policies in the framework of the new pre-accession strategy for Turkey. endTok	57.1226292866332
startTok I have a related point. endTok	63.11358785191231
startTok It concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole. endTok	43.23556035083114
startTok As you know, the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to Syria and to Iraq in particular. endTok	62.803172425727986
startTok Given the extreme volatility of this region and given the very real concerns of many commentators that we will see an increased incidence of conflict, of so-called "water wars", in the coming decades, what is the Commission's view about the potential destabilisation, both in Turkey and in the wider region, that will be caused by this dam? endTok	67.18883806326431
startTok Can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well? endTok	48.72198340941059
startTok We will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member. endTok	26.018551554585756
startTok We have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up. endTok	80.73451751624292
startTok There have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area. endTok	70.10297208197117
startTok We will raise that, too, in the representations we make. endTok	95.86062350160539
startTok A number of other hydro-electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in Turkey have raised matters of concern, such as the effect on displaced farmers. endTok	72.99277405818071
startTok On the whole those seem to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily and I hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - is not a project in which the Commission is participating in any form. endTok	52.432320309760506
startTok Question No 39 by (H-0036/00): endTok	7.405277887989909
startTok Subject: Drafting of Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century. endTok	30.78653847114244
startTok What are the Commission's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)? endTok	65.64878014037656
startTok Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?) endTok	60.3954639203939
startTok Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda? endTok	68.6320595282886
startTok What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes? endTok	79.59989148891123
startTok What are the Commission's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union? endTok	31.018976462344753
startTok Like the honourable Member, the Commission welcomes the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government to start the process of drawing up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights. In the conclusions of the Cologne European Council the Heads of State and Government even established the broad outlines of the Charter' s content. endTok	40.4305784683425
startTok According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights. The first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. endTok	89.58656838928972
startTok The second is the rights reserved for citizens of the European Union. The third is economic and social rights, as contained in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, insofar as they do not merely establish objectives for action by the Union. endTok	49.6522211256191
startTok The Commission considers that the Convention responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights must respect the mandate given by the Cologne European Council. endTok	44.91063495541053
startTok Having said that, this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources. endTok	48.12124412209197
startTok As I have said before in this House, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, if necessary, to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances, particularly technological and social changes. endTok	59.884272155141275
startTok However, given the mandate and the final objective of the text to be submitted to the Heads of State and Government, this power must be exercised with caution and on a case-by-case basis. endTok	56.12319958112725
startTok The rights conferred by this Charter will have at least two types of beneficiary. endTok	73.78891345198191
startTok Some rights will apply to anyone present in the EU territory while others will benefit only citizens of the European Union. endTok	107.21903829329511
startTok It may also be envisaged that some economic and social rights could be guaranteed only for citizens of the European Union and third-country nationals meeting certain conditions. endTok	53.356278367706395
startTok It is not possible at this initial stage of the process of drawing up the Charter to prejudge its content in more detail. endTok	37.37841921655493
startTok However, I can confirm that the principle of equal opportunity and equal treatment between men and women will certainly be included among the rights guaranteed by the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is because this principle already figures among the rights guaranteed by the EC Treaty and by secondary legislation and because it undoubtedly constitutes a common constitutional tradition in the Member States. endTok	64.5829312248976
startTok As I have also said before to this House, the Commission is favourable to inserting the Charter in the EU Treaty. endTok	35.859548264874284
startTok However, we are fully aware that the final decision on this matter will fall to the Heads of State and Government. endTok	27.736212943868523
startTok The difficult part, which will fall to the Convention, is therefore to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text which can be integrated as such into the Treaties. endTok	94.92985553367001
startTok In its opinion on the holding of an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties, the Commission noted that the European Council must decide during the year 2000 on the inclusion of certain items on the IGC agenda, in particular the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. endTok	39.53066018938854
startTok Commissioner, it is quite significant that at the beginning of this new century people in Europe, men and women, are being called upon to redefine their rights and obligations. endTok	38.97193598121215
startTok We hope that this important Cologne Council decision will become a reality. endTok	28.621997559638842
startTok Globalisation on the one hand and enlargement on the other, make it urgently necessary to define those rights. endTok	114.89838379770217
startTok Seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the European Council in Nice will not be a wasted meeting. endTok	39.74714571188044
startTok But if we are to secure the public' s participation in this new planning, we would like to learn what plan the European bodies and specifically the Commission are proposing as the social and democratic model of Europe in the twenty-first century. endTok	58.05707855006377
startTok I listened to your general guidelines and I would like to ask you what is the position of children, as entities in their own right, in the Commission' s plans for the new model of society in the twenty-first century. endTok	35.439397509280944
startTok Mr President, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, in my opinion, and as Mr Prodi said this morning, the drawing up of the Charter is an exercise with great political significance. This is because it shows that the Union places the fundamental rights of citizens at the top of the political concerns for the future of our common project. endTok	44.12065051342881
startTok In this context, the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated. endTok	60.00592583296547
startTok The essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the European institutions, as contained in the European project enshrined in the Treaties of the European Union. endTok	29.324880719076432
startTok I understand your concern about the rights of children. endTok	31.250405034072013
startTok Many elements of our work, and particularly of my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, involve protecting the rights of children. endTok	88.33983675898793
startTok This is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully. endTok	37.65240196779974
startTok Each Member State is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children. endTok	76.75584789502854
startTok As for the EU' s responsibility, the rights of children must be recognised in the Charter according to the areas in which the Union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship, in its broadest sense, of children. endTok	40.15382849348724
startTok I hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable Member has posed for the Commission and the whole Convention. endTok	36.21464055773395
startTok Mr President, I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach. endTok	29.17433389924294
startTok However, I should like to ask a slightly different question. endTok	33.07584106600086
startTok We have just heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is anxious to communicate better with the people and to aim the information policy of the Commission towards the major issues that the Community is dealing with this year. endTok	47.99712893655688
startTok Would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a Citizens Charter? endTok	62.35988328443995
startTok It is very important that the people feel engaged in this process. endTok	19.90073667932491
startTok I know that the Convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the Commission has. endTok	33.94985090387311
startTok Will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate? endTok	61.95203250983112
startTok It is the policy of the Commission to promote an open and wide debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non-governmental organisations but also with the citizens in a project as far-reaching as the Charter is. endTok	40.504618944627225
startTok I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights. endTok	22.79548196624135
startTok We can achieve the best of both worlds by having a clear text, a text that can be easily read by the citizens, and at the same time a text that can be used as a legal instrument. endTok	50.35468691410099
startTok There is no contradiction between the two. endTok	23.20043432789483
startTok The challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the Charter. endTok	54.432095148304924
startTok I am very glad to know that I can count on your support here. endTok	17.989661120721
startTok Question No 40 by (H-0095/00): endTok	11.517962090263751
startTok Subject: Articles 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on European Union Article 6.1 of the Treaty states that the Union is based on principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. endTok	40.132418465722154
startTok It is clear from statements over the past years that Jörg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in Austria. endTok	71.3143771379596
startTok Therefore, will the Commission state when they intend to propose under Article 7.1 that there is 'the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6.1.' , and urge the Council acting by qualified majority to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of this Treaty to Austria including the voting rights of the representative of Austria in the Council? endTok	81.50530777713936
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my answer by reminding you of the position adopted by the Commission with regard to the formation of the new Austrian Government. This was reiterated this morning in President Romano Prodi' s speech on that government which includes Ministers from Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party. endTok	32.22111289723928
startTok I am referring ,of course, to the statement made by the Commission on 1 February 2000, the basic elements of which I would like to restate. endTok	21.586373388119288
startTok The Commission confirmed then, as it does today, that it shares the concerns underlying the Portuguese Presidency' s statement of 1 February 2000. endTok	52.84515217727888
startTok These concerns are legitimate and there are good reasons for them. endTok	78.55886444971622
startTok There is no need for me to remind you of Jörg Haider' s political bias and of his many xenophobic and racist public statements, which are also anti-European. endTok	66.04644204560428
startTok The fact that an openly extremist, racist and xenophobic party can reach power in a Member State of the European Union will inevitably be a source of concern to the other States that are taking part in the European project. The European Commission is certainly not indifferent to the matter either. endTok	36.00944417949031
startTok Secondly, the Commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the Treaties, specifically with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union. endTok	49.70009343344047
startTok One of the most important innovations provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam was to clarify the basic principles which represent the shared heritage of the Member States. Another innovation was the establishment of a mechanism which would monitor whether these principles are being fulfilled, and which would react if any of them were violated. endTok	58.590991688868435
startTok The Commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars: that of the rule of law. endTok	67.42666054988827
startTok This principle means that the Commission must act within the limits laid down by the Treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 February was made. endTok	34.46718083876666
startTok The Commission is not a State. It cannot and must not act as if it were one. endTok	53.17409281141257
startTok In order to give a precise answer to your question, Mr Ford, I must remind you that in order for the mechanism established by Article 7.1 of the Treaty on European Union to be applied, there must be proof of the existence and I quote, of a "serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6." endTok	31.17603160851355
startTok I repeat, a "serious and persistent breach" is the condition necessary for the Commission to be able to propose to the Council that measures be adopted against a Member State. endTok	51.170759546477335
startTok I think that it is obvious that conditions have not been met which would apply to the current situation in Austria. endTok	21.448633853274888
startTok As a matter of fact I think that I am right in saying that we all hope that these conditions of a serious and persistent breach of human rights and of democracy are never fulfilled, either in Austria or in any other Member State. endTok	48.02175001839852
startTok I would like to assure you of my personal commitment and of that of the Commission, as stated once again by President Prodi this morning, to doing everything to ensure that we do not have to apply the mechanism stated in Article 7. endTok	33.152414863229495
startTok I would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary. endTok	28.808248289295072
startTok The values at stake are too central, too fundamental for us to accept dithering or compromises. endTok	165.09131057578935
startTok Individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say. endTok	109.7654852858147
startTok In Austria' s case, the statements are contradictory to say the least. endTok	124.51208869502463
startTok On the one hand, any of us could pick up on a whole cluster of inflammatory remarks by the leader of the Freedom Party. endTok	33.99067057109701
startTok On the other hand, the new Austrian Government' s programme reaffirms its commitment to defend democracy and human rights. endTok	27.982903989796277
startTok We will soon have our first opportunity, and an excellent opportunity it will be, to see which one of these two faces of the Freedom Party is the real one. endTok	51.02108892739266
startTok I am referring to the position the Austrian Government will adopt at the Council with regard to the Commission' s proposals for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directives. endTok	31.09451718969986
startTok One applies to the principle of treating people equally, without differentiating on the grounds of race or ethnic origin. The other proposal will provide protection at work against discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or racial origin, religion, handicap or sexual persuasion. endTok	78.49000609933614
startTok These are significant texts, adopted in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty, which gave the Community jurisdiction to fight discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnic origin, sex etc. endTok	39.584559884399745
startTok Lastly, I would like to assure you, Mr Ford, that the Commission will remain vigilant and will not fail to act in accordance with its responsibilities, should it prove necessary. endTok	25.132015503468594
startTok I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question. endTok	12.398683335441532
startTok But is Commissioner Vitorino aware, not only of Mr Haider's and the Freedom Party's words, but also of their deeds? endTok	108.46293695564796
startTok Mr Haider has actually been in government in the southern province of Carinthia where he has led a racist and xenophobic campaign against the Slovene-speaking minority in that region who are Austrian citizens, where he has attempted to abolish dual language education and where there has been clear discrimination against the Roma and immigrant communities. endTok	85.59806565416417
startTok Could the Commissioner answer two questions. endTok	130.7276323461171
startTok Firstly he talked about verification. endTok	54.767479636234384
startTok Can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it? endTok	72.03963361781084
startTok Secondly, does he not agree that were the current government, at a national level, to pursue the kind of policies that Mr Haider and the Freedom Party have pursued at regional level, then there clearly would be a breach of Article 6(1) of the Treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the Commission to take the necessary action? endTok	61.07234324763029
startTok We are not talking about words here. endTok	25.899911693274124
startTok We are talking about deeds by the Freedom Party and Mr Haider. endTok	47.370099554376175
startTok It is quite clear to me that it is the responsibility of the Commission to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the Member States according to the procedures and standards that are enshrined in Article 6 and justify the use of Article 7 of the Treaty. endTok	26.08471936773769
startTok Therefore I am fully confident that the Commission will be able to follow very closely the evolution of the situation in Austria, as in any other Member State. endTok	28.01146652253605
startTok If any concrete case of persistent violation of human rights perpetrated by the government of one Member State occurs, we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly. endTok	76.31746488650072
startTok I also rely not only on the cooperation of the Members of the European Parliament, but also on the cooperation of non-governmental organisations, which have always made an important contribution to the anti-discrimination policy of the Commission. endTok	24.306804238195756
startTok Regarding the situation in Carinthia, we need to look at this in detail. endTok	29.794869778357466
startTok The honourable Member raised the question. endTok	44.51295105995006
startTok The protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the Commission has put before the Council. endTok	77.11404389358206
startTok We should not only focus this debate on the Austrian question. endTok	47.363515661365334
startTok That question calls for reflection, for debate and, if necessary, for action. endTok	69.10276534591718
startTok I sincerely hope that all Member States will take the opportunity of this action plan and these two directives that the Commission has presented to the Council to reiterate in clear and concrete terms their approval for the action plan and for the directives and their commitment to fight against discrimination, racism and xenophobia wherever it might occur. endTok	48.47260775670495
startTok Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino, for your valuable contribution to this Question Time. endTok	24.41474688447234
startTok Second part endTok	406.7216805184345
startTok Questions to Mrs Wallström endTok	191.42500202250278
startTok Question No 41 by (H-0021/00): endTok	7.2654793074186
startTok Subject: Surplus electrical and electronic equipment Each year the European Union has to deal with a growing volume of surplus electrical and electronic equipment (6 million tonnes' worth in 1998), mainly on account of the speed with which such equipment becomes obsolescent. endTok	84.2371629019738
startTok The environmental problems stemming from the incineration and the dumping of such waste are mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substances (lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chrome, PVC and halogenated flame retarders). endTok	49.963180994889925
startTok A preliminary draft directive intended to regulate the management of such waste has been through three successive versions, the most recent of which dates from July 1999. endTok	76.77839683141262
startTok Can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft, which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998? endTok	74.57798098497405
startTok Is it true that the US Government is disputing most of the provisions of the current draft and is even threatening to appeal to the World Trade Organisation (for infringement of Article XI of the GATT and Article 2(2) of the Agreement on technical obstacles to trade) if it is adopted? endTok	60.69125842869517
startTok The Commission agrees with MEPs that the current method of dumping electrical and electronic waste is causing major environmental problems. endTok	70.89398882244033
startTok Consequently, the Commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and, since 1997, has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned. endTok	40.35163183628573
startTok The outcome of the discussions, as well as of the in-depth investigations which are being carried out in this area, are now being examined by the Commission. endTok	31.57806307988294
startTok Some parts of the proposal have been criticised, among them the phasing out of some heavy metals and brominated flame retardants, as well as the application of the principle of making manufacturers responsible for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste. endTok	40.499443094570346
startTok The United States' delegation to the European Union is concerned about certain points in the last consultation paper, inter alia the phasing out of the materials already mentioned, as well as certain questions arising from the principle of manufacturers' responsibility for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste. endTok	46.79187432438612
startTok The main argument put forward by the United States in this context is that the present provisions are, they say, incompatible with international trade law. endTok	41.562858561368756
startTok The Commission is currently carefully reviewing the United States' arguments. endTok	61.17525810034126
startTok I should just like to add that my intention is that the Commission should be able to present a proposal on the dumping of electrical and electronic waste before Easter. endTok	23.749512593807243
startTok My question specifically concerned the reaction of the US Government to the text of the preliminary draft. endTok	99.31604436985586
startTok There have in fact been three preliminary draft texts with the last one, to my knowledge, dating from July 1999. endTok	105.93700848537709
startTok Is this the text which you will be submitting, or an amendment to the original version? endTok	67.04104873593833
startTok Version 3 is already much weaker than Version 2 following the comments of US industry as relayed by the US Government. endTok	341.4897816676177
startTok I note in particular that when you talk about the international law with which the text would not be compatible, you are referring in fact to the rules of the World Trade Organisation. endTok	54.17053866970008
startTok The arguments of the US Government concern the fact that a future ban on the presence of dangerous substances in electrical and electronic waste would be contrary to the WTO rules. endTok	67.52743439623075
startTok This worries me because this means that, when adopting texts, we are going to be continually threatened by attack from the World Trade Organisation. This will fundamentally weaken European environmental legislation and particularly this proposal. endTok	80.91210773131967
startTok Thank you for the follow-up question. endTok	34.738984527875694
startTok It is important for me to have a chance to answer it. endTok	17.02728693560345
startTok It is clear that in a process such as this, where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in Europe, there is an on-going dialogue between the different parties concerned. endTok	52.337212781153106
startTok The dialogue has been fruitful and has led to our preparing a proposal. endTok	50.01960495205015
startTok Parts of it have been strengthened, but other parts may well contain too many compromises. endTok	138.37625538369468
startTok We are still in the process of preparing a text, and the dialogue with the relevant parties will continue up until the last moment. endTok	64.00570777300237
startTok I do not think that the intervention of the United States should push us in a direction that would lead to our taking insufficient account of environmental considerations. endTok	29.014479269478667
startTok I strongly oppose using the WTO and trade rules as a pretext for preventing the EU from introducing radical environmental standards. endTok	126.74170100329833
startTok I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these. endTok	52.71004685907307
startTok However, I do want to listen to all the points of view. endTok	25.0298395010793
startTok For example, I recently met representatives of the electronics industry who put forward suggestions - including practical ones - for improving our own proposal. endTok	110.23845349695374
startTok However, I totally reject any suggestion that I would allow the United States to determine the shape of our directive. endTok	45.21826174512523
startTok In fact, I believe that we should be showing the way, an intention that will also characterise the final proposal. endTok	42.171102852567415
startTok Question No 42 by (H-0026/00): endTok	5.847191893683514
startTok Subject: Gender and environment Practically all the contributors involved in the Rio and Kyoto processes - individual organisations, civic action groups, governments, the World Bank, the UN and relief organisations - believed that women should take a greater part in decision-making on the environment. endTok	114.53817183464334
startTok More women in decision-making positions on various environmental bodies would extend the predominantly male terms of reference beyond business alone to embrace social justice as well. endTok	138.20454243561392
startTok Is the Commission prepared to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of women in decision-making in the environmental field? endTok	23.98810742723092
startTok In 1988, the Commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men. endTok	33.10743915917222
startTok Through the current programme, which covers the period 1997 to 2000, we are endeavouring to encourage a workplace culture in which the value of both men and women is integrated and where gender-specific needs are taken into consideration. endTok	77.94383494435482
startTok One of the programme's aims is to develop and supervise methods, strategies and measures for promoting gender equality in the decision-making process and in positions of responsibility. endTok	67.47892704484735
startTok Within the framework of the action plan, each individual directorate general is to prepare its own programme of measures. endTok	65.15094385789915
startTok One of the goals of those programmes is to increase the number of women in managerial positions. endTok	52.11739865540876
startTok The new Commission's own objective is to double the number of women managers before the end of its term of office. endTok	47.4579458967494
startTok The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment, where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women. endTok	37.59898167276352
startTok Our policy is to encourage the recruitment of women to administrative posts in order to create a reserve of suitable candidates for future promotion to managerial positions. endTok	54.95921254556247
startTok Currently, women hold 24.5 per cent of our A-grade posts, and we hope the number will increase steadily. endTok	120.6041108682938
startTok Moreover, we are trying hard to attract qualified women to participate in our consultation groups. endTok	80.81235789451257
startTok As regards our external partners, all we can do is set them a good example and encourage their efforts to democratise their decision-making processes. endTok	79.55450883242632
startTok With respect to the general principle of incorporating a perspective of equality, as you know, this principle is included in the Treaty of Amsterdam. endTok	38.51429945653785
startTok Article 3 of the Treaty states that, in all the activities referred to in this Article, the Community shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between women and men. endTok	54.59867072416118
startTok The Commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field. endTok	41.02214502209325
startTok I should, of course, like to take this opportunity to say that I appreciate the role played by the European Parliament' s Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, particularly its chair. endTok	21.19932082951515
startTok I should just like to recall that, during the lengthy process of approving the present Commission, every Commissioner was questioned by the Women' s Committee on how they would tackle the issue of equality within their own particular field. endTok	50.99219455599341
startTok We shall be monitoring each Commissioner carefully, so the other Commissioners have now been forewarned. endTok	91.49326767969723
startTok Thank you for your reply. endTok	9.993457870664631
startTok I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields. endTok	51.61025229961757
startTok I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes. endTok	29.349403503846876
startTok Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work. endTok	136.9987040185068
startTok I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes. endTok	33.321447783579906
startTok This is a crucial goal. endTok	15.848519150544881
startTok In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality, it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required. endTok	73.4041485289443
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok (SV) My understanding of mainstreaming is, of course, that this should characterise everything we do. endTok	93.94279052598368
startTok In the action plan prepared by my Directorate-General, issues of equality play a very important role. endTok	75.19280023163894
startTok For example, I am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the Commission. endTok	56.924950464481455
startTok If we are to be able to motivate everybody, I believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or, if you prefer, from the bottom up. endTok	43.723998648513295
startTok My impression of environment-related work, broadly speaking, is that in many instances it is dominated by women. endTok	108.43289228650055
startTok This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field. endTok	68.48831266214472
startTok I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention, but there is certainly room for improvement. endTok	39.220187398471445
startTok I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up. endTok	85.0635779249922
startTok I hope that this will be of benefit. endTok	30.459467223955322
startTok Question No 43 by (H-0045/00): endTok	9.804747590551084
startTok Subject: The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. endTok	64.66600939374719
startTok However, the Department of the Marine, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the SPA and even the elimination of a mudflat at Stegrennan recently added to the SPA specifically at the Commission's insistence. endTok	42.101523718698566
startTok What is more, a very large warehouse has been constructed, in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation. endTok	41.33741990804861
startTok How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area? endTok	51.78120297198263
startTok Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely, pending a review of the development plans of the area? endTok	92.78773318009989
startTok The Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour, but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable Member. endTok	26.401719889233622
startTok The harbour construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chiefly involves dredging the river Boyne Estuary and depositing the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan. endTok	84.98537081387443
startTok The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive. endTok	47.148918050975084
startTok That means that any development that takes place in or near the Boyne Estuary and that is likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criteria for the area laid down in the Community' s Habitats Directive. endTok	52.580526814542175
startTok Since 1998, the Commission has received a number of complaints alleging that the harbour will damage the mudflats at Stegrennan, which are now designated a part of the special protection area, and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed. endTok	58.81826289939482
startTok After investigating these complaints between 1998 and the beginning of 1999 - during which time the project did not receive support from the Structural Funds - the Commission became convinced, in the summer of 1999, that the relevant protection criteria had been observed during the building of the harbour. endTok	104.39157923420835
startTok An in-depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out. endTok	65.35409238824732
startTok The most serious harm caused by the project, the damage to the Stegrennan mudflats, was only to be temporary, and the developers were liable for completely restoring the mudflats. endTok	67.3333892080926
startTok At the Commission's suggestion, the mudflats at Stegrennan were formally included in the Boyne Estuary special protection area, from which they had previously been excluded. endTok	88.60637569482434
startTok Furthermore, to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats, the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved. endTok	60.593202704052175
startTok However, since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute. endTok	148.29876988200547
startTok Firstly, the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements. endTok	77.84028354265048
startTok They then renewed their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the Irish courts. endTok	98.81659274807248
startTok However, the new commitment included some minor changes which, in turn, led to a further complaint. endTok	75.02754840225136
startTok In view of the fact that the Irish authorities have undertaken to make compensatory improvements and that other issues have already been resolved, the Commission will not, for the present, propose that financial support from the Structural Funds should be suspended. endTok	36.56266484879828
startTok However, it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the Irish authorities, particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish courts. endTok	48.45108227457972
startTok - I do not quite understand what the Commissioner said. endTok	34.85922925844127
startTok The mudflat at Stregrennan, which was made a special protection area at the request of the Commission, has been completely destroyed at this stage. endTok	42.36979143859326
startTok It is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of EU directives. endTok	31.037270927332127
startTok You say there will be no further funding. endTok	72.86226520229994
startTok I would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation. endTok	32.20298821259458
startTok If not, why not? endTok	115.78518732410045
startTok If you are, when exactly are you going to do it? endTok	48.11015101121092
startTok Is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence, and also the authority which basically takes the money from the EU and gives it to a company that it owns 100%? endTok	104.94562751157491
startTok Is this right and proper? endTok	111.35818137251326
startTok What is your opinion on that? endTok	48.67924283900748
startTok Any EU funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of EU directives. endTok	74.06143297698179
startTok Even the area designated by the Commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed. endTok	61.92031356509636
startTok Compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done. endTok	42.04065847472763
startTok The first legal challenge followed the start of work on the port of development in early autumn 1999 without the compensatory habitat improvements being in place. endTok	80.38242202747239
startTok As a result, the Irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means. endTok	63.70730659292149
startTok The use of mechanical means led to a further legal challenge - that is what I referred to also in my first answer - based on the argument that mechanical removal would damage the underlying mudflats and would cause the ecologically-harmful spread of cord grass in the estuary. endTok	89.90928624219187
startTok There is to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge. endTok	62.541325194214245
startTok The adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities, and does not require prior Commission approval. endTok	58.14193589897953
startTok The Commission' s role is to make sure that the standards required by the Birds Directive are fully met, and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measures which were themselves damaging. endTok	44.8404270795693
startTok In this case, the Commission proposes to seek further clarification from the Irish authorities on the up-to-date position on the compensatory measures and possible problems with the mechanical removal of cord grass. endTok	63.098812983775126
startTok We are not at the moment ready to propose to stop the financing from the Structural Funds. endTok	28.284501512464665
startTok Mr President, sadly, the specific case raised by Mrs McKenna is not an isolated one. endTok	48.366551900467414
startTok There are other examples of conservation in special scientific areas being damaged as a result of EU funding. endTok	55.66847164921014
startTok Will the Commission consider issuing instructions to all Member States saying that, if in future it discovers that European environmental directives have been breached or proper environmental assessment has not been carried out, it will not only stop future funding but will withdraw the funding already granted, in other words, reclaim the money from the Member States? endTok	69.62804282608239
startTok It is only such action which will discourage this practice in the future. endTok	38.626737991862406
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok (SV) This is a very important question. endTok	22.578501571525084
startTok As MEPs are well aware, in the course of last year a joint text was issued by our predecessors in the Commission, Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies concerning the relationship between the Structural Funds, money from the Structural Funds and protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives. endTok	44.310265339363475
startTok The message contained in the joint text is still valid. endTok	47.87750012310299
startTok We cannot hand out money with one hand and, with the other, take countries to court, where they may well be fined. It is therefore important that there be a coordination strategy. endTok	114.55909169445506
startTok The result may, of course, be some difficult questions of priorities. endTok	126.46165218554911
startTok In my view, the most important consequence, however, is that countries should do some careful thinking and, above all, make sure they send in their lists of Natura 2000 sites. endTok	99.40231997571003
startTok Then we will be in a position to carry out methodical monitoring and follow-up procedures. endTok	35.468627619569396
startTok In that respect, Ireland falls short, like other Member States, but we hope that the pressure we are exerting will produce results. endTok	76.42937641206544
startTok I should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good. endTok	33.305959702332416
startTok The Rules of Procedure do not allow this. endTok	29.545423809808952
startTok You will have to discuss this outside the Chamber. endTok	53.89420060865953
startTok Questions to Mr Barnier endTok	221.06052798981233
startTok - endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok Question No 44 by (H-0020/00): endTok	6.770338227450282
startTok Subject: Partnership arrangements and the third community support framework for Greece The recent Regulation (EC) 1260/1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds places greater emphasis than the previous regulation on stronger partnership, involving the regional and local authorities and other public bodies, the economic and social partners and all other relevant bodies not only in the preparation but also in the funding, monitoring and assessment of the measures taken. endTok	81.41231862917532
startTok However, local authorities have repeatedly expressed the view that 'partnership' arrangements under the new CSF for Greece have remained unchanged and are singularly lacking in substance. endTok	85.95841396527491
startTok Has the Greek Government introduced any changes so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangements to the local authorities and other representative bodies? endTok	101.037465159074
startTok In what way have the local authorities be given a greater say in the preparation and administration of the third CSF and what steps will the Commission take to ensure greater participation by the 'partners' in all measures taken under the new CSF? endTok	75.91140643841791
startTok May I quickly add something to the answer given just now by Mrs Wallström to Mr Martin? endTok	99.29648761492236
startTok This was a joint letter between our two predecessors and I consider, as the successor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies, that this letter is still valid. I will actively endeavour with Mrs Wallström to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the Structural Funds with the EU environmental directives and policies. endTok	56.482576440835885
startTok I am also saying this as a former environment minister. endTok	34.34243362560552
startTok Turning now to the question posed by Mr Alavanos, who I hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject, the Commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor, during the preparation of the new programming period, the application of the partnership principle. endTok	58.0276581569598
startTok The involvement of regional and local authorities in the Community' s action is, as you know, one of the essential elements of the new post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation. endTok	45.59885612838539
startTok With regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next Community support framework for Greece, the Commission has noted that the public authorities were largely involved during the preparation of the Greek regional development plan for the 2000-2006 period. endTok	44.78602260319712
startTok Mr Alavanos knows that I have been to Greece twice under the quite tragic circumstances of the earthquake disaster. During these visits, I held discussions with the Greek Government and raised this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement. endTok	110.41068830481134
startTok As for subsequent phases, in other words the preparation of national and regional programmes, it is not enough for this objective to be taken into account at national and theoretical level. It must also be specifically included in the programmes establishing the CSF at national, regional and local level. endTok	38.61423374339828
startTok As for the monitoring and management of these programmes, I have not yet received the national provisions proposed by the Greek Government pursuant to Article 8 of the new Regulation. endTok	35.87758386845494
startTok In the current negotiations on this third Community support framework, I have asked for the provisions on the partnership principle to be fully respected, with regard to both regional and local authorities and to non-governmental organisations and associations. endTok	45.153224426915465
startTok Within the third CSF, this principle must specifically lead to the participation of all these partners in the monitoring committee. endTok	64.7510469484755
startTok This is all I can say. endTok	29.9430854908777
startTok I thank the Commissioner, and do not at all question his intentions and interventions, which adopted a positive line. endTok	97.74463967627645
startTok However, things are really quite different. endTok	112.12421880895205
startTok The operation of the Community Support Framework is ruled by a centralising hand and indeed at this time we are experiencing state, government and party delirium as regards the European Union' s funding. endTok	67.25942308615517
startTok I cannot show you the television programmes here but I can show you the Greek newspapers from a few weeks before the elections. endTok	71.03055672238847
startTok In the Sunday papers all over Greece: the Ministry of Public Works concerning the structural fund: the Minister' s work; the Ministry of Agriculture: the Minister' s work - just a few weeks before the elections - the Ministry of Telecommunications: the work of the Minister for Telecommunications; the Ministry of Education: the work of the Minister for Education and a photograph of the Minister; the Ministry of Employment: the work of the Minister for Employment, a photograph of the Minister and a photograph of the State Secretary, and behind them all the symbols of the Community Support Framework. endTok	60.55934946226441
startTok There are only a few weeks to go before the elections. endTok	41.25434187521164
startTok This is both propaganda by the party and propaganda by the candidates, financed by the European Union, the CSF. endTok	37.79122673327176
startTok My question to the Commissioner is this: what is to be done? endTok	36.84051308980309
startTok Will the Commission remain silent? endTok	48.040370152447174
startTok Will it discuss the matter? endTok	80.78554244727616
startTok Will it bring it up with the Greek Government or will we persist with the pathological situation we had with the previous Commission? endTok	71.91837308986405
startTok Mr Alavanos, I see that you have thrown to your left all the documents which you have just cited. endTok	69.09528592677916
startTok Would you let me have these documents so that I can read them, after I have had them translated? I can then determine what they contain in terms of information and communication, which I can only welcome as the Commissioner for Regional Policy, and what is propaganda. endTok	76.12109736134
startTok Then if it is really necessary for me to do this, I will make comments or recommendations to the Greek Government. endTok	52.96288467931402
startTok I would therefore be very pleased if you could pass me these documents or I will come and get them from you later on. endTok	116.25709349173984
startTok Having said that, I thought your question related more to the partnership issue. endTok	121.37921799082983
startTok Further to your questions on the pre-electoral period, I can only repeat my intention that local and regional authorities should be involved together with non-governmental organisations. endTok	57.10402863044143
startTok I can only quote what is contained in the general Structural Funds Regulation which specifies that the Commission will work with the governments of the Member States. It is therefore the Greek Government which is my primary partner. endTok	34.53213648432025
startTok Subsequently, if I need to ensure that this partnership is disseminated and decentralised, then I will do this. endTok	55.00021494706405
startTok I cannot do other than work with the Greek Government. endTok	75.55638278991978
startTok I think that my colleague Mr Alavanos will be giving all these particulars to the Commissioner so that he may be aware of them, because this really is propaganda and not just some way of promoting Community programmes. endTok	48.111057177698456
startTok However, turning to the substance, I should like to ask the Commissioner to bear in mind the following: that for all national and regional programmes, Greece is regarded as a region which expresses itself - at the level of its partnership relations with the European Union - via its central administration, its central government. endTok	56.94104909187875
startTok From that point of view, neither local governments and much less non-governmental organisations, for example the farming cooperatives which would be interested in further development of the farming sector, have any involvement in the formulation of proposals for the third Community Support Framework, nor have they had any involvement in the previous CSFs. endTok	76.44545006772539
startTok What can the Commission do about that? endTok	52.20579581126589
startTok Mr Theonas, I can only repeat what I said to Mr Alavanos. endTok	26.888731010636448
startTok I will monitor this situation very closely. If necessary, within and pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation, I will make comments on the use made, not of Structural Funds which are not yet committed, but of the negotiations prior to the allocation of these Structural Funds. endTok	73.95517507810419
startTok However, I am obliged to respect the national authority with which I must conduct these negotiations. endTok	60.61877848534048
startTok Having said this, I will look at the situation objectively. endTok	62.89187779541225
startTok As for the rest, if you have any recommendations or suggestions on the involvement of a particular structure - I think you spoke of a cooperative structure - I am ready and willing, on the basis of suggestions from MEPs - you will be acting within your role and I within mine - to relay these suggestions, provided that they respect the spirit and letter of the Structural Funds Regulation. endTok	84.27693802481167
startTok Why would I not say that we have noticed in previous years, on the part of the Greek Government, some shortcomings in the application of the new Regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society? endTok	50.902611873883785
startTok I am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted, this must be remedied. endTok	66.55968982044558
startTok I will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new Community support framework. endTok	28.017230621354898
startTok - endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok Question No 45 by (H-0041/00): endTok	6.5648918908374725
startTok Subject: Structural Fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field Can the Commission confirm that in the last Structural Fund programming period, 1994-1999, no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas? endTok	90.14706861795507
startTok Can it also undertake to rule out any measures providing financing for research of this type during the negotiations in progress with the Member States on the plans and programmes for the new 2000-2006 period? endTok	69.1566938317264
startTok What role will aid from the Structural Funds play, on the other hand, in the promotion of renewable energy? endTok	45.30312206447058
startTok Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional, renewable energy sources? endTok	100.1667999384785
startTok Will the Structural Funds also finance the large-scale energy transmission networks? endTok	86.33616875938304
startTok On Mrs Isler Béguin' s first point I must remind her that the improvement of the scientific basis and technical capacities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the Community' s priorities during the previous programming period. endTok	46.001009833559976
startTok The support allocated by the Structural Funds for technological cohesion, or research and technical developments, within the Community support frameworks for that period is estimated at approximately EUR 7.5 billion. endTok	64.13833361152734
startTok This is about 6% of the whole Community contribution. endTok	57.84416644637169
startTok With regard to your specific concern, I can say that, as in the previous period, the Commission does not intend to directly finance through the Structural Funds research and technical development in the area of nuclear fusion or fission. endTok	31.702600921351504
startTok However, it is still the responsibility of the Member States' management authorities to select the projects to be implemented within these CSFs. endTok	42.70838395474682
startTok Consequently, even though this is not a Community priority, a Member State can decide to finance research and development projects in the civil nuclear technology area, provided that these projects contribute to regional development. The Commission does not have to be systematically informed of these. endTok	60.78048762674143
startTok On your second point of renewable energy which, as you know, is of great interest to me, the Commission' s approach is given in the document on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Funds. endTok	52.57923560442381
startTok These Funds specify that investments in the renewable energy sector must be encouraged where they favour the development of local resources, where they contribute to reducing dependency on energy imports and where they create jobs at local level. endTok	70.9040295851978
startTok I was able to verify this, for example, during a visit I made to the Azores in Portugal a few days ago with regard to a natural source of renewable energy. endTok	44.59318110936985
startTok The Structural Funds contribution which has enabled greater penetration of the renewable energy market was also underlined in the campaign to promote renewable energy sources launched by the Transport and Energy Department. endTok	107.52167050339617
startTok Finally, on large-scale energy transmission networks, the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the Funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation. endTok	96.70736913539966
startTok This is particularly valid for the region of the Azores which I have just mentioned and also for all most remote regions. It is also valid for certain regions handicapped by their isolation due to mountains, for example. endTok	41.679059273655135
startTok Commissioner, thank you for your answer. However, I asked this question because we are rightly concerned that the report on the third framework programme for research contains a project entitled 'International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor' . endTok	63.26246208083577
startTok This project amounts to several billion ecus and areas eligible for Structural Funds, such as those listed in Objective 1, might welcome this type of installation. endTok	93.95976952179903
startTok We would like to know whether the Commission would be likely to finance this type of project in terms of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific 'nuclear research' context. endTok	48.42311228328922
startTok You did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks. endTok	60.79605316563627
startTok Could you please give an answer on this issue? endTok	29.277243757284232
startTok You are concerned about whether the Structural Funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere. endTok	43.309089065963
startTok Quite simply there is no question of this. endTok	26.627963363591576
startTok I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation. endTok	31.374480952653638
startTok As a result, the Commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected. endTok	65.11041482910171
startTok However, you are right to question me as this is your task, as mine is to answer you. endTok	110.38999961126478
startTok As has happened in the past, the Member States are required to provide answers when the Commission questions them or asks for clarification. endTok	64.80698700072286
startTok I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point. endTok	64.06066789559999
startTok The Member State or States concerned will then be required to answer me and I will send you this answer as soon as possible. endTok	74.4576312180498
startTok I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks. endTok	54.566176105926075
startTok The energy situation varies widely from region to region in the European Union. Assistance from the Structural Funds could be justified in certain cases and for certain regions, particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped. endTok	82.81062366862194
startTok This is the only answer I can give you on the link between large-scale energy transmission networks and the Structural Funds. endTok	28.748767432439355
startTok - endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok Question No 46 by (H-0052/00): endTok	10.411406095445594
startTok Subject: Structural Funds and additionality In the light of the Commission's recent helpful response to my priority Written Question about Structural Funds and additionality, I wish to ask whether the Commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality. endTok	82.48789364278281
startTok In particular, would the Commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of Member States but also within Member States, with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries? endTok	62.681287238602785
startTok Mr MacCormick, the Commission has no plans to amend the rules concerning additionality which were stipulated, for the 2000-2006 period, in Article 11 of the general Regulation on the Funds. endTok	45.44480524220599
startTok As in the past, these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all development expenditure of the Member State. endTok	47.81089497851123
startTok In this respect, it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds which must be additional. endTok	22.425201305767022
startTok The cofinancing provided by the Member State does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure. endTok	37.34251337185693
startTok Provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds are added to the national expenditure and the principle of additionality is therefore respected. endTok	46.08881154848502
startTok As for the budgetary provisions within the Member States, between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries, these are determined according to exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality within the meaning defined in the rules. endTok	115.15238653200034
startTok Please excuse this very legal answer. endTok	174.7767366601422
startTok However, after verification it is precisely in this legal manner and specifically according to the post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation that we must define and read the additionality principle. endTok	69.92892987401083
startTok - I am grateful for a clear answer though naturally a little disappointed by its content. endTok	53.269844780799524
startTok We are left with Article 11(1) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the Member States. endTok	81.86107268121825
startTok Very well: that is to be the unchanging rule. endTok	44.799275738214355
startTok Does section 11(1) conceivably authorise the following practice. endTok	534.8558138910864
startTok When an autonomous region's or country's funding from European structural funds increases, the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region, so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the Union. endTok	101.89548390870362
startTok Is that really authorised? endTok	451.0806621951437
startTok Unfortunately I do not have time to go into depth on this issue. If Mr MacCormick would be satisfied with my partial agreement with his reasoning, I will give him a full answer in writing by restating the legal bases of both Article 11 in general and Article 11(1) in particular. endTok	58.64857299051471
startTok I am aware of the Member' s competence on these matters. endTok	33.747098186918564
startTok I also know the particular problems in your constituency in Scotland where disputes and discussions are occurring on these subjects. endTok	77.71830094922724
startTok However, on a general level, I would say that in all cases it is the Structural Funds expenditure which must be additional. This is how, provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds can be added to the national expenditure and we can consider that the additionality principle is respected. endTok	41.61788197668657
startTok I will go further in the written answer which I have promised in order to set things out more objectively and precisely. endTok	70.83323368155095
startTok - Additionality is a major issue too in Wales, which I represent. endTok	64.40210705758744
startTok Just last week it was one of the issues that brought about a vote of no-confidence and the resignation of the First Secretary of the National Assembly of Wales. endTok	58.347151586014824
startTok As recently as 1991 and 1992 the Commission won a battle with the UK over additionality, at that time linked to the RECHAR funding. endTok	115.7461047604048
startTok This led to an agreement being signed whereby the UK Government agreed to introduce procedures to ensure that EU spending reached the areas for which is was intended and was actually additional. endTok	167.9052335940055
startTok And yet we still have these problems in Wales and in Scotland. endTok	38.856556359028204
startTok Could the Commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the UK Government? endTok	36.20864888870362
startTok I take this to mean that the debate of which I was aware in Scotland is also occurring in Wales. endTok	54.17830129881681
startTok I will verify this point and, if you wish, I will give you a written answer at the same time as the one I have promised to Mr MacCormick. endTok	51.97991536003798
startTok Question No 47 by (H-0088/00): endTok	8.377054721339741
startTok Subject: Amount which Andalusia will receive from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period According to the Commission' s estimates and on the basis of the criteria established at the Berlin Summit (which include per capita GDP, the unemployment rate and the population census updated in accordance with the 1996 register of inhabitants), what amount is to be allocated to Andalusia from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period? endTok	58.91777265039042
startTok Questions to Mr Bolkestein endTok	195.30591559869714
startTok Mr President, I will try to be brief in answering the Member' s question. The regional development plan submitted by the Spanish authorities on 29 October does not indicate how the Community funds will be allocated among the Spanish Objective 1 regions and therefore what your region of Andalusia will receive. endTok	96.7862095121603
startTok As I did not fully understand the plan, I contacted the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Mr Rato, in a letter of 14 December which I have here, to ask him for more information on the document submitted. endTok	46.66823923794267
startTok In the coming weeks, the Commission will start negotiations with the Spanish authorities with a view to drawing up the Community support framework for the new period of 2000-2006. During these meetings I can assure you that the Commission will obtain the clarifications required on the regional allocation. endTok	34.73410652540339
startTok Therefore, if you wish, as soon as I have this information by sector and region, I will personally send you the information on Andalusia. endTok	152.17360844157605
startTok Mr Commissioner, the problem is that when Mr Aznar comes to the European Union to receive money for all the people of Andalusia, he counts all of them, but when he goes to the Andalusia Council to pay for services, he fails to notice 400 000 Andalusians, and this is very serious, because 400 000 children are the equivalent to the whole of Strasbourg or a city larger than Granada, full of children. endTok	79.10338536902742
startTok This question is very important and I would like to know - since this is a kind of 'baby fraud' - whether the Commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the Andalusians, so that the funds which the European Union are going to pay to Andalusia, based on the census, will take into account these 400 000 children which Aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services. endTok	36.62976175008121
startTok Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly Community matters. endTok	38.89529970374562
startTok I know that these are very important issues in Spain and there are differing viewpoints. endTok	28.47480798007255
startTok I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government. endTok	13.87636501991109
startTok You may answer the question. endTok	100.333584625614
startTok Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I hear that you have a strong voice. I hope it is loud enough to be heard in Madrid for I realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me. endTok	54.68071549787245
startTok I have given you my answer. endTok	54.28498530278344
startTok I am keen that the Structural Funds, particularly those in Objective 1, are allocated where needed. endTok	99.31831755972769
startTok We have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive. endTok	100.90592741872467
startTok I can only say that I must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country. I am not avoiding the issue but I must abide by the general Regulation. endTok	29.719503180468507
startTok It is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible. endTok	78.07730254822208
startTok I need to know about this allocation, however, and this is why I said that I could not answer today. endTok	38.1813469797693
startTok As I did not have an answer, I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December. endTok	28.327341983006427
startTok I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it. endTok	105.82815475142597
startTok I regret that the Commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and, in this case, passionate intervention. endTok	37.04833408503524
startTok I would like to remind all of you that Spain is about to hold elections, and in fact there are just 25 days left before the elections. endTok	78.65155714141024
startTok It should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time, since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again. endTok	48.98221726387564
startTok I do believe it is important to say that Andalusia is going to receive 50% more within the Community support framework and that Spain also holds the record for the use of the Structural Funds, which means that the distribution is based strictly on the implementing regulations and is decentralised by means of the regional development plans and different Community support frameworks. endTok	47.33591393068536
startTok Lastly I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question: Do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable? endTok	43.645093059073844
startTok This is a fascinating debate which I realise is not totally Community-related. endTok	53.27362967042282
startTok Having said this, we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union. endTok	20.160448050715857
startTok I am pleased that the Structural Funds are the subject of discussions in Greece and Spain. endTok	31.951247502074892
startTok We were talking a short while ago in this House about debates involving our citizens, about public debates. endTok	189.79607798286997
startTok The more we talk about Europe and what Europe is doing for daily life, even when we disagree, the better this will be, provided that we talk about this objectively. endTok	94.70171745506316
startTok I am not going to give an opinion on any amendment to the Structural Funds Regulation. endTok	16.897603421944797
startTok This Regulation was adopted just last year in Berlin and I will be applying it for the next seven years. endTok	47.853192589469806
startTok We will talk about this issue during the cohesion report which I regard as an important time for making an assessment with and before this House and for outlining future prospects. The time will come at the beginning of next year for any amendments to be highlighted. endTok	72.41303343047483
startTok For the time being, please let me apply the Regulation which has not yet been applied as it was only approved in Berlin. endTok	68.8099608706883
startTok This is all I can say today. endTok	28.489455453588825
startTok Thank you very much for your replies, Mr Barnier. endTok	19.16190611270968
startTok Questions Nos 48 to 50 will be replied to in writing. endTok	82.96053407805601
startTok Question No 51 by (H-0049/00): endTok	7.520500735064861
startTok Subject: New premises for the OHIM At present the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) is still operating from the same temporary premises, even though its new building was opened in June 1999. endTok	83.69117703580889
startTok In view of this unusual situation, will the Commission say why the OHIM has not yet moved to its new premises? endTok	36.74815675257383
startTok The honourable Member asked a question on this topic in November 1999 and I would like to refer him to the answer given at the time. endTok	32.513917676588456
startTok Furthermore, I have asked the president of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, that is to say the Office in Alicante, to comment further on this new question and I can, as a result, inform the honourable Member as follows, on behalf of the Office: endTok	48.13286767331463
startTok The Office is not yet ready to move into the new building. endTok	59.43675327006468
startTok Unfortunately, a number of deadlines have been exceeded. endTok	33.49452869537444
startTok A number of technical provisions need to be made, such as the installation of a computer network, archives, a canteen and furniture. endTok	26.7715992116402
startTok The OHIM is now in the process of arranging this and is expecting to move into the new premises by June. endTok	44.6751001877827
startTok During the previous question, we were discussing electoral issues. endTok	76.30596619586437
startTok I believe that this issue is relevant to my question. Commissioner, you were not present at the extraordinarily named 'official opening' of the headquarters of the OHIM on 9 June, in the middle of an election campaign in Spain leading up to both the European elections and the local and regional elections. endTok	47.42689677824889
startTok If you had been there, I am sure you would have been ashamed. endTok	41.11358632894419
startTok The President of the Commission and some secretaries were present. endTok	30.33118437687498
startTok In the middle of an election campaign, a series of authorities, all of them run by the party in government, made clearly electioneering speeches which, furthermore, were broadcast live on television. endTok	110.91520423722181
startTok It was bizarre to see the President of the Region of Valencia praising the work of the Spanish Government, as well as his own work, although it was irrelevant to that event. endTok	32.056522943784174
startTok The opening of a building which was not finished, in the middle of an election campaign, which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied, makes the Spanish Government look ridiculous. endTok	81.78456199762869
startTok I am not worried that the Spanish Government should look foolish, because at the end of the day it was their responsibility, but it does worry me that the Commission should look foolish by endorsing, through its presence, this absurd event. endTok	47.70326151427738
startTok I would therefore like to ask you, Mr Commissioner: does it seem normal to you that an unfinished building should be opened during an election campaign? endTok	43.55478102694871
startTok Does it seem normal to you that the Commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the Spanish Government? endTok	52.751270342336454
startTok It does not fall within my remit to make statements about internal political situations within one Member State or another. endTok	79.64374295822232
startTok As such, I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer has just described. endTok	27.74139788596666
startTok I have to confess that I fail to comprehend why a certain opening ceremony was held in Spain. endTok	54.69902236720388
startTok What I can say is that I hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible. endTok	22.34290300801177
startTok May I also add that I hope to be in Alicante myself at the end of May to speak at a conference. endTok	54.68488746453617
startTok I hope that this building will then be occupied. endTok	29.92024230843493
startTok I would like to point out to the Commissioner that it is not an electoral question. endTok	11.80205184187882
startTok As members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we have followed the creation of that institution and it is clear that it was established for electioneering reasons. endTok	19.282533130273414
startTok A year later, it is still not functioning, which means that the Commission spent money on a false opening. endTok	95.09059552761336
startTok We should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified. endTok	54.02847656964051
startTok I would like to reiterate that the Commission is unconcerned with the underlying motivation of Member State actions. endTok	19.355256917899357
startTok It is, however, interested in official statements and actions. endTok	100.43257229528909
startTok We do not intend to go in the direction of what is termed in French un procès d'intention. endTok	60.24006426451411
startTok We are concerned with public official actions and events, rather than any possible underlying motivation. endTok	129.79487929802542
startTok This is why I find it also difficult to meet Mr Medina halfway and respond to his question. endTok	30.633132534075425
startTok Once again, the Commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned. It only appreciates that a building for this Office is opened and occupied as soon as possible. endTok	82.68424275914896
startTok Also, the Commission does not engage itself in finding out whether certain expenditure was real or virtual. endTok	126.03273221256579
startTok As far as I am concerned, all expenditure is real. endTok	47.67019929311768
startTok And any remaining skeletons, I intend to leave them in the cupboard. endTok	55.46119854696631
startTok Question No 54 by (H-0117/00): endTok	7.520500735064861
startTok Subject: Alcohol monopoly and the internal market What action does the Commission intend to take in order to prevent the extension of the State alcohol monopoly apparently being planned by Sweden, and the associated import restrictions, and to ensure that the rules of the single market are applied? endTok	59.871880547359055
startTok I would like to answer these two questions as follows. endTok	24.664581826353654
startTok When Sweden joined the European Union, it was allowed to retain quantitative restrictions on alcoholic beverages which travellers can bring into the country from other Member States. endTok	50.75906222543302
startTok This derogation from the principle of the free movement of goods lapses on 30 June of this year. endTok	32.343073881327435
startTok Sweden now wants to extend this measure by another five years, as this would be necessary to protect public health. endTok	57.56721624507921
startTok My position on this is clear. endTok	57.03632224586077
startTok Sweden has now had sufficient time - since its accession to the Union - to adapt its policies to a situation where such import restrictions do not exist. endTok	66.64648668325322
startTok I cannot see a reason, therefore, why a further extension for this measure should be proposed. endTok	83.32582950953231
startTok European citizens have the right to buy goods for their own use, including taxes, in any Member Sate and to take them to another Member Sate without having to subject these goods to controls and without possibly having to pay another set of taxes on them. endTok	120.41597486279322
startTok That is a basic principle governing the internal market and derogations from this principle must be exceptions and must be limited in time. endTok	60.48042248668984
startTok We want to guarantee that Swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market, just like other citizens of the European Union. endTok	39.86442847465354
startTok This certainly does not mean that I do not share the concern in Sweden surrounding the possible health problems which can be caused by alcohol abuse. endTok	65.65864157096463
startTok A recent study, carried out by Professor Lindgren of the University of Lund, however, has shown that abolishing the restrictions would not lead to a higher alcohol consumption in Sweden. endTok	61.23143735492242
startTok I have already had a chance to discuss my position with Mr Ringholm, the Swedish Finance Minister on two occasions. endTok	35.83697592460897
startTok I also discussed this matter with the Swedish parliamentary Finance committee last week. endTok	47.38728070931888
startTok It is now up to the Swedish government to take the necessary measures. endTok	27.2401511462362
startTok Thank you for your reply. endTok	9.993457870664631
startTok I should just like to apologise for the error in my question to the Commission. Instead of 2004, it should, of course, be 1 July 2000. endTok	38.73744515813347
startTok I have some sympathy with the Commission's standpoint that derogations should only be granted occasionally. endTok	42.378065575932176
startTok Such a rule is only normal. endTok	115.38664638061812
startTok Nevertheless, I should like to ask two questions: Are you thinking of embarking upon continued discussions with the Swedish Government about extending the derogations, for example for as long as Denmark and Finland have derogations? endTok	91.47917711793708
startTok My second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol. endTok	25.81506417456399
startTok This may, of course, be seen as an issue concerning the internal market, but also as a public health matter for the whole EU. endTok	42.8297478522628
startTok What are the respective roles of alcohol policy and public health considerations in the Commission's work? endTok	56.984318034975594
startTok A Europe-wide policy on alcohol is not just an issue concerning the internal market. It also has important implications for public health. endTok	41.09243852972272
startTok If we had considered these aspects in their overall context, then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with Sweden. endTok	77.3717222635186
startTok May I thank Mr Andersson for the supplement to his first question and may I answer that question as follows? endTok	78.2123785830154
startTok Firstly, Finland and Denmark are subject to exemptions to the basic rule of the free movement of goods until 2003. endTok	64.61139257468524
startTok These countries are in the process of taking measures in preparation of free access of alcoholic products in the year 2003. endTok	46.26601008131747
startTok However, in the case of Sweden, the situation is different. endTok	29.1003496284173
startTok In 1995, a five-year derogation period was decided upon, which is now lapsing. endTok	41.42643291142571
startTok I have as yet not heard any arguments on the basis of which the Commission would need to extend this period. endTok	40.61045342435149
startTok Secondly, the Swedish Government is being consulted all the way. endTok	49.81163856990771
startTok I can inform Mr Andersson that I will leave for Stockholm on Monday, 6 March, in order to talk to Minister Ringholm, to members of the Swedish parliament, and, if necessary, also to the Prime Minister or other ministers, in order to continue discussions on this matter. I am fully aware that emotions are running high in the political arena in Sweden regarding this issue. endTok	51.847528944740915
startTok Thirdly, I understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important. endTok	38.275343200426356
startTok I would repeat at this juncture what Professor Lindgren of Lund University has stated, namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions, the consumption of alcohol will remain the same. endTok	68.58867814913765
startTok The question is then, of course, where does the volume of alcohol originate from which is not imported by travellers? endTok	46.94724545722473
startTok The answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the Swedes themselves, and as Mr Andersson knows, this is an extremely dangerous and unhealthy activity. endTok	44.316509334045946
startTok Well now, Mr Andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol. endTok	123.57358813413558
startTok But in that case, not only Sweden, but all EU countries, should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol. endTok	76.66019843586338
startTok We can cast our minds back to a similar situation in the United States. endTok	33.12957183421254
startTok Mr Andersson will be familiar with what was termed then 'prohibition' . endTok	104.55293404873595
startTok He will also be aware of the effects the ban had on Mafia activity within the United States, where, eventually, prohibition was withdrawn. endTok	69.54966564773191
startTok All this means that we need to protect health, of course, but not by banning alcohol, because that does not work. endTok	77.23305253266116
startTok Mr President, the question at issue is the income from the Swedish alcohol monopoly and when the Swedish Government says that it must cover health costs, then this is proof of a distortion of competition because other countries must cover their health costs themselves, with no alcohol monopoly at their disposal. endTok	113.89176478336313
startTok My question refers to whether you too know of studies which state that a moderate intake of good quality alcohol such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer is good for you and would therefore also be good for the Swedish budget. endTok	115.28616744437417
startTok I gather that Mr Posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter. endTok	38.45630043336014
startTok I also happen to know that the high tax on alcohol products in Sweden goes back to the year 1638 and that since then, the sale of alcohol products has accounted for a significant portion of the state' s tax revenue. endTok	62.79338055734118
startTok As is known, this has led to a state monopoly in Sweden which, in itself, is at odds with Union legislation. endTok	55.539851659855316
startTok As to the healing effect of alcohol - to which, I believe, Mr Posselt also made reference - I could not agree more with him: I think that a good bottle of wine can be extremely good for your health and is also socially extremely pleasant, and perhaps Mr Posselt, Mr Andersson and myself could meet in the bar of this Parliament one of these days to share an aquavit. endTok	83.72199095970021
startTok Mr President, I listened with interest to the Commissioner's reply about the need to apply the laws of the single market. endTok	21.786416271632444
startTok I wonder whether he can say whether he considers his reply to be compatible with the failure by the Commission to take the French Government to the European Court of Justice on the application of France's Loi et Vin, which effectively prevents single market rules applying to the sale of alcohol products in France? endTok	53.010473219912484
startTok Can we now expect the European Commission to take action against the French Republic before the European Court of Justice? endTok	34.21082890839438
startTok I should like to reply very briefly to the question raised by the honourable Member, since this matter is now under active consideration by the Commission. endTok	38.60491804033693
startTok The Commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the European Court of Justice. endTok	37.13635343800052
startTok My reply is perhaps not satisfactory right now, but I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks. endTok	39.54973124727741
startTok I ask for the Member's understanding for this small delay in the Commission's decision. endTok	48.73254370318026
startTok Commissioner, do you have any reason, on public health grounds, for a difference in the taxation rates on, for example, Scotch whisky or French Bordeaux wine or even my colleague's Bavarian beer? endTok	91.25737361420761
startTok Can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe? endTok	183.94780731281085
startTok The matter of excise taxes, to which the honourable Member is referring, is the prerogative of the Member State concerned. endTok	61.73516822385811
startTok The Commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products. endTok	76.2485350830648
startTok Towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between Member States. endTok	26.0404336083036
startTok It will no doubt engage in a discussion both with Parliament and the Council on this state of affairs, which indicates that there are quite a lot of differences in excise rates between Member States. endTok	45.57845467327883
startTok For example - I believe the honourable Member referred to this - no excise taxes are applied on wine in France, whereas they are applied in the United Kingdom. endTok	61.9515007735528
startTok That leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom. endTok	43.90807716747213
startTok The question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax. endTok	169.7757704459453
startTok The Commission has no means of influence here. endTok	42.82977848649663
startTok In the case of Sweden, the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol. endTok	50.05702956264564
startTok Although this leads to a disparity in excise taxes between Sweden and other Member States of the Union - and that by itself increases cross-border smuggling of alcoholic products - it is a legitimate instrument to decrease the consumption of alcohol. endTok	52.392570215254096
startTok There is ,of course, elasticity of demand, in this case a price elasticity of demand. endTok	51.77967214010767
startTok I am not sure exactly what it is, but it is not zero, therefore it must have some effect. endTok	49.26709304752571
startTok My question would have been almost exactly the one raised by Mr Purvis, but I would like to press the point further. endTok	40.808949397486366
startTok Granted, as you say, that excise duties lie within the prerogative of Member States, nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which is unfairly discriminatory against producers in one part of the Community versus others might still conflict with the single market principle. endTok	98.7058299875337
startTok For example, if we take what Mr Purvis and I would be thinking of, the malt whisky producing parts of the Highlands - a very peripheral part of Europe, very hard-pressed, a whole farming community as well as a distilling community dependent upon it - a general practice of taxing the alcohol in Scotch whisky, Dutch gin or Danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine, seems to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which is admittedly within the prerogative of the Member States. endTok	84.77199563539354
startTok May I assure Mr MacCormick and other Members of this Parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between Member States is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market. endTok	35.01633766628746
startTok We need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products. endTok	42.92170825897764
startTok If one looks at petrol, for example, one sees that excise taxes in Germany are different from those of Holland, and consequently Dutch motorists cross the border and fill up their tanks in Germany. endTok	105.05116902927035
startTok That is indeed distortion of the internal market. endTok	20.940780037237435
startTok If I had my way, I would wave a magic wand and equalise excise taxes across Europe. endTok	69.44584083178901
startTok As a result, smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one Member State than another. endTok	59.64073727615592
startTok But I do not have a magic wand and I do not have my way. endTok	18.744226627071644
startTok This is an area of unanimity, as Mr MacCormick knows, and unless all Member States agree on the equalisation of excise taxes, it will not happen. endTok	60.625109073526566
startTok Once again, towards the end of this year, the Commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes, and I am obviously available for any discussion with Parliament on that report. endTok	55.3536150767869
startTok Thank you very much, Commissioner. endTok	6.573406575229789
startTok Today we will take note of what you say and have a glass or two of Alsace wine, although we do not know how much tax is put on it, but I suppose it is a lot. endTok	51.319816952868415
startTok Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 55 to 114 will be replied to in writing. endTok	48.13406116818279
startTok That concludes Questions to the Commission. endTok	29.587119516153184
startTok (The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.) endTok	7.286724872590848
startTok Community policy in the field of water (continuation) endTok	62.54827411270192
startTok The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the Community action in the field of water policy. endTok	14.81645393479766
startTok Mr President, the situation regarding fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but, in general terms, it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease. endTok	39.15524366803888
startTok To this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East. endTok	90.99149397610213
startTok In fact, a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania, threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia. endTok	88.8601164413483
startTok I understand that Mrs Wallström, whose presence here tonight I appreciate, is going to visit the area. endTok	82.07702208538666
startTok I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of this Parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin. endTok	49.468586997446884
startTok The development of this directive has been difficult and complex, involving diverse interests and divided opinions. endTok	100.18738801571475
startTok I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature, Mrs Lienemann, has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions, and has succeeded to a large extent. endTok	59.44820440063376
startTok However, it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations. endTok	69.46919037824077
startTok I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain. endTok	42.95631086395419
startTok The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity, century after century, year after year, day after day, and is still doing so today. endTok	149.69105429693
startTok Therefore, it seems essential to us that the directive complies, in practice, with the obligation laid down in article 164 of the Treaty on the need for Community legislation to take account of the diversity of its regions. endTok	29.264905295647566
startTok In accordance with this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European People' s Party will oppose Amendments Nos 4 (Recital 21), 13 and 49 (Article 11(d)), since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the Member States, that is, the regulation of water resources. endTok	39.68887981396205
startTok It would be very difficult for the Community to determine the conditions for the regulation of water in the different regions, given the different internal balances which are always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different areas and the relevant interests. endTok	48.03977456286602
startTok We also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010. endTok	58.70108833026957
startTok We must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which, at the same time, safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less-favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development. endTok	59.618274760707585
startTok I would lastly like to refer to the amendments on dangerous substances which establish that we must achieve a zero, or close to zero, degree of pollution. endTok	47.27796319084153
startTok In no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution. endTok	127.23435642635606
startTok We will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions. endTok	45.254812890829
startTok I hope that, once again, this House will vote with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity, seeking a suitable balance between the environmental objectives and economic and social considerations, the three essential elements in achieving the sustainable development which we all wish to see so much. endTok	52.77829240557129
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, this is a very important directive. endTok	12.983201507208188
startTok Its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems. endTok	23.86382605294806
startTok The public must have a right to clean water. endTok	41.87529981270759
startTok It is important not only for the environment but also for public health. endTok	20.017933021407377
startTok I am not speaking so much for myself, as I happen to be one of those few lucky people in Europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home. endTok	45.956722484593115
startTok We must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality. endTok	61.06398593103627
startTok Action must get under way immediately. endTok	294.5033377397429
startTok We cannot afford to waste time. endTok	81.85693513925055
startTok It is important that the timetable is an ambitious one. endTok	18.43096226906101
startTok In my opinion, the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then. endTok	63.18037365964619
startTok It is a question of doing what is technically possible; obviously it is not possible to do anymore, but we must be sufficiently ambitious. endTok	39.76284182470991
startTok I would like to comment on one issue, which was spoken about earlier. endTok	25.572591159025688
startTok I believe the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water. endTok	24.625654301494322
startTok This is not merely a problem for Spain; it is one for the Nordic countries, and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters, when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive. endTok	46.629657105607215
startTok Mr President, Madam Commissioner, congratulations, Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work. endTok	56.06804422612837
startTok Water and air surround us everywhere. endTok	116.33439654969165
startTok We share them with everyone on this earth. endTok	98.29466764636224
startTok Water is a prerequisite for human life. endTok	35.45234437094775
startTok And there are more and more of us in the world. endTok	37.01349541363161
startTok Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal. endTok	151.72684805776066
startTok Nothing could be further from the truth! endTok	95.3678162017635
startTok It is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so, too, the conditions for life. endTok	61.87648311423079
startTok It is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources. endTok	57.06496791770954
startTok I would therefore appeal to Members of Parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long-term realism of the highest order. endTok	55.4734443783285
startTok Mr President, we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann, the targets it sets and the directive under discussion. endTok	113.37679098620562
startTok However, we should look a little more closely at some points. endTok	62.15365246714972
startTok For example, a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes, which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental arguments, and which, of course, are a great risk to ground waters, water tables and surface waters. endTok	67.82480647340694
startTok I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place, the specifications common to us all must be very stringent. endTok	81.43526472967926
startTok But the key issue is, in my opinion, planning how to restore water tables, the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes, which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind. endTok	51.33034064586082
startTok I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding, because, at the end of the day, that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy. endTok	48.2476472516331
startTok Mr President, here we have what is basically a good measure. endTok	58.85490334084662
startTok It sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management. endTok	131.52746870780342
startTok Its aim of good-quality water for drinking, for wildlife, the environment and economic purposes is right. endTok	118.93337940965446
startTok The prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood. endTok	60.9763176620038
startTok We have three outstanding problems. endTok	63.64327157144638
startTok The first is the transfer of water between basin areas. endTok	64.91297603117579
startTok That is a matter which affects my colleagues from Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom. endTok	50.99209729619359
startTok Amendments Nos 4. 49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed, be that arid areas or urban areas. endTok	88.00785326054425
startTok Secondly, we have to have realistic targets, but targets nevertheless. endTok	212.87860315041695
startTok Looking at Amendment No 7, for example, which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances, you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic. endTok	88.10220008233016
startTok Also, some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in English, that is quite a meaningless term. endTok	97.52712818399408
startTok We need to look very carefully at those. endTok	39.806303837616746
startTok The concept of continuing reduction as in Amendment No 58 is much better. endTok	68.24381682251231
startTok Thirdly, I raise the problem faced by Scotch whisky. endTok	93.93526519798058
startTok Scotch whisky - especially malt whisky, which is the best - requires water extraction which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream. endTok	124.77562259721851
startTok Some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk. endTok	26.611703213930202
startTok We must make sure that Amendments Nos 49 and 87 leave the deletion exemption so that whisky can continue to be drunk in "high quality", which means it must use good, Scottish peat water. endTok	69.32127712377547
startTok That is my third request - that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole. endTok	60.96785719875947
startTok Mr President, first of all, we want to denounce the fathomless hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned about the environment and water, but whose criminal activities such as the attacks against Yugoslavia, aside from leaving thousands dead and wounded, have also brought about huge ecological disasters for water resources too, making them not only unusable but even extremely hazardous. endTok	91.53664358387346
startTok Turning to the report, we believe that implementing the principle that the cost of water services should be recoverable must never result in additional taxation of the economically weakest strata, or even in the annihilation of small and medium-scale farmers because of the prohibitive cost of water for irrigation. endTok	46.374325548892436
startTok We also wish to point out that especially in areas with acute drought problems such as my own country, and especially on the islands, funding must be provided for infrastructure for the saving of water, by increasing not its cost but its quantity. This should mainly be carried out by collecting the rainwater that now goes to waste, running off into the sea and eroding the soil, with all the problems that creates. endTok	91.54511170170662
startTok In that spirit, we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos. endTok	25.952526835771735
startTok River waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought. endTok	85.04743598980227
startTok Finally, as regards the Council' s allegation, which the Commission echoes, that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein, this is chicanery. endTok	59.158157939186374
startTok Its purpose is to preserve a semi-transparent field of action, which during the directive' s first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalised to the benefit of big business. endTok	76.76228977244457
startTok Mr President, first and foremost, I want to say that protection of the aquatic environment, both surface water and groundwater, is probably one of our most important duties of all. endTok	41.73717193982661
startTok That is not only because it is about guaranteeing sufficient water resources but also because it is, to a large degree, about safeguarding water resources against pollution so that we can also have clean drinking water in the future. endTok	48.98840713838928
startTok We are all entitled to clean drinking water. endTok	36.688793405215876
startTok I should like to express my great appreciation of Mrs Lienemann' s work on this matter. endTok	12.458103467636606
startTok It has been a huge task, and I should like to express my support for all of Mrs Lienemann' s amendments. These are all improvements to the common position. endTok	26.836533939135187
startTok Moreover, I shall only highlight the most important ones. endTok	52.341368174686814
startTok First and foremost, I think it is important that we should establish some clear objectives concerning the condition we should have achieved for our water within a period of no more than 10 years. endTok	46.55375391562793
startTok I also think it is important that we should put pressure on the Member States to devise the necessary action programmes more quickly than is proposed in the common position. endTok	37.47601377213695
startTok And, finally, I want to say that I think that the tighter arrangements which are being introduced in regard to payment schemes and pricing are quite proper if we, as consumers, are to be given an incentive to use water resources efficiently and, at the same time, obtain arrangements which can promote the achievement of those environmental goals about which, I believe, there is broad agreement. endTok	67.58535408417112
startTok In this regard, too, I think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate. endTok	35.286725380123045
startTok Finally, I want to say that I attach great importance to making a start on phasing out discharges, emissions and leaks of hazardous materials and to the fact that we can do this gradually but, at the same time, be set a target, namely the year 2020 by which time we should hopefully have reduced such emissions to zero. endTok	62.901205123311236
startTok If this cannot be adopted as the objective, then I am naturally prepared to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieved levels very close to zero by the year 2020. endTok	42.947145625422806
startTok I think that Mrs Lienemann' s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the Council. endTok	27.473186354776804
startTok Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for some excellent work in drafting this important directive. endTok	12.743210828974354
startTok The second reading of the framework directive on the issue of water is most timely; the shocking news of the environmental catastrophe in Romania must feature in today' s discussions and also more generally when we ponder the environmental dimension of Union enlargement. endTok	72.7186386114444
startTok First of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act. endTok	45.055935109080764
startTok The cyanide and heavy metals in the rivers are gruesome examples of how environmental negligence may ruin the waterways for decades to come. endTok	58.67744081788413
startTok The event proves that in some countries applying for EU membership the environmental norms and environmental thinking are still light years behind the EU. endTok	126.73293820912052
startTok The Union ought to reassess how aid for environmental projects can be allocated in a better way in support of a sustainable policy on water. endTok	56.00295478032674
startTok With regard to the proposal for the directive it is worrying that the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface waters to increase the occurrence of clean, natural groundwater. endTok	20.44674002330221
startTok In Finland surface waters are very clean. endTok	133.03377794533094
startTok The production of so-called artificial groundwater is an ecological means of filtering a clean supply of fresh surface water through to the groundwater reserves. endTok	108.26947317047862
startTok The process does not require a chemical sewage plant. endTok	52.294704470551935
startTok The directive must not be allowed to endanger this work. endTok	22.49636474454776
startTok Deviating from the Council' s common position, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water. endTok	33.61868059205744
startTok This would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed. endTok	60.80562055804417
startTok The ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by Union acts. endTok	89.63951188289393
startTok The work should, of course, be regulated and subject to license in the future too, but the same rules cannot apply to, for example, Finland and Greece, which suffers from drought. endTok	53.239207238142484
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, water is a precious natural asset, a vital necessity, and it is our duty to protect it. endTok	38.23939628692956
startTok I think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the European Union, which will be the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources, and I congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the points of view. endTok	30.051006838107075
startTok I must say, however, that, there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water, and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way. endTok	29.004740936100553
startTok There are parts of Europe with an inherent shortage of water, and that should be taken into account by this directive. endTok	42.45136063611164
startTok In recent years, climate change has compelled Mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain. endTok	60.5530257408209
startTok We agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendments tabled, whose aim is to improve it. endTok	41.31393081250224
startTok However, we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water, granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers. endTok	58.39616686285417
startTok In addition, amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage. endTok	198.65643240595904
startTok The issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought, I think, to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it. endTok	47.828110575762544
startTok As for the time scale demanded for the directive' s implementation, it must be borne in mind that there are countries where creating the infrastructure for this directive' s implementation will take time and considerable resources. endTok	64.60951324613525
startTok In spite of these remarks however, I believe our common objective of sustainable use of water resources can be maintained. endTok	58.03607036871413
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, the measures contained in this directive range from drafting water management plans, comprehensive information and hearing rights, and close cooperation between the Member States, to combating water pollution caused by individual pollutants. endTok	107.65202736341142
startTok And considering how long this Chamber has been trying to introduce a framework directive of this kind, I am pleased to be present here today, and I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on being in the happy position of presenting this report to us. endTok	37.444477641284635
startTok However, it is also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for granted. endTok	50.6985645851619
startTok I would still like to highlight this point though: this directive does not constitute any kind of legal basis for diverting water from a Member State' s territory against its will. endTok	57.830928482379704
startTok And by way of reaffirming this once again, I have introduced an amendment - gratifyingly with the support of a large number of Members - and I would be very pleased if Parliament would endorse my proposed amendment tomorrow. endTok	55.596502180163405
startTok It is all about making it clear that water - and this is not the first time this has been mentioned today - is no ordinary commodity but a resource which belongs to the individual EU Member States and which must be protected and treated with the respect due to it. endTok	39.28397441166155
startTok I am aware, and the previous speaker highlighted this, that there are States in the European Union that have problems with water. endTok	62.93081580540871
startTok I believe that every one of us, in every country, could improve the way in which we manage our water and could make use of it in a cleaner way. endTok	52.46575821178979
startTok This applies to every country. endTok	41.275779654968375
startTok But only when each country has done its utmost to conserve its water resources, when literally everything has been done that could have been done in our own countries, only then, in my view, should it be necessary to start thinking in terms of harmonising water usage. endTok	52.74069424414233
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading. endTok	31.940150337239466
startTok However, I must say that I am not over-pleased because I believe that this directive is not of great quality, it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings. endTok	34.58165290028955
startTok Firstly, I believe that this directive is excessively tough, simplistic and reductionist. endTok	28.81587324620462
startTok In many cases other existing directives on water have not been complied with and governments and the Commission have often not imposed discipline as they should have done, although I know that this is not pleasant. endTok	67.09199256941473
startTok It is not a question of having much tougher regulations, because in many cases the problems concern management. It is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative, the complications of which we are all well aware of. endTok	69.00687930127327
startTok This is a reductionist directive. We cannot lump countries with navigable rivers together with countries which lack water, where great cracks open up in the ground through a lack of water and which see temperatures of 55ºC or 60ºC in the sun. endTok	87.65542184958986
startTok I say this because the ball does not need to be in our court. This issue is in the hands of the governments and the Commission. endTok	30.93433233184239
startTok In the same way, this damage and these tragedies which are happening, as in Romania, are not the problem of the legislative, but of the executive and of the governments. endTok	72.16374815019506
startTok Furthermore, it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large uninhabited areas, climatic diversity, desert areas and arid areas. endTok	74.79964485597918
startTok That is how the common position has been worded. endTok	26.594178513062612
startTok The same can be said with regard to transfers. endTok	50.60160704111875
startTok Transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth, of solidarity between peoples and territories, because unfortunately the Earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less. endTok	115.07043666367562
startTok Lastly, I am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact. endTok	27.457267631443653
startTok It is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but, on environmental questions, we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people, how many farmers, could be ruined by having to pay the costs. endTok	92.58791862273216
startTok Some kind of study has been done which has not even been read, and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice, rather than just laying down doctrine. endTok	73.42231672444886
startTok Mr President, through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union. endTok	42.37120570656229
startTok It is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface, ground, transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and, in our case in Ireland, cross-border level. endTok	89.6152796226275
startTok Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments. endTok	60.23141874994838
startTok A 25-year roll-out for legislation, for example, is hardly acceptable. endTok	133.67755108413476
startTok We have no difficulty with the "polluter pays" principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial, commercial and agricultural level. endTok	45.21633200990817
startTok However, I feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge, a quota per household for drinking, cooking and sanitation. endTok	103.95698057231458
startTok We must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly. endTok	64.79428736722114
startTok The introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in Ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977. endTok	81.78378204298525
startTok Meters could be viewed as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin districts, to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirements. endTok	71.36577772901775
startTok The whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the EU. endTok	28.955946395071198
startTok Water is a scarce and precious natural resource. endTok	38.03752489498751
startTok Ideally, I would like Amendment No 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charges. endTok	80.0626266976406
startTok That would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges, with each Member States drawing up its own scheme, so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected. endTok	76.68111042224373
startTok If Amendment No 45 does not fall, I will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that Member States may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services. endTok	64.77763638853197
startTok All legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance. endTok	88.57963496647058
startTok I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world. endTok	68.97352165150818
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, at this point in the debate I am going to insist on certain aspects which, from an agronomic point of view, and since I come from a southern country, I consider to be absolutely essential to this directive. endTok	36.3979155881652
startTok These include, for example, costs and transfers. endTok	128.36165668590272
startTok With regard to costs, I would like clarification of what costs we are talking about. endTok	37.535066844357196
startTok Are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water? endTok	30.324647789151985
startTok Are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks? endTok	30.806913940374898
startTok Are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services? endTok	51.83677562969075
startTok Or are we talking about large-scale hydraulic works and reservoirs? endTok	49.782776330088645
startTok All these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector. endTok	73.63064404367097
startTok Transfers are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas. endTok	116.06843273458185
startTok Is the Commissioner aware that our country has one of the oldest systems of transfers in Europe? endTok	42.50124692198048
startTok They already existed in ancient times: they had them in Roman times, although on a smaller scale. endTok	93.133039852339
startTok One of the most significant transfers - the Tajo-Segura transfer - which has been in use for many years, almost 30 years, has an allowance of 658 hm3 per year. endTok	48.95717377761363
startTok The largest volume transferred in one year has been 453 and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200. endTok	63.18862892837728
startTok We cannot be accused of bad management. endTok	41.33323148646393
startTok Is the Commissioner aware that, of this 263 hm3, we used 25 for irrigation on the left bank of the Levante, 30 for water supplies in the area of the Júcar, 7 for supplies in the southern area of the Júcar and the rest in the Segura, equally divided between supplies and irrigation? endTok	58.26080013608564
startTok We are not doing a bad job of management. endTok	43.13380472699821
startTok We cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it. endTok	55.78895594884365
startTok I will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies, because I believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive. endTok	31.19956575819582
startTok Take good note: in this diverse Europe, which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation, we have to find diverse solutions, not single solutions. endTok	91.91265624820744
startTok I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission, the Council and this House so that, when voting, they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of Europe in areas where subsidiarity is required. endTok	35.380663682077525
startTok Commissioner, Andalusia is not Lapland. endTok	30.96497720301718
startTok . (SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want, of course, to begin by thanking the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann for the ambitious and constructive work she has put into the present framework water directive. endTok	23.089854677861187
startTok Water is one of our most important natural resources, as many speakers have already said. endTok	29.461197106285972
startTok An ambitious and well-balanced European policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for Europe. endTok	45.11342088628364
startTok Water is also one of the issues to which I shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office. endTok	72.76484031437644
startTok I am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to Parliament. endTok	25.16172310761876
startTok Many of them are based upon the very constructive, informal discussions which have taken place between Parliament and the Council in connection with the first reading. endTok	37.481786212414804
startTok Most of Parliament' s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious. endTok	90.84400723230517
startTok The Commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle. endTok	36.734587782609886
startTok Many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary. endTok	66.70915356376047
startTok With a view to these forthcoming negotiations, I would therefore urge Parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position. endTok	27.109412205583077
startTok Firstly, I should like to mention some of my most important arguments. endTok	20.84104008530918
startTok We now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the OSPAR Convention. endTok	37.7591552746734
startTok Rather than make these objectives legally binding, we must consider their political nature. endTok	105.89938171606319
startTok This is also reflected in many of Parliament' s amendments. endTok	31.193935279318136
startTok Where water charges are concerned, the present directive will constitute Europe' s water policy for the next three decades. endTok	61.78317020022787
startTok It is our duty to ensure from the very start that the present directive provides the right incentives and the proper driving force for a pricing system and an efficient structure of charges which will improve our environment in a cost-effective way. endTok	66.76293312153481
startTok It sounds good, saying that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge. endTok	59.44760911424446
startTok But water is not free of charge, any more than houses or food are free of charge. endTok	118.02268886039477
startTok It is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully husbanded as a resource. endTok	54.43261425569153
startTok I also want to add that, when it comes to groundwater and to water which has been heavily modified by human activities, I support a tighter timetable and a clarification of goals and of criteria for allowing exceptions to the rules. I also support expressly mentioning radioactive substances. endTok	88.85863344053439
startTok In the course of the debate, many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed. endTok	43.21921469829926
startTok I just want to emphasise this further. endTok	28.113002320839946
startTok It is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them. endTok	60.30228535381662
startTok This is also expressed in Recital 14. endTok	53.634525499404255
startTok Allow me also to say to Mr Bowe that, in common with my Scottish colleague, he need have no pangs of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of Scotch whisky now and again. endTok	72.2289852458294
startTok We have not considered it necessary for the Commission to regulate the very limited abstraction of water for whisky production. endTok	50.618246533251614
startTok Allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail. endTok	33.37712925379322
startTok Limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives. endTok	45.38247159273206
startTok I am glad to see that Parliament' s amendments have focused upon this. endTok	25.517923175773973
startTok The Commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the OSPAR Convention into the text. endTok	42.36940757400423
startTok We must, however, keep to their precise scope and content. endTok	63.2209071347689
startTok As I said, their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character. endTok	73.89694093889308
startTok It would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable. endTok	31.113738947919714
startTok It must nonetheless be guaranteed that the Member States and the Community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables. endTok	26.302821334234046
startTok I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88 . endTok	38.44148667374378
startTok The Commission cannot, on the other hand, approve Amendment No 19, in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in OSPAR. endTok	48.882877659847374
startTok The Commission' s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances, and so no definition is needed. endTok	39.29023141751794
startTok Even if I too agree with the contents of Amendments Nos 79 and 106, these go beyond the commitments under OSPAR, and I cannot therefore approve these Amendments. endTok	44.81684939572173
startTok The Commission can also, in principle, approve Amendment No 60, according to which a timetable is required for implementing the Commission' s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances. endTok	40.11773379070352
startTok Amendment No 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed. endTok	49.98946611089874
startTok This would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and cannot, therefore, be approved. endTok	48.25356022558315
startTok The desire expressed in Amendments Nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved. endTok	80.60796096589762
startTok Lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances. endTok	55.326197816797105
startTok I would point out in this regard that the OSPAR Convention does not in any way alter existing Community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector. endTok	26.28868384666444
startTok The Nitrates Directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive. endTok	30.141331787118794
startTok I appreciate the fact that Parliament has proved to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of imposing charges for water services. endTok	55.95007855996787
startTok I can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which creates incentives to use water resources in a sustainable way. endTok	40.611828332322915
startTok I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs. endTok	93.33897103980519
startTok I can therefore partly, and in principle, approve Amendments Nos 43-46, together with Amendment No 85. endTok	58.05519608406359
startTok I believe that we need legally binding requirements stating that the financial costs of water services are to be covered by each economic sector. endTok	33.89060400065904
startTok This would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured. endTok	61.28614855925184
startTok I therefore support the overall thrust of Amendment No 105, which is in line with the Commission' s original proposal. endTok	16.820537383343883
startTok I also support a gradual development in the direction of covering environmental costs and the costs of resources. endTok	58.28919914982257
startTok We are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals. endTok	39.755173082308275
startTok This must not, however, be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution. endTok	56.88096715204832
startTok We intend shortly to issue a communication from the Commission on precisely this question. endTok	62.902104938704156
startTok I agree with Parliament that the common position' s sixteen-year timeframe for implementing these measures must be considerably reduced. endTok	47.43549122141306
startTok The same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years. endTok	51.72186700003498
startTok Amendment No 28, cancelling the third extension period, is an important step in the right direction. endTok	29.552264498406032
startTok This proposal can therefore be approved. endTok	18.576293144924676
startTok A period of ten years, as proposed in Amendments Nos 24 and 26, among others, is, on the other hand, too short. endTok	68.05822691516943
startTok I believe that consideration ought to be given to wording the overall definition of the requirements under the proposal in such a way that it includes a strict and explicit condition to the effect that causing deterioration of the environment must be avoided. endTok	40.21139639435378
startTok The proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water. endTok	110.9920249168531
startTok This applies to Amendments Nos 6, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 78, 80, 102 and 104. endTok	34.07163673905566
startTok These Amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found. endTok	61.4892370450672
startTok To comply with the demands in Amendments Nos 27 and 29, to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension, would be going too far, and these cannot be approved. endTok	61.973483011122795
startTok Another important area is protection of the groundwater. endTok	99.08142832727381
startTok We need both a starting point and a final goal if we are to reverse the upward trend in pollution. endTok	49.04503989933095
startTok We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring. endTok	50.439793660804256
startTok The most important parts of Parliament' s Amendments Nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle. endTok	33.52773378733823
startTok The new definition in Amendment No 72 is, however, too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose. endTok	41.96057871771343
startTok I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution. endTok	25.56809198299297
startTok Amendment No 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater. endTok	42.67795938735155
startTok The proposal cannot therefore be approved. endTok	19.387013293965047
startTok The Commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality. endTok	80.63356398721325
startTok Instead, we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with Article 11 to promote activities in this area. endTok	42.524387056503436
startTok The good status which is required under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality is fulfilled. endTok	86.89381626860828
startTok This part of Amendment No 41 cannot, therefore, be approved. endTok	28.193495659401773
startTok The Commission appreciates Parliament' s efforts to guarantee that the so-called combined approach is given a central role. endTok	46.14398448245434
startTok This approach and its scope, which the Commission can in principle approve, are defined by Amendments Nos 22 and 47. endTok	86.5740781730423
startTok In order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality, we wish, however, to reformulate Amendment No 47 and to add a de minimis provision. endTok	77.94086167972536
startTok The transfer of water is already covered by controls, but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer. endTok	146.0195923056691
startTok These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 can, therefore, be approved. endTok	20.873616725105876
startTok It is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted. endTok	45.242913539747434
startTok The proposal already specifies that water must be abstracted in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned. endTok	60.896353609991564
startTok These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 cannot, therefore, be approved. endTok	22.191472207710433
startTok The Commission approves Amendment No 76 to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal. endTok	32.1494034757639
startTok To summarise, the Commission is able to approve 72 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle. endTok	44.83294415037351
startTok The following amendments cannot be approved: 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 71, 72, 74, 77, 79, 81, 83, 87, 89, 90, 91, 95, 97, 98, 100, 101, 103, 106 and 107. endTok	33.19591621275353
startTok Finally, I want to say that I welcome the efforts which Parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the Council takes other views. endTok	34.309084241142514
startTok Important progress has been made, and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions. endTok	179.36547219941355
startTok A number of obstacles remain, but I am convinced that, as the legislative work progresses, we shall achieve our common goal of creating a water policy we can be proud of. endTok	67.96612364927236
startTok Parliament' s adopting a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious, European water policy for the next three decades. endTok	45.90705963095778
startTok I would like to hear the Commissioner's view on Amendment No 45. endTok	15.844140379697343
startTok I may have missed it in the list she gave out. endTok	93.65207110639612
startTok . I accept that. endTok	50.681862439957214
startTok Thank you, Mrs Wallström. endTok	17.60385318935741
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m. endTok	3.4655258110367337
startTok Financial instrument for the environment (LIFE) endTok	166.09022838042424
startTok The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0014/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Regulation on a financial instrument for the environment (LIFE) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann). endTok	17.36262746214708
startTok rapporteur. endTok	2208.8109490460897
startTok (FR) Mr President, we have already had the opportunity, at the first reading, to examine this report and I was given to believe in committee that there was a broad consensus within this House. endTok	38.59016663948049
startTok LIFE is the only budget line for direct assistance for the environment in the Community budget, and one cannot help but note that it does not live up to our ambitions since the amounts allocated to it have been stagnating for years. Despite the enlargement which has already taken place, when we renewed the first LIFE programme to move on to the second, despite enlargement, the level of appropriations remained the same. endTok	76.37622257297151
startTok And then we see that, increasingly, the regions, the various operators, businesses, associations, are submitting LIFE projects, both for LIFE-NATURE and LIFE-ENVIRONMENT, projects that are of excellent quality, which following technical assessment by all the competent committees are unanimously found to be worthy of European Union support, but we still cannot fund them, for lack of budget appropriations. endTok	229.59436144731214
startTok It must also be mentioned that this budget experiences a rate of consumption of appropriations which is quite exceptional within the Community budget. endTok	97.38952535042824
startTok Patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement. endTok	60.01479653567718
startTok I would stress the LIFE-NATURE strand in particular. endTok	152.13261641619957
startTok We are well aware that, in the European Union, a whole raft of directives such as the directive on habitats and the directive on migratory birds encounter problems in implementation. With LIFE-NATURE we should be able to support policies which demonstrate the feasibility, the validity of the objectives of these directives, and their capacity to be implemented. endTok	48.75096289217024
startTok And, for want of appropriations, we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these European directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop. endTok	161.6025218438058
startTok And so the debates taking place today focus on two major issues: firstly, comitology, an ongoing debate within this House, but Parliament wished to implement policies settled rather by management committees or advisory committees which give the Commission some flexibility and which do not give the Council too much scope to obstruct and have their intergovernmental philosophy prevail over the Community philosophy which we are here to stand up for within the European Parliament. endTok	145.26587628148357
startTok But we have these comitology debates with regard to most of the European Union' s financial programmes and instruments. endTok	56.339608836727706
startTok I would say that in my opinion - and the experiences we have had in the past tend to show this - that reconciling opinions on comitology is rather easier than reconciling opinions on the budget. endTok	47.19959801748626
startTok Let me point out that Parliament is asking for 850 million ecus in appropriations, not a vast sum in the Community budget, and that the current proposals are for 613 million ecus. endTok	46.43456728989833
startTok I feel, at any rate, that for the ultimate application of LIFE, at least, there would be some way for the Union to make a significant budgetary gesture in favour of the environment. endTok	53.99467349293712
startTok Let me conclude with the matter of our institutions' way of working. endTok	125.68680818857976
startTok This is the essence of how I understand the situation: we are being told that it is essential for us to reach a conclusion quickly, that, basically, the Members of Parliament should drop their claims, particularly claims on the budget, for if we do not soon, in line with the codecision procedure, get around to establishing the framework of the regulations for LIFE, then its implementation for the year 2000 is going to suffer a delay, and in the meantime the NGOs and the operators at grass roots level are waiting for our appropriations. endTok	60.04147377273149
startTok I would, however, like to point out that the Council has plenty of time to formulate its ideas and that it is submitting its proposals to us only a few months before the fateful date. endTok	34.678790420770135
startTok As for us, we our bound by the terms of the texts: a maximum of four months. endTok	127.26427028629361
startTok We meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others, because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time. endTok	57.64264383224769
startTok I think Parliament often protests about this method, not to point the finger at any specific party within the Council, and I certainly would not want the Portuguese Presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs, since, the truth is, it is something of a tradition, which the Council has kept going for a long time. endTok	71.4647370341818
startTok But I should like to stress the fact that, on this issue of the environment, the budget issue is a central one and Parliament cannot yield to the blackmail which requires it to be the only reasonable party in the deal. endTok	39.91993487922174
startTok I therefore hope, firstly, that our fellow Members will support us in the conciliation - but votes on this area are always very much in agreement - but also that the Council and the Commission will manage to listen to us and that we shall each take a step towards the other. endTok	66.36181164041717
startTok Mr President, it is true that we are in open disagreement on some of the choices made by the Council and the Commission, and I will refer to this later on. endTok	25.396721586573474
startTok It is equally true, however, that we should begin by saying that this regulation is better than those covering LIFE I and LIFE II. endTok	52.32740586324566
startTok It is better firstly because the framework proposal made LIFE I more rigorous, more transparent and more rational. endTok	180.51693987781474
startTok Secondly, it is better because the common position includes some fundamental recommendations, which were advocated by the European Parliament at first reading. Specifically, these are: to promote employment as a factor to be taken into consideration when selecting candidate projects, and to reduce the environmental impact of products at every stage from production to recycling and elimination. endTok	68.78378255697274
startTok This is one of the aims that LIFE-Environment must achieve. Thirdly, the fact that the common position has for the first time introduced upgrading and planning for coastal areas as one of LIFE-Environment' s priorities is an extremely positive step. endTok	68.48671244999268
startTok In spite of all its virtues though, LIFE III' s regulation fails in what is obviously the most important aspect of determining a financial instrument' s impact, which is its budget. endTok	102.76485612052794
startTok By persisting with their proposal of EUR 613 million as a reference amount for 2000 - 2004, and by refusing to accept the European Parliament' s proposal of EUR 850 million, the Commission and the Council are taking a decision which we do not feel is based on the same criteria of rationality and justice that they introduced, and rightly so, for other measures in LIFE III. endTok	73.73977596183101
startTok We want the Commission and the Council to know that we will not give up trying to provide LIFE with the budget it deserves and which best guarantees the environmental results that we are seeking to achieve with this kind of instrument. endTok	50.60776024046362
startTok We have four very straightforward arguments which we feel justify our choice. endTok	97.62590735189907
startTok Firstly, LIFE is the only direct financial instrument which is designed to promote environmental policy within the European Union. endTok	37.858971481516434
startTok There is no other such policy. endTok	53.395792094375594
startTok Secondly, LIFE is an instrument that has already produced good results, and has enabled innovative methods and techniques to be developed and has an excellent rate of implementation. endTok	78.27427475085211
startTok Thirdly, the LIFE budget has been reduced in real terms has not kept up with the enormous dynamism and creativity of demand. endTok	66.74596719739414
startTok Fourthly, as Parliament ascribes so much value to LIFE, it has allocated ever-greater appropriations to this project in its annual budget. endTok	219.57022969628642
startTok This means that approving the proposal put forward by the Council and by the Commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of this trend. endTok	29.99002539533028
startTok Our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue, however. endTok	236.8887943510276
startTok Climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the European public and which have deserved considerable attention from this House. endTok	62.169154640521114
startTok We therefore feel it is crucial that as Amendments Nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objectives which LIFE-Environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water, as well as for reducing greenhouse gases, they should be adopted. endTok	79.30120670528298
startTok Lastly, I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her report and to take the opportunity to say to her that we will be voting in favour of her amendments on comitology even though, as was made clear in the Committee on the Environment, we would prefer LIFE to have been monitored by an advisory committee, we do want to contribute to allowing the solution proposed by the Council to be accepted as quite frankly, it was worse. endTok	40.39628639094727
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE is the European Union' s most important instrument and indeed its only financial instrument dedicated exclusively to the environment. endTok	25.16864693176921
startTok That explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions, ambitions for which, of course, there is a price. endTok	51.015177383383026
startTok Obviously, the basic item for discussion with the Council will be the allocation for LIFE III. endTok	117.42983511144783
startTok The common position stipulates a total appropriation of EUR 613 million for the period 2000-2004. This is not enough. endTok	18.012605104894018
startTok The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of increasing this amount to EUR 850 million. endTok	14.50374664427414
startTok We therefore support Mrs Lienemann' s amendment which observes that the allocation for LIFE was not increased when the Union was last enlarged, without even mentioning the next batch of new arrivals. endTok	75.99401757915184
startTok The amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure. endTok	89.56440038422406
startTok Quite the opposite, it is still fairly modest in relation to the requirements to be funded. endTok	47.989336608808
startTok A drop in the ocean, I might say, in comparison with Europe' s structural policies. endTok	50.521117371281896
startTok The environment is still the poor relation in the European budget, even though it is primarily an investment. endTok	67.11906322324927
startTok An investment in natural resources, of course, but also in employment, since it has been demonstrated that an active environmental policy generated new jobs, as shown particularly by the great success of LIFE, a success with NGOs, businesses, local authorities and third countries. endTok	156.55146110540397
startTok More than one third of the 8,500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately 1,300 projects between 1992 and 1998. endTok	95.68516680592144
startTok A success which Parliament wishes and intends to see perpetuated, and this is why we also support amendment 14 outlining the fourth phase of the LIFE project. endTok	84.49857551083433
startTok In matters of the environment, investment and ambition come in a variety of forms, and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term. endTok	57.16756272896916
startTok This is the price of the future of generations to come. endTok	31.68210892469205
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, I am probably going to repeat things my fellow Members have said but I believe that, as far as the Council is concerned, the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of LIFE. endTok	36.88278578018288
startTok I shall therefore reiterate that, as the rapporteur has already said quite clearly, LIFE is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the European Union' s policy on the environment. endTok	22.353916554498376
startTok This instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe, which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States. endTok	51.579659225958025
startTok This financial instrument is, furthermore, deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non-governmental organisations. endTok	85.961078237343
startTok That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendments which have no appreciation of the spirit of LIFE. endTok	18.880774969734876
startTok Through the associations, then, LIFE is a facility that can be used by the European citizen directly, and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community. endTok	71.6776260862835
startTok Several million NGO members - millions, I say - recognise in LIFE the Union' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage. endTok	158.25747408115242
startTok LIFE is, moreover, the fundamental instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe into which the Member States have put a lot, pursuant to Community directives on the habitats of rare and endangered fauna and flora and on migratory birds, and which makes it possible to set up the protection of sites of high biological value in our States. endTok	52.18879620758465
startTok I should like to say that those who run down this policy in their own States bear the responsibility for obstructing European nature conservation policies. endTok	51.020444219563096
startTok This is a pity because everyone within this Chamber knows that LIFE is a financial instrument which is not sufficient to carry out the projects submitted by Member States, a good many of which are turned down due to lack of funds. endTok	47.37277628710328
startTok Let us not forget that, to date, LIFE amounts to only EUR 100 million per annum, i.e. scarcely 0.1% of the budget of the European Union. endTok	32.82604132347841
startTok For the record, the budget for agriculture, which has a real impact on the environment, amounts, as we all know, to EUR 37 billion. endTok	63.642239765600785
startTok Against this background, my group thinks it essential to increase the allocation to LIFE and unreservedly supports Mrs Lienemann' s proposal to increase the budget to EUR 850 million, since we know, and I think it bears saying, how high the expectations of our fellow citizens on environmental matters are and how excessively cautious and unacceptable the Council' s compromise regarding the budget for LIFE is, especially as the LIFE programmes show exceptional implementation rates and have demonstrated the extent to which they made it possible to bring about new environmental practice. endTok	99.2049109959977
startTok The first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those. endTok	122.32694882973391
startTok Mr President, the European Union environmental programme, to which a considerable amount (EUR 613 million) has been allocated, gives rise to many questions regarding the proper use of public funds. endTok	55.8707912190906
startTok A financial instrument of this order ought to be transparent and effective, and this is not the case for the following reasons: poorly defined selection criteria, dubious uncoordinated operations, assessments not made public and the lack of any assessment policy. endTok	74.75118876510479
startTok We are therefore proposing to amend the regulations as follows. endTok	39.44323789976593
startTok Firstly, to reserve the acquisitions made thanks to LIFE funds exclusively to public bodies, subsequently, following invitation to tender, to entrust the management of these sites to authorised nature conservation associations. endTok	210.5563640149505
startTok It is a question of the continuity of the ownership of the acquisitions, since private law associations may disappear or resell acquisitions. endTok	78.511304923986
startTok It is shocking in philosophical terms and dubious in legal terms for 100% public money to be used to build up a heritage of private land ownership, even under cover of environmental protection. endTok	131.34508826564817
startTok Secondly, to define the criteria for the eligibility and allocation of LIFE funds, in order to rule our any suspicions of clientelism or ostracism. endTok	57.558899439003255
startTok Thirdly, to make prior coordination with the users and communities concerned a prerequisite. endTok	182.2402880530349
startTok For example, the LIFE-Nature project in France, at Grand-Lieu Lake, planned without any coordination, led to a real ecological disaster, the de-silting operation which was carried out without regard for French law on the subject caused significant silting of the Acheneau, a water course located downstream, destroying spawning beds, filling wetlands, and who knows what else. endTok	120.6389085428857
startTok The silt was in fact shifted 3 kilometres, at a cost of FF 6 million, the cure being worse than the disease, and a consequence that was foreseeable and actually predicted by the parties involved with the site. endTok	49.04056158953937
startTok Result: a court action and repair costs greater than the cost of the programme itself. endTok	237.97691919485237
startTok This is the sort of thing that we want to avoid. endTok	21.44728897845167
startTok Four, to include representatives of Parliament in the monitoring committee, at least one Member per political group. endTok	146.70843610607017
startTok What could be fairer than for Members of Parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for? endTok	70.72712175591627
startTok Fifthly, to publish an annual scientific, technical and financial assessment of LIFE operations carried out. endTok	111.81337728503809
startTok Six, to carry out proper evaluation of the programmes on a regular basis. endTok	96.73508742086362
startTok Seven, to make it possible for these funds to be used in the event of an environmental emergency: for example, in reforestation following storm damage, or restoration of the natural environment following an oil slick, etc. endTok	61.58278141364173
startTok Here, Mrs Lienemann, Mr President, we are putting forward here a practical proposal, a common sense proposal, easy to implement, likely to limit local conflicts and to vindicate the proper use of public monies, before increasing the LIFE budget line by as much as 40%! endTok	115.64520251912978
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the report she has carried out, and also the Commission - why not? - because this report, this position, generally improves on the texts in force. endTok	33.93572933140222
startTok Furthermore, it contains more acceptable systematics and is clearer and more transparent. endTok	74.14860694585134
startTok I would also like to congratulate the services of the Commission, since the evaluation, control and monitoring of the LIFE programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of projects. endTok	54.96429686010178
startTok However, I would like to insist on certain points. endTok	13.801135240511224
startTok Firstly, its continuity, which, in principle, I am not questioning. endTok	98.05484286443746
startTok Secondly, the financial contributions. endTok	153.047359641494
startTok Sadly, only 7.2% of the projects requested receive funds. endTok	188.38598423131467
startTok Of the EUR 1 919 million requested, only EUR 784 million have been granted. endTok	74.38889139999789
startTok Now the financial statement shows only EUR 613 million to cover more countries and competences. endTok	134.85068495634107
startTok Parliament has proposed EUR 850 million, but the document repeats the initial proposal of EUR 613 million. endTok	44.60512226743729
startTok Commissioner, our environmental commitments are increasing in all areas, while the only financial instrument exclusively dedicated to the environment is decreasing. endTok	79.06190487183977
startTok Is this not a contradiction? endTok	95.89317448094599
startTok Let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves? endTok	26.666635353682825
startTok Why do we all go on about the environment and are then not prepared to pay for it amongst all of us, but rather expect the usual people, the ones who live there all year, to pay for it and maintain it? endTok	99.19095712403254
startTok Commissioner, we must be consistent. endTok	55.85518161624457
startTok The cost of maintaining the environment, which we all enjoy, must be met by all of us, and the LIFE programme is the only financial instrument aimed exclusively at the environment and whose projects have generally been effective. endTok	67.97215194842393
startTok Mr President, LIFE has been the principal instrument available to the Community since 1992 for supporting and developing environmental policy, both within the Community and in the surrounding third countries. endTok	69.16922603001332
startTok On the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years, an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument. endTok	45.28130908341556
startTok The funding of activities for the implementation, adaptation and development of Community policy in the environment sector and the incorporation of the environment in other policies, particularly ones that contribute towards sustainable development, are central elements of the regulation we are to vote upon. endTok	63.65292280076423
startTok An important element of LIFE-Nature, which mainly concerns the realisation of the Natura 2000 network, is the introduction of a multinational approach to formulating plans for international projects and activities, so as to avoid the fragmentation of biotopes and to offer better protection of biodiversity. endTok	62.92088402350714
startTok In the second, LIFE-Environment strand, which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium-sized enterprises and local government agencies, the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed. endTok	76.84289551341641
startTok As regards the financing package for the implementation of LIFE over the next five years, I wholeheartedly support the increase from EUR 613 million to EUR 850 million proposed by the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann. endTok	38.29353474911741
startTok Unless the necessary means are secured to pursue environmental protection, there is no point on the one hand in continuing to raise the environmental awareness achieved in recent years, and on the other hand in incorporating the environmental dimension in other policies. endTok	56.098798283453185
startTok Besides, we cannot remain indifferent towards the increased challenges in areas around the Union or towards addressing very acute environmental protection problems in the applicant countries. endTok	141.5682813048839
startTok What has happened over the past few days with the pollution of the Danube and its tributary has been instructive. endTok	24.84690084601862
startTok Consequently, I consider that support for environmental action under the LIFE financial instrument will help to further Community policy in the environmental sector and can contribute substantially to fulfilling the Community' s mission of achieving a high level of environmental protection and improvement. endTok	59.94309586723725
startTok Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment, ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening. endTok	28.653364263853895
startTok Two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic. endTok	55.373124168034266
startTok So I will simply appeal to the Commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue. endTok	42.579048956330055
startTok For five years, I have been the representative of the Committee on the Environment in a regional organisation, which assuredly does not have Parliament' s broad perspective. endTok	31.9602986958338
startTok The environment is in a parlous state. endTok	40.805057738366095
startTok Like a number of previous speakers, I, too, wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects, which, in my view, should be incorporated into the pubic domain. endTok	39.43385382350817
startTok As regards funding, EUR 613 million is not enough. Even EUR 850 million is not enough. endTok	43.92322770220756
startTok At the end of August 1999, I took part in a meeting of the Committee of the Environment in which it was said that EUR 2 million, or ITL 4 000 billion, should go towards eliminating or, at any rate, reducing smoking. endTok	41.54329218698396
startTok However, the environment constitutes a far bigger and more serious problem than smoking. endTok	56.993204050306474
startTok EUR 850 million - assuming that such a figure is actually agreed - believe me, is not enough, in practical terms, to allow any type of project to be carried out. endTok	93.88869324878915
startTok In many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established. endTok	48.606423059838356
startTok But creating parks with very limited financial resources, without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual. endTok	104.14333439265636
startTok I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention. endTok	42.383552250052034
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ever since the beginning of 1999, discussions have taken place between the institutions on the subject of the proposed regulation for a third stage for the instrument for the environment known as LIFE. endTok	47.99807874875905
startTok I would again thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and Mrs Lienemann for the good and constructive co-operation we have had on this matter. endTok	26.85980194363809
startTok As a result of this, I can confirm that the Commission wholly or in principle approves nine of the fourteen amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. endTok	19.968449433145537
startTok The Commission welcomes, above all, Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13, which apply to the Committee procedures. endTok	35.296788775904396
startTok In these cases, Parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the Commission had to the common position. endTok	42.49171275675042
startTok The Commission can, in principle, also approve Amendment No 4 which ought, however, to be introduced into another place in the text. endTok	48.82287009373691
startTok With regard to Amendments Nos 5 and 6, I want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water, together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect, are to a large degree covered by LIFE. endTok	50.92121995909437
startTok The Commission nonetheless considers that, if this is stated separately, then that is to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority areas. endTok	67.25631219425989
startTok There is also a risk of overlap with other Community programmes such as the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, Technical Development and Demonstration. endTok	37.9734621147365
startTok The present programme' s key measures - water quality, tomorrow' s city and innovative products and processes - to a certain degree cover the same questions. endTok	271.6000391155165
startTok Where the question of the budget is concerned, I am pleased about the confidence shown by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. endTok	17.062198886466945
startTok Amendment No 12 requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position. endTok	85.02582357285324
startTok I am also convinced that LIFE has great potential. endTok	28.909625571311373
startTok This instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget. endTok	112.0232689074503
startTok The amount quoted in Amendment No 12 does not, however, tally with the budget set on the basis of Agenda 2000. endTok	41.85770198479674
startTok Allow me also to add that, if the budget is increased, greater demands are obviously going to be made upon the Directorate-General for the Environment if an increased number of projects are going to be dealt with. endTok	48.16355218277837
startTok Account will also have to be taken of other programmes where decisions are to be made within the framework of the joint decision-making procedure. endTok	35.85321358379351
startTok At this stage, the Commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position. endTok	20.446803396875566
startTok With regard to Amendment No 3, which we did not approve at first reading, I want to emphasise that each programme has its own objectives, conditions under which it may be applied for and costs which make it eligible for aid. endTok	56.70659025719616
startTok It is therefore meaningless, and often impossible, directly to transfer projects from LIFE to other instruments. endTok	102.49613752687891
startTok If other sources of finance were to be investigated for each project, more resources would, moreover, be required than are available in the present situation. endTok	101.01328248780496
startTok Now that the Commission has to consider carefully what resources are required for each activity, this is an example of the kind of activity we ought to avoid: one that is inessential but demanding in terms of resources. endTok	48.15521618404536
startTok Nor can the Commission approve Amendment No 14, which is contrary to the Commission' s right of initiative. endTok	28.52183290507317
startTok With regard to the discussion concerning the deadline, I want to say that the final date for beginning to implement LIFE - 31 March 2000, as set in the common position - must now be moved forward. endTok	53.37551618065576
startTok The date will be fixed as soon as the present regulation has been adopted. endTok	25.269714627952826
startTok Finally, I want to repeat that I am convinced that LIFE will be an effective instrument in support of development and the implementation of the Community' s environmental policy. endTok	25.208727303232997
startTok Parliament has contributed greatly to improving this instrument. endTok	96.35992879924677
startTok I am convinced that you share my wish that it should be possible to adopt the regulation as soon as possible, especially in view of the fact that there are great expectations in the Member States and in other countries, especially among the applicant States which are now being given the opportunity to participate in LIFE. endTok	24.12142529534261
startTok Thank you, Mrs Wallström. endTok	17.60385318935741
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. endTok	4.628394244073071
startTok Modernising social protection endTok	142.7396550651014
startTok The next item is the report (A5-0033/2000), by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection [COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)]. endTok	5.155860846947965
startTok Mr President, the issue of social security systems is an important one. endTok	13.876394795392116
startTok This is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU. endTok	24.740533386357644
startTok The basis is monetary cooperation, which has since been followed up by macro-economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy. endTok	58.82409690923772
startTok It is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems. endTok	42.79536963597179
startTok These areas are mutually dependent upon one another. endTok	47.55553489633552
startTok Economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment. endTok	76.19227345755878
startTok It also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision. endTok	53.17702143883033
startTok But the reverse is also the case: a well-developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth. endTok	50.22652357912443
startTok In other words, social security is a factor of production. endTok	31.95622229380344
startTok Social security systems differ from one EU country to another. endTok	110.64041925205173
startTok This is largely due to historical factors. endTok	40.79119671857798
startTok We are now faced with a number of common challenges, however; demographic development, for example, which has to do not only with the increase in the number of elderly people but also with the lower birth rate. endTok	40.43897525849445
startTok The labour market is also changing. endTok	28.83727511594905
startTok Women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers. endTok	55.11449592534599
startTok Another challenge is presented by technical development. endTok	111.57392184446692
startTok We must meet these challenges together. endTok	43.60450850431265
startTok The Commission' s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared, a high-level group formed and benchmarking introduced. endTok	47.910534778433615
startTok What is more, the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment. endTok	33.167768279834846
startTok This is good, but it is not enough. endTok	19.81910583891318
startTok We propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process. endTok	81.19025866791934
startTok Clear guidelines and indicators are required. At the same time, the Member States are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans. endTok	61.840084646162786
startTok We are creating a common model, but retaining the principle of subsidiarity. endTok	31.914421582074443
startTok This social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period. endTok	35.2764125360291
startTok Parliament must therefore be involved in the work - not by being part of the high-level group, but by enabling parliamentary representatives to track the work of the latter and come up with proposals as to how the process is to be carried on. endTok	53.56901697995131
startTok Like the work on employment, the Commission' s proposal is founded upon four pillars. endTok	49.18631032132001
startTok These are: to make the systems employment-friendly; to make the pensions systems sustainable in the long term; to promote social integration; and to guarantee sustainable, high-quality health and medical care. endTok	92.67126595704939
startTok All this is important. endTok	43.12777878230581
startTok In our report, we have highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the EU and of finding indicators as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area. endTok	31.081850080902388
startTok Equality has no pillar of its own. endTok	82.221605329054
startTok There, it is mainstreaming which applies. endTok	182.154625836258
startTok All four pillars should reflect aspects of equality. endTok	204.45517118109052
startTok This is something we have borne in mind. endTok	29.97691483316946
startTok We are submitting a wide range of proposals to the effect, for example, that there should be a transition to individualised social security systems; that parental leave should involve entitlement to benefits under the social security systems; that there should be better opportunities to combine family and working life; and that the basic old-age pension should guarantee a decent standard of living. endTok	63.37012516327033
startTok These proposals favour women especially. endTok	501.848577232863
startTok Parallel to this European strategy of social convergence, a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is required, together with proposals for framework agreements in the context of the dialogue between employers and employees, accompanied by a concrete timetable. endTok	69.59630967591325
startTok We expect the Commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme. endTok	26.926465630583664
startTok Social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the Union, partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping. endTok	39.94111727764613
startTok The Commission ought to consider devising a special action programme concerning social policy in connection with enlargement. endTok	45.79390662393244
startTok We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee. endTok	22.99992360306186
startTok We had a lot of amendments, but succeeded in agreeing upon a report. endTok	54.34902395061789
startTok Now, the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen. endTok	66.8600687752734
startTok This indicates that we have a broad consensus. endTok	26.026468177303816
startTok A number of these amendments have come back from the Committee reading, and these I shall reject. endTok	61.22408004597488
startTok I shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members, because I do not think that these add anything to the report. endTok	34.540098812663196
startTok On the other hand, my group will applaud Amendment No 14 from the group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. endTok	12.10223135244551
startTok I think this proposal is a good one. endTok	16.496571330924812
startTok Certainly, it resembles Amendment No 1, but Amendment No 14 is better. endTok	59.449905251735316
startTok Finally, I want to say that the EU is not only concerned with cooperation on trade. endTok	28.1433079736525
startTok The EU is also a union for employment and social justice. endTok	28.636283789294165
startTok In creating a citizens' Europe, social policy has an important role to play. endTok	73.3341083106189
startTok By means of this report, Parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of European society. endTok	43.10335456706544
startTok We hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy. endTok	35.038835872309804
startTok The Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind. endTok	19.89666139474538
startTok Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion. endTok	12.299764739745095
startTok In the capacity of coordinator of the European People' s Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am very pleased with the compromise which was reached and which Mr Andersson put so much effort into. endTok	29.212691974062473
startTok I am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous Parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report. endTok	38.209804900151525
startTok The goal of the Commission' s notification of June 1999, on which the Andersson report is based, is to reinforce cooperation between the Member States and the EU in terms of social protection. endTok	32.18949348484395
startTok Key sub-goals are: promoting employment and ensuring that work secures a fixed income; secondly, safeguarding old-age pensions and making these affordable; thirdly, promoting social integration and fourthly, guaranteeing affordable, first-rate health protection. endTok	262.96363754377523
startTok Gender-related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals. endTok	120.39191878409639
startTok I believe that congratulations are also in order for the Commission with regard to this notification, for these four points are, in fact, to a very large number of EU citizens extremely important - if not the most important points which merit further thought. endTok	56.5468212011013
startTok The Commission' s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about European social convergence. endTok	39.56326473795088
startTok Macro-economic policy, employment policy and social policy all affect each other and this is why they should be brought more closely together. endTok	58.80693311046177
startTok The Commission has recognised this interrelatedness. endTok	21.510148295059874
startTok It is our intention to bring about an integrated social strategy which is, of course, underpinned by a sound macro-economic strategy and a sound employment strategy. endTok	48.644877896261626
startTok These aspects are very much interconnected. endTok	28.154703669155726
startTok It is, therefore, surprising that this topic has, to date, not been incorporated in a strategy and this is why the Commission' s notification constitutes a break-through in a way. endTok	39.82155809345489
startTok It brings me great joy to witness that the Council now seems to accept this break-through and also wants to bring it to the fore in Lisbon. endTok	58.312217503221504
startTok We should, of course, not get overly excited about it. endTok	44.15348257359084
startTok It marks the beginning, rather than the end, of a process. endTok	54.46917186074167
startTok Some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue. endTok	68.4545854905016
startTok But it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion. endTok	37.4226563644458
startTok The issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the European Union are quite different from one another. endTok	50.378319267946736
startTok The challenges are different. endTok	60.04304844369514
startTok The levels of employment are different and this is why it is very important to set the ball rolling gently but to make steady progress nonetheless. endTok	41.020257440307034
startTok In this way, we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges. endTok	21.44012114459501
startTok The majority within my group is of the opinion that something like this needs to happen. endTok	48.89867217532293
startTok The funny thing about the Andersson report is that it does not get bogged down with too many details of how everything should take shape; from this perspective it is not a pie-in-the-sky report. endTok	48.69861716740692
startTok It is a report which tries to give direction. endTok	38.48614694796911
startTok There are, however, one or two aspects about which I have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific. endTok	49.32449485494207
startTok I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this. endTok	21.16240094132262
startTok But that does not take away from the fact that the report' s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in Lisbon. endTok	35.58171710970818
startTok I believe that if it were to be adopted in Lisbon in this way, Lisbon will turn out to be a success. endTok	36.0950727915782
startTok If it is not adopted, Lisbon will not add much to what has already been said in the past. endTok	40.429306087422994
startTok As far as this is concerned, the report, albeit a component, may well be the key component of Lisbon, because it is really innovative, while many other things are merely a rumination of what has been said before. endTok	45.06910693696469
startTok All in all, I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee for this report. endTok	22.745487185648003
startTok I hope that Europe, in terms of social protection, will make a step forward, taking into account subsidiarity, for without subsidiarity, this would not be possible. endTok	64.8905081012072
startTok Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like my fellow MEP, Bartho Pronk, please allow me to thank the Commission for this communication and, in particular, to congratulate our rapporteur for the work he has put into this report. endTok	26.512258277071247
startTok Commissioner, the fact that this report is no longer controversial within Parliament does not mean that it has lost any of its crucial importance. endTok	48.66103637420372
startTok There have been times within this Parliament when such discussions on social security were actually quite awkward. endTok	84.7051632822023
startTok It is also a timely discussion - as Mr Pronk said just a moment ago - at a time when preparations are in full swing for the Lisbon Summit, which intends to find out how we can put economic growth, employment and social cohesion on the agenda in Europe via the Information Society. endTok	41.12206614337066
startTok Within my group, it speaks for itself that social protection forms an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be added to the agenda in Lisbon. endTok	77.16855754013928
startTok My group is pleased that the Social Affairs Council gave the go-ahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that, in fact, a group of high-ranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the Council an initial report by June 2000. endTok	53.8708711876966
startTok However, we, the Parliament and, in particular, the group of the Social Democrats, want Lisbon to go one step further now. endTok	110.17208289075931
startTok It is of great importance that, in our fellow MEP' s report, this European Parliament advocates a true European strategy of social convergence, based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so-called Luxembourg strategy, that is to say it should encompass common goals, guidelines, national action plans and performance evaluations. endTok	80.17276620230633
startTok We believe that this course of action is ambitious, yet achievable. endTok	84.03107542998642
startTok Needless to say, it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level. endTok	23.29516460756247
startTok The financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this, and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the European agenda, and why, in fact, scenarios such as Danny Peters' thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have scarcely got off the ground. endTok	72.62885129549277
startTok But this new course of action is very exciting. endTok	46.2062624274453
startTok The employment strategy has proved that it can function well and social convergence is also necessary, for our social security systems are facing the same challenges, and in an EMU era, social security systems would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition. endTok	91.76411397069079
startTok But let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group: social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation. endTok	52.45237549055014
startTok They can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the Commission in terms of social legislation. endTok	50.60283762113333
startTok I think that it also a good thing if, moreover, the European Parliament tried to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001. endTok	54.94747324506185
startTok I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group' s idea and we hope, Commissioner, that we can also count on your support. endTok	27.712727512952906
startTok Finally, we urge the European Parliament, both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process. endTok	54.58418434966566
startTok The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support. endTok	36.586488047909285
startTok Mr President, the four chief objectives which the EU countries' governments endorsed in November of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows: that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable; that social integration should be promoted; and that sustainable, high-quality health care should be guaranteed. endTok	100.43338642828905
startTok These are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them. Having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from. endTok	55.85193238397524
startTok The Commission' s communication, which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the Council in November, is a well-balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the Member States in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the Union. endTok	30.837734027812157
startTok We now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets, which is a problem for many Member States. endTok	77.91217550358104
startTok If reforms are not got under way, we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy, and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security. endTok	56.233914446329365
startTok It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda. endTok	41.43080857875288
startTok In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU, we often use the expression social convergence. endTok	75.47968191412149
startTok As liberals, we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies. endTok	59.06536739146476
startTok It is not, therefore, about harmonisation but about common objectives. endTok	90.28507153637628
startTok It is, of course, a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy. endTok	35.28952702397602
startTok We have different traditions and there are differences in culture and, in spite of there being many points of similarity, there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned. It is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern. endTok	58.022179806344376
startTok National policy is, of course, subject to a number of common parameters. That is the case with minimum social entitlements, which are established by treaty. endTok	70.87529718380205
startTok It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements. It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation. endTok	56.328111867434586
startTok So coordination and cooperation are facts of life. But convergence should be about goals, not means. endTok	362.1817329345684
startTok I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Jan Andersson, for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report. endTok	28.950879569901893
startTok I can support the report, but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste. endTok	35.13647850154958
startTok I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems, if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient, or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries. endTok	48.791288594465975
startTok I am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the Commission' s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly, and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold. endTok	47.88022835847898
startTok Dialogue and the coordination of social policy are to be commended, but we should not lump all nations together as if they were the same. There should be room for a multiplicity of solutions. endTok	39.01473814953928
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the strategy which has been set out here on modernising social security, I would like to point out some positive things as well as raise some questions that have come up for me. endTok	39.42287409271006
startTok I feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier. endTok	76.95183470023848
startTok This seems to be a good thing and useful. endTok	26.159330470265438
startTok I also feel positive about the essence of the communication, namely the strategic approach. endTok	68.38688748071253
startTok We therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved. endTok	38.631849509291825
startTok We would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled. On the one hand, it would be useful to have guidelines and a process styled on Luxembourg, but we also think it is important, as is already mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker, that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios, such as sole traders, etc. endTok	58.89903680977241
startTok We nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found. endTok	69.58210747160655
startTok The first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security, which, we hope, will be replaced by high-level convergence. endTok	41.75955755376063
startTok I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union. endTok	73.89133849891273
startTok It appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments, in fact, the majority of them, appear to be downward adjustments, the remainder being improvements. endTok	101.31124794786143
startTok The lion' s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans: eleven restrictions and two improvements. endTok	98.03324388264912
startTok In the case of unemployment benefits, we came across six restrictions and five improvements. endTok	122.96920944179736
startTok The reasons for adjustments are, for example, to improve employment, reduce social security expenditure, but are also due to policy competition and EMU criteria. endTok	118.69588076221308
startTok Policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries. endTok	160.88992325374363
startTok The highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries. endTok	47.89945598078063
startTok All in all, both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole. endTok	48.50367074730225
startTok This is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches. endTok	81.50577415558575
startTok To use a figure of speech, cappuccino is not always good for us. endTok	73.13174599124416
startTok Mr President, I would, in turn, like to congratulate both the Commission, for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security, and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled. endTok	35.00526924468633
startTok The European Union' s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy. endTok	19.17386117891183
startTok So far, social policy has remained limited in terms of set-up and resources. endTok	57.066981544823676
startTok But under the influence of the free movement of employees, of the internal market and of the euro, the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated. endTok	46.89127978495551
startTok This has undeniable repercussions on social protection which is tied in with labour to a large extent. endTok	38.43287238431554
startTok Cross-border workers, employees on secondment and migrating employees, as well as job-seekers, students on placement and other students, experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement. This is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection. endTok	52.248132196012605
startTok In fact, the same phenomenon occurs in tax law. endTok	105.2946990831653
startTok In order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dumping, the Commission has, in my opinion, developed a well-balanced approach which steers a midcourse between harmonisation and non-intervention. endTok	66.8544897691423
startTok On the one hand, binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old-age pensions and on the other hand, programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non-discrimination or social exclusion. endTok	86.03312685391184
startTok Based on a number of recommendations, reports and communications, the Commission has made another step in the convergence process by setting out objectives and by setting up a working party of high-ranking officials. endTok	68.35523107365566
startTok Both proposals have already been accepted by the Council and it is thus a matter of endorsing this approach in order to be able to make an assessment in time, with knowledge of all facts and/or in order to establish to what extent and in what way social protection should be reorganised in the European Union. endTok	38.390534659771795
startTok Indeed, expansion, globalisation, a sharp increase in the ageing population, individualisation and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable. endTok	109.72032493226256
startTok Denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection. endTok	54.378925857332696
startTok With regard to eurosceptics and nationalists, I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection. endTok	40.135126389991065
startTok Indeed, if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition, this would also harm social protection as a production factor. endTok	53.7131620767914
startTok And less social protection means less purchasing power, fewer healthy employees and fewer happy employees. endTok	468.03446077324213
startTok In respect of the super-Europeans, I would say that European social protection is neither attainable nor desirable. endTok	58.427362109870025
startTok The discrepancies between the Member States are too immense in terms of provisions, rightful claimants, revenue or benefits, etc. It is thus impossible to bring all States into line. endTok	63.77462943410084
startTok The path which the Commission is walking is, in fact, obvious. endTok	33.39163138334414
startTok It has the advantage of clarity, and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and finely tune solid, comparative indicators and put forward recommendations. endTok	92.16224075561358
startTok I endorse this view. endTok	70.93957246016097
startTok I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter. endTok	22.223505003322835
startTok Mr President, Mr Andersson' s report contains a lot that is of interest. endTok	22.80239072818983
startTok Unfortunately, what is most interesting is that the report, which purports to be concerned with a combined strategy for modernising social policy, instead proposes an extension of traditional social policy and more supranationalism in the social sphere. endTok	42.53096751955639
startTok Social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the Member States. endTok	19.748405575245584
startTok Even though the socialists, now that there are so many social democratic governments, talk much less about unemployment than they used to, the unemployment in question is still high, and this in spite of the trade boom. endTok	116.6902970821046
startTok Something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the so-called European model into a parody. endTok	51.56483051376059
startTok Social policy must facilitate employment, creating incentives for employers and employees to, respectively, provide and accept jobs. endTok	202.6376658653096
startTok Mr Andersson' s report demands social convergence, that is to say that systems should be increasingly standardised within and throughout the EU. endTok	101.31719012512751
startTok The EU should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria, which would be binding and of real effect. endTok	119.72857414485657
startTok Mr Andersson also wants to see efficient and ambitious tax coordination, that is to say supranationalism in the fiscal sphere. endTok	57.788642464502956
startTok The EU should also, on the basis of a uniform definition of poverty thresholds, table recommendations concerning what is called the minimum acceptable subsistence level in the Member States. endTok	57.997312385698805
startTok The EU should devise guidelines governing the quality of the job opportunities which are to be created, whatever that may mean. endTok	90.4523513700221
startTok It is certainly not going to be possible to reduce unemployment with all these additional regulations and forms of interference. endTok	45.44731900525464
startTok Those structural problems which make unemployment higher in Europe than in the United States will become even greater. endTok	113.778263713782
startTok There is no need at all for supranationalism in this area. endTok	21.69556079420121
startTok The Member States can devise their own systems in the social sphere, each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences. endTok	40.34383030120511
startTok It is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the EU. endTok	45.754258274375374
startTok Mr Andersson thinks that the less wealthy Eastern countries should be reminded that social convergence is to apply to them too. endTok	57.3762060284182
startTok It is obvious, however, that these countries, impoverished within a Communist economic system, cannot cope with a social policy like, for example, Sweden' s. endTok	72.23060401277975
startTok Talk of minimum regulations and poverty thresholds is meaningless to the present Member States and unreasonable as far as less wealthy applicant States are concerned. endTok	55.64219850319964
startTok Mr President, as others have done, I should also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for the report he has produced. endTok	18.02881139488571
startTok He has done a great deal of work on behalf of Parliament in producing a wide-ranging consensus on what is, by any definition, a thorny issue, not just in this Parliament but in virtually every Member State. endTok	48.34944220434688
startTok I also welcome the Commission's communication. endTok	12.710646350313406
startTok It was slow in coming but well worth waiting for. endTok	83.0084138744302
startTok It could be a landmark in the development of a social Europe, providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to baulk at the steps that must be taken to implement it. endTok	41.64705435401819
startTok We can, and must, take the unique European social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty-first century, a century which is globalising fast. endTok	112.68475217669419
startTok I am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world. endTok	34.55447187957953
startTok To be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy, our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broadest sense, are integrated and that we deal with them as a whole. endTok	43.022532720852745
startTok We have to ensure that our ECOFIN ministers and our employment ministers acknowledge that social affairs ministers have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in Europe which is creative, has initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizens. endTok	59.84790407409019
startTok This is not an option for us any more. endTok	43.46431390135872
startTok It is an imperative. endTok	51.552673167670704
startTok European citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings. endTok	69.19650790096928
startTok We do not want the US model - a model which has spectacularly failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life. endTok	53.84119730330657
startTok What it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the United States. endTok	48.94089362686987
startTok That is not what we want to do in Europe. endTok	18.947668851381135
startTok We have the traditions of solidarity in Europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things. endTok	46.58113278754495
startTok But we have to grasp the tools to do that. endTok	33.931036928995496
startTok I therefore urge that we not only implement the high-level group as proposed by the Commission but also go further and have a Luxembourg-type process so that we have an integrated approach to this issue of social protection. endTok	45.09417197290407
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, this is one of the social areas to which the European Union ought to pay much more attention. endTok	23.213785471408354
startTok Macroeconomic policies, the stability pact and the criteria for nominal convergence have put a brake on modernising social protection which would improve the quality of people' s lives, specifically by means of a significant increase in pensions and pension schemes, particularly of the minimum pensions, and through fighting social exclusion. endTok	62.537925575449314
startTok This situation is particularly serious in countries such as Portugal where the minimum pensions and pension schemes are barely more than half of the minimum national wage which in turn, is the lowest in the whole of Europe. endTok	45.44127320666929
startTok Therefore, while the Commission does not accept the need to amend its macroeconomic policies to create more jobs of quality, with employee rights, which is a fundamental basis for maintaining and modernising a solid, public social protection system, we harbour serious doubts as to its position. endTok	90.45692337603764
startTok Although the Andersson report has gathered some positive proposals, including some that we put forward ourselves, we are still critical of some of the bases for the Commission' s proposal and we still have concerns about the strategy for modernising social protection. endTok	52.27989454942972
startTok Mr President, in my previous life I ran two manufacturing businesses, one in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands. endTok	49.84351212511467
startTok As the UK business grew, we invested in more people, as the Dutch business grew we invested in more machinery. endTok	111.97819415076376
startTok The simple reason for this was that social costs in the Netherlands were just too high in comparison. endTok	94.12371401453419
startTok I am in favour of social protection, I am in favour of the original Commission document, but I do not want to see people priced out of jobs because social protection costs become unrealistically high. endTok	37.89311524178092
startTok That is why in committee I proposed some form of business impact assessment, so that costs and risks to jobs could be taken into account, and the EPP-DE Group supported this amendment. endTok	88.07241974111858
startTok But I must record that other groups, led by the PSE Group, guided by my countryman, Stephen Hughes, voted this out. endTok	90.35858998262819
startTok I accept that Mr Andersson's report is very well-intentioned, and I respect him for the work he has done, but in my view the way the report defines and promotes social convergence would drive social costs higher throughout the EU. endTok	51.4553089748066
startTok This would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this House by showing how remote we are from the real world. endTok	82.02185693505356
startTok I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal, which was very well-balanced, stand unamended. endTok	67.20277609731006
startTok Mr President, we are unable to vote for this report. endTok	11.477465371535203
startTok The European Union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of Europe. endTok	37.22151127276453
startTok Social rights should determine economic choices, and not the other way around. endTok	188.56015414465074
startTok This is why, when it comes to social protection, we are opposed to schemes copied from the Luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale: broad economic guidelines, then convergence criteria and, finally, social issues, dealt with as the last resort. endTok	87.97953116384814
startTok The European Union should proclaim one general principle, to wit, that the social rights acquired in Member States may not be restricted. endTok	45.02995728681689
startTok Any Community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator. endTok	91.0230426112926
startTok In order to strengthen the funding of social security systems, we need a policy of general wage increase, the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each Member State. endTok	38.53055595488113
startTok In order to fight poverty, entitlement to an income and to employment are inalienable rights. endTok	126.58846972469846
startTok Finally, in order to avoid health being treated in any way as a commodity, the European Union should declare itself clearly opposed to pension funds and to a situation where private insurance companies have access to the health system. endTok	59.39909914614431
startTok I sincerely hope, in conclusion, that social Europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes. endTok	151.54398771889825
startTok For millions of people the situation is too tragic for that. endTok	58.735387150377356
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, the aim of developing a coordinated strategy for modernising social protection in the European Union is certainly an admirable one. Just as the launching of a European convergence strategy on employment and labour market policies at the Luxembourg Summit was commendable. endTok	30.19331880887298
startTok The labour market and social protection are, in fact, two sides of the same coin, that require harmonised policies and rules. endTok	58.172163170329306
startTok If the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment, flexibility and salary discipline, then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function, and vice versa. endTok	64.9146784640459
startTok Until recently, the European countries fixed, it could be said in an autarkic way, the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets. endTok	78.86550781527733
startTok Budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability. endTok	154.53432511516942
startTok With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency, budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness. endTok	63.58945791162491
startTok The structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot, therefore, be rebalanced through budget deficits and trade. endTok	79.24359946604332
startTok That being the case, in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the Union, and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level, it is left to the labour markets and welfare systems to provide what degree of flexibility there is to remedy both structural and economic disequilibria, the so-called exogenous asymmetric shocks. endTok	71.58362838946867
startTok And therein lies the paradox. endTok	167.50387558193592
startTok Political and monetary convergence in Europe unavoidably entails convergence of the respective rules of the game in the labour market and welfare systems. endTok	95.99565416179283
startTok But, at the same time, the single currency and the absence of labour mobility, as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy, force us into a situation of non-convergence in terms of salaries and welfare, in order to compensate for the differences in marginal productivity at national and regional levels. endTok	46.9965097143122
startTok Hypocrisy and fine-sounding words such as convergence, benchmarking, modernisation and concerted action are not going to extricate us from those contradictions. endTok	122.30875121261496
startTok Either the European Union becomes a genuine federal state with a genuine redistribution of resources, genuine free movement of workers and therefore - but only at that point - common labour and welfare regimes, or it would be better not to deceive and be deceived by hopeless paths to convergence which sound impressive but which, in reality, only cause harm, above all to the most vulnerable. endTok	103.49057966362588
startTok That is something we would do well to recognise. endTok	46.99615116076577
startTok Mr President, unlike several of those who have spoken in today' s debate, I am inclined to endorse the Andersson report, one of the reasons for this being that I can see clear differences between the report and the Commission' s communications. endTok	43.59139056820223
startTok In particular, I am referring to the fact that this report - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defends the European social model' s approach, which is one based on solidarity. endTok	18.904905059065303
startTok I would like to highlight the clear positions adopted against social dumping, together with the right to a basic level of social security, the goal of social convergence, and, in particular, the quite specific points that have been made about equal opportunities for women being the primary objectives of this social policy. endTok	61.5583839672257
startTok I can certainly see that it has its shortcomings in failing to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the European Union, and it is this policy which stands in the way of the aforementioned solidarity-based revival of the European social state, model. endTok	53.42467278691095
startTok All in all, though, I deem this report to be worthwhile. endTok	69.83352909765084
startTok Mr President, I have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection, which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of Europe. endTok	29.908980566104955
startTok This message is contained in the excellent report by Mr Andersson. endTok	49.48296625352416
startTok Europe, the European Union, although it is very strong in economic and political terms, will remain shaky, weak and limited, perhaps inadequate, if we are not able to strengthen it from a social point of view. endTok	56.449458574537445
startTok I believe that the latter means the possibility of employment for those who require it, but also decisive action in support of the socially disadvantaged. endTok	55.00134268291198
startTok Bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income, I believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the European Union. endTok	33.42921338889185
startTok Let us not forget that, in 1999, 717,000 people came here to compensate for our low birth rate. endTok	36.59312677589945
startTok In social terms, it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience, as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain. endTok	43.168444521540444
startTok We must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospects of finding work are threatened or reduced by economic changes, mergers, take-overs, new technologies etc. endTok	145.66547880973982
startTok What is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs, for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity, because sometimes, as the title of the film states, the postman always rings twice. endTok	95.3960603076859
startTok In my humble opinion, it is the responsibility of all European, national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion. endTok	51.0859419026547
startTok It seems to me, Commissioner, that the Commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities. endTok	34.24862250743957
startTok Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his really excellent work, which is the reason why there is broader agreement, and I also thank the Members of Parliament involved for their contribution. endTok	29.044600249192595
startTok I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said. endTok	10.801300751685632
startTok First, I must stress that the debate about social protection issues began several years ago among the European bodies and since 1995 there has been the first statement entitled: "The future of social protection" and there have been statements from the European Parliament, those of Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk. endTok	57.985421837102166
startTok Today, we have the statement by Mr Andersson. endTok	47.25594294037333
startTok I believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection. endTok	28.515033580773398
startTok The second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the European Commission can operate. endTok	19.273648569461123
startTok You know very well that the Treaty provides no legal basis for policies at European level, but there is the agreement expressed at the last Council, there is agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience, as well as the exchange of successful programmes between the Member States. endTok	50.6816449374666
startTok The third observation is that as regards the four issues on which the specific statement focuses, which relate to paid work, the sustainability of pension systems, social convergence and lastly quality in health care, there is a horizontal approach to the issue of women because in each of these categories - as the speakers said - there are special problems relating to women and those problems should in many cases be addressed by separate policies. endTok	85.71492088890255
startTok The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken. endTok	46.37243492579513
startTok As you know, a high-level group has already been set up by the Portuguese Presidency, which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June. endTok	35.19553700097615
startTok The Portuguese Presidency has focused on two things: sustainable pension systems and social accession. endTok	91.66602052003918
startTok I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group. endTok	77.6829547284097
startTok Concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems, the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States, I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion. endTok	38.84692286346168
startTok Of course, we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness, but social protection too must be planned in a way that makes it a factor of economic growth and employment. endTok	35.4465210784319
startTok I think the statement' s content makes this clear. endTok	75.75989082959383
startTok Ladies and gentlemen, the aim is that in the next year, and after a unanimous decision by the Council, we should progress to a first level of coordination, exchange of views, listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies. endTok	66.10772511824496
startTok As many of the speakers have said, I believe a first important step has been taken. endTok	39.01187328849057
startTok Already at the Intergovernmental Conference, social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and I believe we are in a new phase, in which social policy will, to a large extent, become a European policy. endTok	49.19450812862455
startTok Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou. endTok	11.717829204834366
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. endTok	4.628394244073071
startTok WIPO treaty endTok	991.6145077431906
startTok The next item is the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty [COM(1998) 249 - C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)]. endTok	8.63922142292131
startTok Mr President, we are now taking a stance on an important issue, an international agreement, which may influence the prospects for prosperity of many Member States. endTok	39.59999352287486
startTok In my own country, Sweden, one of our biggest export industries is affected, namely the music and sound recording industry. endTok	37.73215747854268
startTok It is about artists' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products. endTok	58.16431366230755
startTok It is about the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty). endTok	45.26230148455435
startTok Without protection under intellectual property law, creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed. endTok	143.62414776477803
startTok Forgeries are big business. endTok	97.98450003797427
startTok It is estimated that, in Europe alone, income of EUR 4.5 billion is lost because of piracy. endTok	40.971572216784324
startTok The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry. endTok	32.447938336164825
startTok This is an historic agreement because the EU is the contracting party. This is the case, in spite of the fact that it is not the EU, but only the Member States, which belong to the organisation. endTok	25.175056466573903
startTok There exists a special clause which requires Parliament' s assent in two cases. endTok	80.73921431344161
startTok With regard to the present agreement, both these conditions are fulfilled. endTok	43.82075213300599
startTok A new institution is being created, an assembly which, in the future, will monitor the agreement and its consequences. endTok	75.44355507947921
startTok The agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co-decision-making procedure. endTok	47.50031630574168
startTok Parliament must therefore give its assent, because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence. endTok	98.20762073037275
startTok The future will show whether it is right, by means of this new parliamentary assembly, to reduce the Commission' s powers regarding these issues. endTok	44.42568346253462
startTok Parliament cannot, in any case, at present do anything about the matter. endTok	54.776672947357966
startTok The agreement complements the Berne Convention in regard to literary works. endTok	64.66002765013285
startTok It creates international legal protection in connection with distribution, sale, rental, public reproduction and the making available of works. endTok	90.36699220824222
startTok It also creates protection for software and databases. endTok	27.20459717960272
startTok There are problems regarding the term "author" . endTok	78.93439447746108
startTok For example, it has not been defined. endTok	21.255999703075215
startTok Another issue, which is somewhat problematic, is that of intermediate storage. endTok	39.48197317836277
startTok This too has not been solved. endTok	29.71339595041669
startTok It is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition. endTok	25.242972786654406
startTok If no definitions are provided in questions such as this, it can lead to their being dealt with differently around the world, with no uniformity of approach. endTok	60.30145148284108
startTok That would not be a good thing. endTok	20.26559223651268
startTok The question of arbitration procedures is still to be resolved, too. endTok	37.89947600915918
startTok Parliament cannot change these details. endTok	91.83695374593167
startTok We can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands. endTok	53.91207705858551
startTok Yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies. endTok	187.20199570284854
startTok Both myself, as rapporteur, and the committee think we ought to say yes. endTok	90.63848053505963
startTok We have here an agreement which, in spite of its defects, constitutes a significant step forward for the issue of copyright. endTok	42.42944379146897
startTok We have of course discussed at length whether Parliament and whether the EU should have powers in regard to patents under intellectual property law. endTok	64.21036768705791
startTok I think they should have. endTok	37.56317740524292
startTok However, there is still no Community legislation in the areas of patent law and protection of designs, and there needs to be. endTok	37.56205795200122
startTok A European patent is in the offing, and that is a good thing. endTok	24.305790100449894
startTok Now, the Union and the Member States are combining to take the first steps in the area of intellectual property law. endTok	29.460396370138103
startTok It is good for us that we have the power to do this, in spite of the fact that we are not completely satisfied. endTok	12.869103474164344
startTok In that way, we can act as a model for the applicant States. endTok	18.921738227341493
startTok We have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement. endTok	78.08534467673036
startTok I want to thank the Commission for its efforts in this area and for the cooperation with the Commission' s officials, which has been quite excellent. endTok	25.82531393571918
startTok Finally, I also want to thank this Chamber for being so good as to listen to these words at this late hour. endTok	35.59981668097237
startTok Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Cederschiöld, on her very serious work. endTok	9.276523454234857
startTok She has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the World Intellectual Property Organisation' s treaties. endTok	111.68149610822167
startTok Their approval is undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the European Union is participating as a contracting party in an international treaty that governs the field of intellectual property. endTok	51.29965664852241
startTok It is a fact that the road has been a long one, mainly because of the legal problem that arose in connection with the extent to which the Community could be considered to have absolute competence in matters of intellectual property. endTok	39.596500368501594
startTok The problem has been overcome. endTok	34.530646324846046
startTok Today we are asked to give our assent in effect to two treaties: the treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretations, performances and phonograms. endTok	67.64048508377569
startTok As regards the first of these, it seems to provide an effective solution for the long-standing demands by the creators of artistic and literary works, while at the same time creating a framework of protection in relation to issues such as distribution, rental and the presentation of their works to the public. endTok	42.12613352070852
startTok As regards the second treaty on performances and phonograms, it must be stressed that for the first time an international treaty signed by the Community as well recognises exclusive rights for performers, interpreters and artists for reproduction, distribution and rental to the public, and the right to fair remuneration for radio broadcasts. endTok	60.59970399818389
startTok In that context a noteworthy and important step forward is the treaty' s treatment of the right of reproduction. endTok	51.400096257121795
startTok Even though, as the Commission says, the texts of the treaties do not contain special provisions to regulate all the respective issues raised by technological development, it can nevertheless be said that within the legislative framework created, performing or interpreting artists enjoy broader protection than that accorded by the Treaty of Rome or even by the Community directives. endTok	85.96833367373726
startTok Interpreting Article 7 of the Treaty, we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction does not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpretations or performances themselves as such that are embodied in recordings, but also protection against copying, whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or temporary, and protection against any other form of production. endTok	118.55582530700755
startTok It would be appropriate, however, for us also to mention some points which should be at the focus of future WIPO work or the work of other diplomatic conferences. endTok	80.70792032072822
startTok First, there is the right of distribution as referred to in Article 8(1). endTok	66.43260486073873
startTok The option accorded to States by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right is dangerous and is one of the Treaty' s most negative points, since there is nothing to prevent States from enacting special conditions for the exhaustion of the right, a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artists. endTok	69.47081354627818
startTok As regards rental rights, on interpretation of Article 9, we can conclude that the exclusive right of rental belongs to artists, interpreters or performers, only if this is laid down by national legislation. I think this conflicts with Article 13. endTok	86.4410468838584
startTok To conclude, I want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights. endTok	47.60246385152146
startTok In the 21st century, the century of knowledge and the invisible economy, intellectual property will be the dominant form of property and will, in many cases, be more important than traditional property. endTok	66.7847755362292
startTok We are at the dawn of an age in which new legislation will be created, where the right to utilise intellectual property will clash head on with the public interest in terms of its dissemination and exploitation by the public at large. endTok	64.73891393320585
startTok Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur for this excellent report which, nonetheless, concludes that, as a Community, our accession to these two WIPO treaties must not boil down to a mere institutional development, however important that may be, i.e. the opportunity for the European Community and the WIPO Assembly to work together. endTok	60.71757045179234
startTok This ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of Europe. endTok	24.269210941716864
startTok However, an objective is emerging behind this issue of Community accession, one I find as yet too theoretical but one that some Member States, nonetheless, find too offensive. endTok	146.91950523474102
startTok This is the affirmation of a European cultural policy. In this connection, I expect our three institutions, Parliament, the Commission and the Council, to be in agreement. endTok	45.93941378527263
startTok Cultural policy means, in particular, defending the role of the arts, recognising the role of authors and setting high cultural standards. endTok	84.95198544653884
startTok In addition, at a time when Europe faces the task of defining a new policy on copyright and neighbouring rights, there is an urgent need - as has just been pointed out several times - to define and redefine what exactly an author is. endTok	69.48300508154215
startTok Our definitions are still too vague and new technologies now make it essential for us to clarify them. endTok	52.58486450982816
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, the adoption of the WIPO agreements was a very positive step in the direction of the global information society. endTok	34.269630634361036
startTok The agreements crystallise the decades-old legacy of copyright, and they represent a precisely considered and balanced solution for the regulation of copyright and neighbouring rights. endTok	155.26940797175715
startTok The entry into force of the treaties and their final form is, however, in addition to this recommendation, dependent on implementation by the parties themselves. endTok	49.68868374639779
startTok In the United States the WIPO Treaty has already entered into force, having been enacted into law by means of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the Treaty by means of this legislation. endTok	45.738094488276
startTok The EU too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what is agreed in the WIPO. endTok	62.94522117456808
startTok It is worrying that the position adopted by the previous Parliament does not support this balanced WIPO system. endTok	40.00513252846952
startTok The opinion on the copyright directive at first reading was very distorted, and, furthermore, the balance is moving in a harmful direction from the point of view of Europeans. endTok	60.76454939956922
startTok The recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in Europe, on the contrary. endTok	34.80844398555374
startTok Parliament' s amendments would mainly improve opportunities for the media enterprises that are well established in the market to move their old, in excess of 80% market share to a new environment with rigid, excessive copyright regulations. endTok	184.95460496719036
startTok I am not now speaking of Charlotte Cederschiöld' s recommendation, which is an excellent paper, but of the matters of copyright that the previous Parliament discussed. endTok	97.08198244560438
startTok On one point of detail, I would like to thank Mrs Cederschiöld for having clarified, for example, the concept of so-called temporary copies in her opinion. endTok	38.766493168326434
startTok There is no consciously adopted position in the WIPO Treaty on temporary copies. endTok	74.31132047665204
startTok If these, which technically speaking are copies, were covered by the protection in force it would make the transfer of information - as the recommendation quite rightly states - expensive and complicated for no good reason. endTok	164.88487408582822
startTok It would be as if the deliveryman had to pay a copyright fee whenever he carried a book to be read by the purchaser. endTok	82.36369403338544
startTok The real benefit of culture is that art and knowledge can be transferred safely and easily from the artist directly to the user, the consumer. endTok	79.92786148723339
startTok The new operational environment is, above all, a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before. endTok	106.72349766964052
startTok It is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account. endTok	19.82424757020725
startTok Parliament has tried to take account of this in its own recommendation. endTok	30.966955809961483
startTok . (NL) Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has carried out. endTok	12.08615306965136
startTok The Commission is under the impression that she has worked fast and effectively. endTok	36.317066374888
startTok This is important. endTok	22.128790146278796
startTok It befits the Commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur. endTok	31.529036008643107
startTok I would like to present the Commission' s conclusion to you without any further ado: it agrees with the conclusions of the draft recommendation and, therefore, with ratification by this Parliament. endTok	35.49690856617102
startTok I would like to stress the importance of both Treaties. endTok	18.787782595565822
startTok Both the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty constitute progress in the international protection of copyright and neighbouring rights and are, as such, a considerable improvement on the Berne Convention and the Treaty of Rome. endTok	54.04361432622327
startTok Both Treaties contribute towards a high level of protection for works and other matters, but offer the public access to the contents of these via electronic networks. endTok	84.25443665884916
startTok The two Treaties explicitly permit the Community to become a party to the Treaties and to play an important role in managing them. endTok	53.54110499248787
startTok Consequently, approval of the Treaties by the Community is of major importance, because it illustrates that the Community sets great store by intellectual property rights. endTok	52.60233174194008
startTok In addition, assent leads to more widespread international recognition of the European Union' s role in terms of copyright. endTok	50.33456972756826
startTok At international level, there is a great deal of support for treaties entering into force more swiftly. endTok	40.30848738128047
startTok These have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen WIPO Member States, including the United States. endTok	31.43502466922255
startTok The entry into force of treaties largely depends on the European Union, because thirty ratification acts are required in order for treaties to enter into effect, and these acts that are signed by the European Union and the Member States, including associated countries, are of vital importance in order to reach this number. endTok	47.92337568299299
startTok The developing countries, too, expect the European Union to bring about ratification swiftly because this would give a strong signal worldwide. endTok	71.63269537393039
startTok In this context, Parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the Information Society, which led to the approval of the Barzanti report in February 1999. endTok	27.738150570290337
startTok This directive is the necessary counterpart of the proposed decision and largely embraces the key principles of the WIPO Treaties. endTok	46.21216761200438
startTok The European Parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of Article 300(3). endTok	66.16455329069682
startTok It is vitally important to give the correct signal to the outside world, in the form of this recommendation. endTok	21.559586568353364
startTok In a nutshell, I would like to reiterate the Commission' s conclusion here: it supports the draft recommendation and hopes that it will be of key importance to anyone with an interest in intellectual property. endTok	36.96764419545802
startTok Thank you, Commissioner. endTok	17.829155313593716
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001

startTok The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed. endTok	14.154461824758924
startTok Are there any comments? endTok	12.892326383115599
startTok Mr President, I see in the Minutes that two Members spoke yesterday about delayed flights to Strasbourg on Monday. endTok	53.51213584161543
startTok I would like to add that the flight from Amsterdam' s Schipol airport was also delayed and then cancelled. endTok	41.624272542010964
startTok We were diverted to Basel-Mulhouse Airport. endTok	29.271415837967872
startTok We were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival. endTok	61.930441779214455
startTok In fact, it took 45 minutes after we arrived before the bus appeared at the airport. endTok	107.50808472490714
startTok We finally got here, on Monday at 8.30 p.m., after some of us had spent more than 12 hours travelling. endTok	62.09366616175205
startTok This sort of service and difficulty in getting to Strasbourg on a Monday is quite hopeless. endTok	81.81030467415194
startTok If the French Government insists that we continue to meet in Strasbourg, it could at least ensure, where flights are diverted to Basle, that buses arrive on time to meet the diverted passengers, otherwise it is quite pointless for us to try to arrive here on Monday and attend to any kind of business. endTok	49.87780816060487
startTok I wonder if that could be added to the Minutes. endTok	27.08060081812611
startTok Mr President, I was booked on the same flight and I am rather embarrassed to admit that the airline was KLM, our national airline company. endTok	31.151519963430676
startTok I hope that next time, also if any other airline company is involved, things will run more smoothly. endTok	123.8349585217858
startTok (The Minutes were approved) endTok	22.452217819019545
startTok Mr President, I would just like to draw your attention to something that concerns today' s agenda. We decided on Monday that the Council' s statement on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Geneva Convention was to be postponed. endTok	23.12913355318532
startTok I would just like to clarify that we will only be talking about the other items on this agenda today, and not about the Geneva Convention. endTok	38.32028553667331
startTok This item has been postponed until the next part-session in March. endTok	29.903697068054786
startTok It was erroneously included in today' s agenda. endTok	32.962526041239585
startTok Mr Swoboda, I can confirm what you have just said and there is, in fact, a printing error. endTok	28.76659398183689
startTok The document that has been distributed contains inaccuracies, because the decision has been taken to postpone the debate. endTok	33.93271155676851
startTok Mr President, I just want to say that, as I was walking in this morning, I noticed two people smoking outside the Hemicycle. endTok	30.521679747740972
startTok The smell is absolutely disgusting! endTok	21.483568749539586
startTok Can you please do something about it? endTok	22.798618099875995
startTok I cannot do anything about it myself, but you are quite right. We need a quick way of educating people, including those who do not obey the rules decided upon in this House. endTok	51.5395970798436
startTok Regarding the problems caused by air travel delays, perhaps everybody who has had difficulty reaching Strasbourg for the present part-session should form a small group - although I am not sure that it will be small - to discuss the precise nature of the problems encountered. endTok	81.97376442471332
startTok Coherence of EU policies with development endTok	190.41494069100438
startTok The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the coherence of EU policies with development. endTok	14.710390025005243
startTok Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the Council presidency, particularly in view of the very important role that the European Parliament is bound to play in the near future, given the need to strengthen development policies at European Union level. endTok	20.325593888914707
startTok The subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today, is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy. endTok	55.087328441995375
startTok I shall, of course, give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that I shall be making. I would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel, at EU level, to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life - not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years, which has benefited people in all walks of life, throughout the world, in terms of well-being and improvements in living conditions - with the fact that, at the same time, there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world. endTok	58.82796786969591
startTok This endangers the stability of the international system and jeopardises peace. endTok	40.97488383279805
startTok We are all therefore duty-bound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet. endTok	76.3391570065845
startTok The consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets. endTok	37.12013645810029
startTok A serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged, which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments, which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies. endTok	124.29752528934496
startTok We will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas: endTok	53.42817569625209
startTok Firstly, there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players, by which I mean donors, requiring greater coordination, greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems. endTok	122.99929353713212
startTok At the same time, however, there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate, particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems, together with a need to focus special attention on these countries' own policies for reducing poverty. endTok	107.11361717156265
startTok The second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development. endTok	34.220658899525375
startTok This means not just an approach limited to development aid as the sole element of this policy, but a policy that also increasingly takes account of the role of other policies in the spheres of finance, trade and investment. Furthermore, this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approached both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor countries' own policies. endTok	91.496190761504
startTok A third aspect of this new model that I would like to emphasise is a policy aimed at achieving our objectives. endTok	46.22982156184399
startTok Since 1995, following a concerted international effort between the main donor states, involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the OECD' s Development Assistance Committee, it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies, both at national and international level. endTok	126.30442309453646
startTok As you will know, the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50% by 2015, by increasing compulsory schooling, by significantly reducing child mortality rates, and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective. endTok	135.6686312743863
startTok This would mean moving away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world' s population lives, and moving away from the extremely poor living conditions suffered by over a billion people. This is an extraordinary state of affairs, which certainly means that if this objective is to be achieved the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively. endTok	87.50053244120967
startTok And that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise. Particularly in recent years, development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter, and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership. endTok	61.750448240427694
startTok The concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here, as has the Bretton Woods system. endTok	48.48520627325238
startTok I have in mind, in particular, the important impetus given to this debate by the World Bank, especially through its Comprehensive Framework document, and by the International Monetary Fund, where, for the first time, an institution of this kind has put the problem of reducing poverty at the centre of its policy guidelines and has forged a hitherto unimaginable link, for a body of this type, between debt relief and poverty. endTok	87.18733355417139
startTok This new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European Union in this context. endTok	32.95691527947919
startTok The Portuguese Presidency has highlighted the need for the European Union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a leading role - and a more active one - in this movement to reform international development policies, and to create greater scope for coordination, in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system. endTok	65.20166394046613
startTok If we are to strengthen the European Union' s role in international development policies, we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action. endTok	31.453204556949487
startTok Firstly, we need to make the EU' s development policy more effective. endTok	25.950367465575784
startTok As you know, an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies, and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency. endTok	98.67914682837956
startTok The main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues. endTok	113.38511688098956
startTok The key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies, the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the Union' s present cooperation policies, the need to make the EU' s aid management more efficient and, in particular, to review its mechanisms for intervention, and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid. endTok	71.8565687466014
startTok A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more. endTok	65.1820176568048
startTok It is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the Member States' national policies, which are not always complementary or well coordinated. A great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the European Union and its Member States is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual Member States and the proposals and actions of the European institutions. endTok	49.01880726719548
startTok In this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost, as soon as possible, to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the Member States and European Union policies are coordinated and complementary. endTok	29.14020137862493
startTok The third aspect I would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of EU policies, the central theme of today' s debate. endTok	52.085250717631546
startTok Firstly, we are all aware that it is not enough just to improve aid conditions and that there is a need for better coordination with other European Union policies, so that development objectives can be achieved, not merely through aid and support, but also, first and foremost, through a more integrated approach to the various different policies that contribute to the objectives of development. endTok	47.744610155667054
startTok As you know, a Council Resolution was approved, in June 1997, under which the Commission was required to present evaluation reports. endTok	99.34702105722434
startTok The first such report was presented to the Council in May 1999, and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination, notably in the fields of peace building, food safety, fisheries and migration. endTok	90.4822892666209
startTok But as you will also be aware, we are waiting for a Commission communication on coherence, together with the communication on development policy. endTok	52.30451773010947
startTok Over the coming months, that is to say during the Portuguese Presidency, this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the Commission has undertaken to present to us. endTok	24.770049892271697
startTok It is evident that the scope for achieving coherence between policies will always be limited and it is only natural for there to be some contradictions between policies as these are means of balancing and weighting the contradictory and conflicting interests within the European Union. Only in this way is it possible to manage some degree of contradiction between policies. endTok	58.002760730498586
startTok But, quite apart from this, we would like to emphasise that, if we are to strengthen the coherence of European Union policies in the present circumstances and in the economic situation currently facing the Union, we need to give serious consideration to various issues associated with the dynamics of the European Union itself. endTok	34.33556468615914
startTok By this I mean, of course, the internal dynamics of the European Union. endTok	30.72262141199399
startTok We know that the European Union has its own dynamics, which stem above all from the Treaty of Amsterdam, which has reinforced its political dimension. This inevitably has important consequences for the proposal for coherence in policies relating to development. endTok	42.76227302011246
startTok We will also have to await the outcome of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference as regards enlargement, to see to what extent the internal dynamics of the European Union are directed towards increasing the coherence of its policies, and, as regards development in particular, to what extent it also contributes to appropriate institutional arrangements for achieving this objective. endTok	49.750301094239816
startTok The second aspect that we need to consider, in relation to the coherence of policies, is development policy in the context of the Union' s foreign policy. endTok	27.85896659286282
startTok We know that the Union has entered a new era as regards its foreign policy, and we know that, with the creation of the High Representative, of the Rapid Reaction Force and of the military crisis management capacity, there is a whole trend towards confirming the status of the European Union that we should not underestimate when we consider the role of development policies. We also know that there are issues associated with political dialogue, with the adoption of common positions or joint actions, with the preparation of joint strategies, with preventive diplomacy, and with the development of regional capacity for crisis prevention and management. endTok	56.02392157169654
startTok There can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union' s foreign policy. endTok	36.39130359904041
startTok It has to be said that, in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy, the European Union is bound to go down the same road as many Member States have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies. endTok	36.16876999625404
startTok The success of this is bound to involve a need to strengthen decision-making mechanisms and institutional structures relating to the common foreign and security policy, so as to secure better coordination between instruments of development policy and instruments of foreign policy. endTok	55.74574404088111
startTok In this context, we are convinced that we need to move away from the post­colonial model towards to a truly European model of development aid. I say this because we know that, in Europe, development policy has been very much shaped by the policies of certain Member States, in view of the post-colonial concerns of those states. endTok	45.19867713998157
startTok The third aspect that needs to be considered is European Union policy and Member States' policy. endTok	58.195607051485055
startTok Coherence of policies at European level certainly means better coordination of Member States' policies with the European Union' s development policy. endTok	44.727866276693945
startTok If we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies, it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in European Union development policy. endTok	66.62942326504337
startTok Ladies and gentlemen, the fourth and final aspect that I would like to draw to your attention, regarding development policy, is, of course, the Development Council. There have been discussions, especially in recent months, about the role the Development Council could play in relation to EU policies. endTok	62.678358207886
startTok As you know, there is a glaring difference between the status of development policies and other EU policies - you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the EDF' s financing, or rather lack of financing. endTok	68.97194299094791
startTok It is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the European Union' s policies without the Development Council playing a more active and interventionist role in relation to political decisions, which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other Councils, in other decision-making forums, ranging from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Council. Up to now, the Development Council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions. endTok	53.318649824397575
startTok So without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decision making which, although it directly impacts on the European Union' s development policy, is largely being dealt with outside this decision-making forum, it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent European Union policy on development objectives. endTok	48.1111489423451
startTok The views of the European Parliament on this issue too, will certainly be both timely and welcome. endTok	38.53504836655068
startTok . Let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the EU and ACP countries. endTok	51.984984335002785
startTok I would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations. endTok	32.99835841305743
startTok I saw Member States working as a team, which was indeed a wonderful experience. endTok	86.378170632091
startTok There was also deep satisfaction on both sides when this was over, not just because it was over, but because we all knew that we had achieved something together, the EU and the 71 ACP countries. endTok	69.96638601357242
startTok That is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation. endTok	36.601686493016935
startTok I shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement. endTok	47.247088147990844
startTok We explicitly address corruption; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever. endTok	108.67871676435878
startTok We promote participatory approaches, we ensure the consultation of civil society on the reforms and policies to be supported by the EU. endTok	77.2169237328988
startTok We refocus development policies on poverty reduction strategies. endTok	191.43440394444423
startTok We base the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country's needs, but also of its policy performance. endTok	72.70896494417275
startTok We create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector. endTok	30.38326704485314
startTok We rationalise instruments and introduce a new system of rolling programming, allowing the Community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme. endTok	96.72171154929782
startTok We decentralise administrative and, in some cases, financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective. endTok	118.3647323216992
startTok We improve the policy framework for trade and investment development. endTok	165.3573678157499
startTok We enhance cooperation in all areas important to trade, including new issues such as labour standards and the linkages between environment and trade. endTok	114.68080848220315
startTok After Seattle I am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements. endTok	47.40730500934518
startTok Let me turn to some of the more important points. endTok	19.682490117610563
startTok Firstly the agreement on political issues. endTok	109.06474951708596
startTok The new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership, a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active Community support. endTok	81.27501026822952
startTok Secondly, a new procedure has been drawn up for cases of violations of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. endTok	40.87468689643349
startTok In comparison with the current procedure, the new one puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process, with a view to conducting an effective dialogue leading to measures to be taken to redress the situation. endTok	41.984385416550886
startTok In cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements, measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be notified. endTok	99.04170265385525
startTok Thirdly, the EU and the ACP have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption. endTok	75.02987387328234
startTok This is a real innovation, both in the EU/ACP context and in international relations in general. endTok	60.87179271731524
startTok This procedure will be applied, not only in cases of corruption involving EDF money, but also more widely in any country where the EC is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development. endTok	95.02781657997424
startTok It is thus not confined to EC activities. endTok	75.07983523664072
startTok This is a very important aspect, taking into account the fundability of public finances. endTok	12.809869897693021
startTok By adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement, the EU and the ACP States are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors. endTok	77.75388570812521
startTok Another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement is migration. endTok	84.16160174717905
startTok We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area. endTok	27.37082233360657
startTok This new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines espoused by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in Finland in October 1999. endTok	30.222876519263608
startTok The European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions. endTok	46.29831917778067
startTok The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives, in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU, and measures facilitating their integration. endTok	69.97722968990408
startTok We also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration. endTok	140.18241330360706
startTok The EU and the ACP states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining, within a framework to be negotiated with each and every ACP country, the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present on the territories of each party. endTok	93.58278941144475
startTok This also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons. endTok	64.20032580469092
startTok These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance. endTok	106.34843937951749
startTok The agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid. endTok	77.1240094355156
startTok We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters. endTok	107.27994667862802
startTok We have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiations is concerned. endTok	34.12679801001565
startTok Negotiations will start no later than 2002. endTok	243.61550022507848
startTok This two-year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries' capacity to conduct trade negotiations. endTok	127.33577651169885
startTok A six-year period is programmed for these negotiations. endTok	45.95962616448659
startTok We will take account of the economic and social constraints of the ACP countries in two ways: firstly, through human and social development policies to accompany economic and trade reforms and, secondly, by helping the ACP states to become active players in the international economic and trade system through capacity-building and cooperation in multilateral forums. endTok	62.66287846195798
startTok This approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime. endTok	74.88815195819156
startTok Economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their ACP partners. endTok	86.20366746638342
startTok Domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transferred, all of which will boost the ACP countries' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy. endTok	132.35586369872723
startTok In addition, the agreements with the EU will act as an anchor. endTok	35.48084919351598
startTok They will lock in the economic reforms, just as national and economic reforms will be stabilised by both parties' commitments under the agreements. endTok	74.11195099638907
startTok The rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction. endTok	56.45909575447281
startTok Another important aspect is the improvement of the EU' s trade regime for all least-developed countries, 39 of which are actually in the ACP group. endTok	62.503224253212295
startTok This process will take place in the coming five years so that, by 2005, the LDCs' exporters will have free access for essentially all their products on the EU market. endTok	49.01206433525428
startTok As regards the volume of the next EDF, the EU has made its financial proposal. endTok	51.5088371168599
startTok It is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make Community aid more effective. endTok	46.83543666135647
startTok Today about EUR 9.5 billion of previous EDF resources are uncommitted. endTok	116.44539459537569
startTok The EU is committed to mobilising these remaining balances, plus the new EDF resources, over a seven-year period, that is to say, before the entry into force of the next financial protocol. endTok	49.37951469862403
startTok This will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period. endTok	118.94778509310274
startTok We are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity, we are moving into a period of increased activity. endTok	54.44711232901625
startTok Such a commitment entails an in-depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides. endTok	87.56648041904708
startTok There is a very real link between the reform process in the Commission as such, and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the ACP countries. endTok	27.36192270883212
startTok Turning to our development policy, I would say that the global context has changed drastically. endTok	45.130170896630105
startTok The marginalisation of many economies, increased poverty in the world, the need for better management of environmental interdependence, the destabilising effects of migration and the worrying consequences of armed conflicts and pandemic diseases are all major concerns. endTok	62.883481384346666
startTok It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves. endTok	140.94147136351415
startTok Fortunately evaluations of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges I have just mentioned. endTok	96.0707533659261
startTok To focus on the input coming from the evaluations, I would mention the following problems: the objections of Community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence. endTok	80.81748312359665
startTok This is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the Member States. endTok	42.51596271119777
startTok The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments, procedures and institutional mechanisms. endTok	68.68267306678699
startTok Often policies are more determined by the instruments available, than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities. endTok	214.6978521546233
startTok Human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage. endTok	29.472423751396985
startTok On average, to manage $US 10 million of aid there are 2.9 staff at the Commission, compared with 4.3 at the World Bank and between 4 and 9 in major Member States. endTok	115.39324904638667
startTok This is a real problem: there are too many different financial instruments, each with its own characteristics and in particular a series of different budget headings. endTok	56.2933129206057
startTok This is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system. endTok	36.41769798582311
startTok In order to face and solve these problems the Community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with Member States and Parliament. endTok	39.483131023361146
startTok It is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way, which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework, that is, the Council and Parliament. endTok	47.42869469740816
startTok The lack of concerted action among the 15 Member States themselves and between them and the Community also needs to be addressed. endTok	36.72693390609979
startTok By focusing the Community's development policy on internationally agreed targets and strategies we will pave the way for better complementarity with the Member States. endTok	62.99930072388033
startTok This is very much the line also just presented by Minister Amado. endTok	92.56262449513757
startTok When we talk policies nowadays, we engage in a process of convergence. endTok	134.17208491483774
startTok This is part of the solution. endTok	23.93456111950501
startTok We are in the process of formulating new policy guidelines and we need to identify priority areas for Community action. endTok	62.42905668143353
startTok Everything has become more and more complex. endTok	92.50764575493463
startTok This is also true of development cooperation. endTok	30.932060816820922
startTok No single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes, ranging from macro-economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross-cutting themes such as gender, environment, good governance and institutional reforms. endTok	109.73021361743126
startTok It is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country. endTok	73.83097186219187
startTok This should be done at Member State level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for Community action. endTok	34.884479172759754
startTok This is where we want to go. endTok	26.317399365509022
startTok To identify the EC's priority areas of support, account has to be taken of the Community's specific features in relation to the Member States and to international institutions. endTok	59.50228693049755
startTok I will mention just a few: our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to ensure synergies between aid and economic cooperation; our neutrality and defence of overall Community interests; the fact that we represent a critical mass and are able to do relatively large jobs compared to what individual Member States can normally do. endTok	88.25537698407457
startTok Also, our presence on the ground: basically, I find the biggest value we represent is the very fact that being a successful regional cooperation endeavour ourselves, we are seen as a neutral, welcome partner for this experiment world-wide - something which nobody else can claim to be. endTok	173.78232937148405
startTok It is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework. endTok	50.430871318358484
startTok It is this dual challenge that the Commission has to take up, by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement. endTok	38.93988374147289
startTok We will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested. endTok	45.54347716495942
startTok I see the process not quite but almost as important as the content and we will put all our resources into participating actively and we invite everybody to participate. endTok	119.50492934135342
startTok Parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect. endTok	78.03699269514725
startTok This will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of continued quality control effort and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing. endTok	53.939500846979804
startTok Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Amado and Mr Nielson. endTok	7.932574909810706
startTok I am pleased that Mr Amado talked about the EDF. endTok	19.434374893124037
startTok The problem, however, should not be sought within this Parliament or the Commission; it is the Council that needs to make a decision on the EDF budget. This sermon, therefore, really belongs in the Council. endTok	53.12863737113872
startTok Mr President, I thank Mr Nielson. endTok	10.477871691628833
startTok He has talked extensively about the new Lomé Convention, although this is not really the topic of this morning' s meeting. endTok	38.0767860685135
startTok We want to talk about coherence. endTok	26.164021017280298
startTok This is the topic. endTok	24.063788771218835
startTok Ever since the early nineties, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers have recognised that this coherence of European policy is leaves something to be desired, especially in the field of development cooperation and in other EU policies. endTok	46.11344319749881
startTok This problem has been highlighted on several occasions, to whit in 1992, in 1995 and 1997. endTok	58.94334390473495
startTok The examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us. endTok	81.35884166355403
startTok I have raised questions regarding this issue for years now. endTok	50.28858007952445
startTok In fact, the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997. endTok	37.13654822643701
startTok In 1998, it was agreed that the European Commission should publish an annual report which highlights any improvements. endTok	33.15663594890734
startTok But what have we seen since then? endTok	236.31081993180425
startTok Fine words, as is the case again today, but no report. It is too crazy for words, really. endTok	184.9569861996812
startTok It is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy. Time and time again, good intentions are formulated but nothing is implemented. endTok	50.077107460696915
startTok It is, therefore, with good reason that we bring this up here today. endTok	43.27678170782385
startTok I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions. endTok	19.790604784618854
startTok A number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production. endTok	85.80001785808871
startTok In the Union, sugar is produced from sugar beet. endTok	98.68277004395894
startTok In order to prevent this cheap sugar from the developing countries from competing with the more expensive EU sugar, a considerable import levy is imposed on cane sugar. endTok	70.21045760552927
startTok The result is that the export of cane sugar from the relevant countries to the Union is significantly restricted. endTok	59.95927608262261
startTok At the same time, we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid. endTok	36.98058507903093
startTok A Minister from one of the Caribbean islands which produce sugar cane once told me: If you just allowed our sugar access to the European Union, we would not need your development aid at all. endTok	133.21113470724404
startTok Another example is cacao. endTok	52.12857060741898
startTok The European Union intends to permit 5% of alternative fats in chocolate in order to harmonise the internal market. endTok	38.14537011483037
startTok This could just as well be 0% - the internal market would still be harmonised. endTok	96.49354622629757
startTok By pitching the percentage level at 5%, which is now likely to be the case, it is almost certain that hundreds of thousands of small cacao farmers in developing countries will be put at a disadvantage. endTok	40.24206777224391
startTok It seems to be heading this way nevertheless. endTok	123.7609920861429
startTok What are we actually doing then? endTok	106.47605376705685
startTok This is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what Brussels actually does? endTok	131.3182852672289
startTok It seems that European industry is more important here than our own principles, our own coherences and the interests of the developing countries. endTok	52.27559447441216
startTok There are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes. endTok	29.00369674925936
startTok Why institute an oil boycott against Haiti and not against Burma, where an elected President is imprisoned, parliament has been sent home and some of the MPs have been put in jail or even murdered? endTok	65.90330242057581
startTok Why not institute an oil boycott against Sudan, where a great deal of the fighting is still going on, with weapons, no less, funded by the oil companies which are based in the same areas where the refugees are? endTok	66.77257983773761
startTok The inconsistency is astonishing. endTok	14.15007203824601
startTok Here too, Mr Nielson mentioned another good example regarding the new Lomé Convention. endTok	80.90732371721536
startTok If the new Lomé Convention is simply put into operation, without eradicating all these inconsistencies from the policy, the policy will then be built on shifting sands - to use a biblical expression. endTok	67.60359714569732
startTok The Council has quoted examples of inconsistency time after time: in agriculture, commerce, in conflict prevention, in the peace operations, in the fisheries sector, migration and environment. endTok	62.824168701942234
startTok Mr Nielson, what we are waiting for is a good report on these inconsistencies and a number of specific proposals to eliminate these from the policy. endTok	44.27060324999326
startTok Once again, all your fine examples, your marvellous policy - and I include the Secretary of State in this - will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground. endTok	82.19655630912746
startTok This is also at the request of the citizens. endTok	26.156748533346953
startTok We have been saying this ourselves since back in 1992: this is the topic of this debate. endTok	63.40778701942878
startTok I hope the message strikes home and I really hope that you will soon produce a report which contains measures. endTok	54.3510194910804
startTok Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the same line as Mrs Maij-Weggen, I believe that we have a number of representatives here who all feel passionate about contributing to this debate. endTok	24.241123484539326
startTok The topic touches the very core of the European Union. endTok	29.568890236590896
startTok Let me begin by specifying precisely what we are debating. Article 178, Title XX of the consolidated Treaties of the European Union reads as follows: "The Community shall take account of the objectives referred to in Article 177 in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries" . endTok	39.404202413441176
startTok What are the objectives which each EU policy needs to take into account? endTok	34.19636234189504
startTok Article 177 specifies these objectives as "sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries, and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them" , the "smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the campaign against poverty in the developing countries" . endTok	44.425090319627984
startTok Mr President, these are no arbitrary objectives. These are articles, statutory articles, which form part of the European acquis established by law with which the European institutions and Member States must comply. endTok	73.07555403280854
startTok Every statutory article should, of course, not just be judged on its regularity, but also on the importance of its contents. endTok	52.63889000140633
startTok I am of the opinion - and luckily I am not alone in this - that the principle of policy coherence is essential to every government which aims to be a credible servant of its citizens. endTok	49.260973662439426
startTok The interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government. endTok	51.30132006309984
startTok This is important if the government wants to gain the trust of society, and also important from the point of view of effectiveness, for coherence is required in order to use the restricted means efficiently. endTok	55.24244696866997
startTok We should not make reality out to be more rose-tinted than it really is. endTok	50.4096059544684
startTok Reality is obstinate. endTok	71.47032588761427
startTok It is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner, without any backhandedness. endTok	34.352211339087184
startTok The government is obliged to show up any of its dilemmas, and to show where, when and why, problems occur with coherence of policy, rather than sweeping it all under the carpet. endTok	132.67464800399478
startTok What we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be toyed with at leisure. endTok	23.989319930496976
startTok Poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention. endTok	127.16787940320204
startTok It is only natural that we in Parliament guard the interests of our citizens, but it is also in the interest of our citizens to live in a stable, international environment, in which the goal of human safety is pursued. endTok	45.8212537540848
startTok This is a moral interest, a safety interest and is, ultimately, even in the interest of our economy. endTok	70.47755729994597
startTok In whose interest is it really if European taxpayers' money is used to support economic development in Namibia, and if, at the same time, the economic activity of poor cattle farmers in the same country is drastically undercut by rigorous export subsidies, financed by the same tax payers? endTok	75.85127022620838
startTok We are all acting as if this is not really happening, but we all know that it is. endTok	20.299398773484707
startTok It is not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand. endTok	40.6514204638841
startTok The general interest of policy coherence is, therefore, a responsibility of the Commission as a whole, of the Council, and of the European Parliament. endTok	25.846176912030746
startTok This responsibility cannot only be borne by the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, however much we like to see him or hear him talk, or by the Development Council or the parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation. endTok	79.30582011844213
startTok What we need here is an integral approach. endTok	51.51818354984524
startTok After the lucid and closely reasoned explanation of this approach presented by both Mr Amado and Mr Nielson, I would like to note that we are very much looking forward to the proposals, not only by Mr Nielson, but by the entire Commission, in order to make the policy coherent as a whole. endTok	40.96595578095553
startTok This is why we urge the Commission, in this sharp and clear resolution, to develop specific instruments. endTok	61.183630645825644
startTok We need to pinpoint, and draw up an inventory of, the problem areas for coherence. endTok	44.881637622604195
startTok We need to make it evident which problems we are solving and which we have not yet solved. endTok	37.70514302739263
startTok This is why I advocate a monitoring centre for coherence which makes this apparent. endTok	49.38861606143195
startTok This is why we need to set up inter-service task groups in the Commission, in the Council and in Parliament which can police the attainment of coherence. endTok	57.85975251591225
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if our neighbour' s roof is leaking, we can lend him pots and pans to collect the water, but it is, of course, more effective to help him plug the leak in the roof. endTok	27.8278591149447
startTok The crisis in last year' s Commission has been solved today, but the Commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach, which, no doubt, the entire Parliament will soon demand in the resolution. endTok	59.05641173977815
startTok I would wish the Commissioner all the best in his battle within the Commission and wish Mr Amado the same within the Council. endTok	64.31869319771438
startTok Mr President, let us be clear from the outset: when it comes to cooperation, coherence is far from being the watchword. endTok	41.14515185986812
startTok The Treaties provide for the European Union to help developing countries to develop but, as the previous speakers have explained so well, there are various distortions to these declarations. endTok	41.60632389706006
startTok The first area of incoherence is the lack of consultation between the Union and the Member States on individual cooperation policies. endTok	25.059701161461643
startTok This gives rise to serious malfunctions, because some Community programmes duplicate national programmes, whereas they might have helped other projects about which nothing is done. endTok	109.4349840351816
startTok And let us not forget that the de facto neo-colonial policy of certain Member States does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop. endTok	40.52676862274597
startTok The second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes. endTok	40.77408364197121
startTok We state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to pour hundreds of thousands of euros into Swiss bank accounts via the portfolios of a number of Heads of State. endTok	63.8605349895303
startTok The third area of incoherence is human rights. endTok	29.77180605271538
startTok We say that we want to protect human rights. endTok	23.317724764870476
startTok We encourage developing countries to respect human rights. endTok	68.96049878241487
startTok We even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights. endTok	102.4132319527878
startTok We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns. endTok	125.88095832613142
startTok And yet, at the same time, we allow the arms trade to proliferate and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious forms of arms such as anti-personnel mines. endTok	43.26550561535309
startTok Nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations. endTok	80.92916272811492
startTok The fourth area of incoherence in the European Union' s cooperation policy is this: how do you expect to help development by pillaging the natural resources of the people you are helping. endTok	72.51016016143996
startTok The European Union must leave fish for local fishermen to feed local populations instead of systematically destroying maritime resources through intensive fisheries. endTok	124.29847360782219
startTok We must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them. endTok	148.79225611344404
startTok I will not even mention oil; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as Elf and Total in Africa. endTok	59.74801993969933
startTok Furthermore, and this will perhaps soon be the fifth area of incoherence, we demand respect for biodiversity, for example so that everyone can produce from their own seeds and preserve the richness of nature; but at the same time, and this was apparent during recent negotiations, we force ACP countries to sign TRIPS agreements. endTok	94.55705376298087
startTok These agreements risk being extended to living organisms, which would mean the death of biodiversity and the return of de facto slavery for small-scale farmers in the south, at the hands of the multinationals. endTok	69.32755785083464
startTok And yet, and this is the sixth area of incoherence, we do not defend the application of the current Treaties. endTok	45.15076998981196
startTok On the one hand, we vote for a budget line for the fight against AIDS and, on the other hand, we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licences within the framework of the very same TRIPS, despite the fact that this would allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and halt the AIDS massacre. endTok	30.186639202339236
startTok Similarly, during the WTO negotiations, at a time when, to quote the second paragraph of the Schwaiger report, "the current trade liberalisation process has not yet brought significant benefits for large parts of the population of developing countries, especially the poor" , the European Union continues to defend the liberalisation of trade and intends to put an end to the system of favouring ACP countries, albeit with a transitional period of several years, instead of strengthening it, especially for the poorest countries. endTok	64.44680461860558
startTok The eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature. endTok	41.0197782235231
startTok We are always saying think globally, act locally. endTok	300.9028894290391
startTok And yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern NGOs at the expense of local programmes and southern NGOs. endTok	88.28218820905097
startTok And what about agriculture and the environment? Still more problems, still more areas of incoherence which I might have highlighted, not to mention research, emigration or health. endTok	227.77038788592418
startTok In short, we claim that we want to help developing countries and, at the same time, we encourage the liberalisation of trade, which we acknowledge runs counter to that very objective. endTok	56.07333807075153
startTok I say it again, the European Union' s cooperation and development policy is not coherent. and on behalf of the Green Group I call on Parliament, the institutions and the Commission to make a joint effort, at long last, to put some coherence into our policy. endTok	43.98463717615031
startTok Mr President, I feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate, not just because development is in general an important issue, but because it is also a topical one. endTok	37.40370137134237
startTok Seattle was a failure, and north-south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. endTok	157.93918960220645
startTok The meeting held in that North American city demonstrated that globalisation is having seriously unbalanced and negative effects on poorer countries. endTok	125.05175882115354
startTok The Tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is being held right now in Bangkok, and is suffering the consequences of that failure. endTok	82.59451638318866
startTok In the meantime, however, as has already been mentioned, the negotiations on the future of the Lomé Convention have been concluded. endTok	32.109057179001276
startTok This goes to show just how topical this subject is. endTok	137.45589847408988
startTok We could also add to the list the next EU-OAU summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in Cairo in April. endTok	71.74413421344535
startTok However, I would also like to add that any analysis, no matter how superficial, inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something - or even a great deal - is amiss with north-south relations, including those between the European Union and the less developed countries. endTok	52.028171214155954
startTok You only have to realise that the category of "least developed countries" has grown from 25 to 48 countries over the last 30 years, and now represents 13% of the world' s population, yet this category only accounts for 0.4% of world exports and 0.6% of world imports or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich countries has fallen by around 23% since 1990. endTok	133.59534864249582
startTok Furthermore, the recent Community budget cuts in this area, for the present financial year, are part of this trend, as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message. endTok	53.18292989673793
startTok Michel Camdessus, a fair man who is still director of the International Monetary Fund, said in his speech at the opening of the UNCTAD conference, and I am now quoting, that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other. He was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries. endTok	81.2103927207418
startTok It may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position, but he did indeed say this, and I heard it with my own ears. endTok	80.77564301590158
startTok This comment certainly seems to me to reflect the current situation, and I accordingly wish to stress that it is vital to rethink north-south relations and break the mould. endTok	62.790176821837825
startTok In particular, we need to reconsider the role of the European Union in this area, as I am certain that one of the Union' s strategic objectives must be to promote a new and more equitable world order. It is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation, bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based, and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries, particularly in this context. endTok	41.3755589866288
startTok A new agreement has been reached with the ACP countries. endTok	33.029457241416104
startTok This is a positive development in itself, especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue. endTok	38.3570949557716
startTok We will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact terms of this agreement in greater depth, but meanwhile there is no doubt that the European negotiators were more timid and failed to live up to the proposals that we formulated at the appropriate time, even if the new agreement does include some new and innovative points. endTok	60.02180818006965
startTok Certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these. endTok	102.31912242914645
startTok This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions, and this is certainly true of the European Union, especially in the field of good governance and trade. endTok	67.20543586674775
startTok But it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group, which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle. endTok	131.94991875250614
startTok I particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging, especially as regards trade, and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area. endTok	48.677861740326485
startTok Lastly, we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries. endTok	48.62303246731277
startTok I have in mind budgetary and financing aspects, indebtedness, assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety, humanitarian, educational and health-related issues, and also fields such as the environment, investment and access to information and new technologies. This also applies to the sphere of trade, where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other Community policies, and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the Member States. endTok	73.65111591826681
startTok We cannot simply forge ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong-headed. endTok	45.19700685916522
startTok Mr President, having listened to the Council and the Commission today, I just had to look at my agenda. endTok	29.135456577783565
startTok Yes, it does say: 'Coherence of different Union policies with development policy' . endTok	157.5150797729625
startTok But we have not heard a single word on this subject, and I find that deeply embarrassing. endTok	25.58394015795603
startTok We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years. endTok	24.613275024770324
startTok It ought to have been here in writing today and, after having heard Mr Nielson' s speech, I can well imagine that he is up against a lot of powerful opposition in the Commission. endTok	73.03800062503149
startTok I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence, and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today. endTok	53.25261296189751
startTok Because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence, I shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism, namely obliging the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new, relevant legislation from this aspect. endTok	75.42967028123263
startTok I also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the EU' s common agricultural policy has had on developing countries: dumping of beef in Sahel and South Africa, tomato purée in West Africa and milk powder in Jamaica. endTok	41.05161429189704
startTok The examples are, I hope, all well known. In any case, they are known all too well to the producers in the ACP countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with EU-subsidised products. endTok	68.46721899016772
startTok European taxpayers contribute EUR 40 billion per year in support of agriculture in the EU. endTok	83.3374720483843
startTok This is money which is helping to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries, which accounts for 69% of the total work force there compared with 1.7% in the EU. endTok	50.20640971450262
startTok Add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34% of the developing countries' gross national product, compared with 5.3% in the EU. endTok	65.70236275933668
startTok There is neither coherence nor human decency here. endTok	241.88489470368194
startTok Why will neither the Council nor the Commission admit the fact? endTok	84.72960310176508
startTok Mr President, how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental. endTok	266.7417128923228
startTok The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council. endTok	58.3976148448432
startTok They pointed out that the UK, France and Germany far exceed the other countries of the European Union at present in terms of population. endTok	57.915979996940564
startTok They then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not surrender its veto. endTok	66.98845060652464
startTok Is the Council discussing this issue? endTok	47.42402477206307
startTok Is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of Council members, rather than a vote reflecting the population in Europe which they democratically represent? endTok	109.77035303811897
startTok Have the UK representatives indicated to the Council their decision and proposal and what, if any, consideration has been given to it? endTok	129.08815813160996
startTok As this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this Union, surely it should receive priority consideration. endTok	161.97282427857053
startTok How decisions are made is all-important. endTok	73.4610835664199
startTok co-president of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly. Mr President, I thank the Council and the Commission for their statements this morning, but I will concentrate on coherence policy because that is what the agenda says we are talking about. endTok	35.19151781218835
startTok Much as I agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different Union policies and development policy, I question whether today is the time to be holding it. endTok	67.05719434971145
startTok However, the Council statement gave me hope for the future. endTok	55.48712164453126
startTok It is quite obvious to me, as someone who specialises in development policy, that there are many areas where lack of coherence is dramatically affecting developing nations. endTok	57.444370663689256
startTok I will give some examples shortly. endTok	57.21771515295782
startTok However, I remind this House that, back in June 1997, a Council resolution acknowledged the fact that there is a serious lack of coherence in some of the EU policies in relation to its development cooperation policy. endTok	47.546714654653165
startTok This was followed by a request from the Council to the Commission to provide an annual report, the first of which was to be discussed in 1998. endTok	28.740221465262515
startTok We still await the first report, and that is why I believe this debate was premature, as the Commission had little to say on coherence this morning. endTok	45.23813526132727
startTok The areas identified by the Council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important, such as peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution, food security, fisheries and immigration. endTok	158.6730655520803
startTok Some of these issues have been discussed in depth. endTok	27.879484935184202
startTok I personally feel that issues such as peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution are very much the domain of African Heads of State, with capacity support from the European Union and the OAU acting as arbiter. endTok	72.47894517080213
startTok The issues that are really affected by lack of coherence are in areas such agriculture, trade, environment and biodiversity, but herein lies the real problem: these are the highly sensitive areas of policy within the European Union as a whole and in this Parliament in particular. endTok	78.5725009951069
startTok Members of this House will have differing views, even within the same political parties, depending on (a) which country they come from or (b) which committee they sit on. endTok	123.79233240258188
startTok There are areas of coherence I would like to see as a member of the Committee on Development that would probably horrify some of the members of the Committee on Agriculture or Committee on Fisheries. endTok	29.691365095816955
startTok As a lack of coherence, one can cite as Mrs Sandbæk did, the exporting of milk products to Jamaica at prices far below production costs there which has almost ruined the Jamaican dairy industry. endTok	81.69292926387715
startTok We have beef exported to southern Africa, to Namibia and South Africa, which then sell their indigenous beef to Swaziland, so that Swaziland can fill its export quota back to the European Union. endTok	79.65376954266748
startTok Remember too, some countries blocked an agreement with South African trade for four years. endTok	273.86835464099204
startTok If we simply import raw materials from these developing countries, rather than allowing them the add-on value of producing their finished articles in their own country, we deny them the very poverty-eradication that we have set as our top principle in helping developing nations. endTok	173.44688102943786
startTok I am not surprised the Commission is having trouble producing a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development. endTok	45.128858211432465
startTok There is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment. endTok	154.6774929226815
startTok I wish the Commission well in its task of producing that basic document. endTok	163.93330169720988
startTok Mr President, this morning' s debate is very important. endTok	10.968323371659926
startTok I therefore thank the Commission and the Council for having made a statement on the coherence of Community policies in relation to development, because this demonstrates a will to make policy in this area more effective. endTok	41.5764266861987
startTok However, if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the incoherences in our policy, we will end up totally frustrated and, furthermore, the result will be negative. endTok	45.31406490623349
startTok As with the systems of forces which are studied in basic physics, it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out. endTok	77.90749456523638
startTok The result of this absurd game is not zero, but rather a minus number, as a consequence of the material, financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise. endTok	68.3156730270894
startTok With regard to policy, this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure cancels out the intended effect of another. endTok	104.86789108784781
startTok In today' s globalised world, this fact is all the more obvious. endTok	91.3555960653862
startTok There are no boundaries for Community policies. endTok	36.60868583288673
startTok I am therefore glad that the Commission and the Council are once again taking an interest in the coherence of Community policies, and that, together with complementarity between national and Community policies and coordination between the services of the Commission, they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the European Union. endTok	32.38654791591951
startTok Both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council state, in their respective working programmes, that they wish to give coherence to those policies which have a very important impact on the developing countries, but they do not specify concrete measures aimed at introducing this coherence. endTok	47.511631286152685
startTok Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied. endTok	69.88359576656241
startTok For example, the Commission, in its long term guidelines, says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity, supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account. endTok	48.824301869086355
startTok The Commission is addressing a very important area, that is, commercial policy. endTok	30.29070045530594
startTok However, this Parliament wishes to add policies to aid development, agriculture, fisheries policy, immigration, our position in international financial institutions, the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform. endTok	127.07531831421991
startTok The Council - and Mr Luis Amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time, it is true, being in November 1999, and also on other occasions, such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997 - but with no concrete results. endTok	65.92294606221265
startTok Since the Development Council is in agreement with what he says - and this is very significant - there is little we can say, as some previous speakers have pointed out. endTok	56.1313089399202
startTok However, as Parliament, we wish to propose - as others have said and as the resolution states - the creation of an inter-service working group consisting of the people responsible for all the policies mentioned and the establishment of a monitoring centre for the coherence of the different Community policies, which is capable of anticipating the effects of each policy on the developing countries and amongst themselves. endTok	51.16435491593284
startTok What we really want, however, is to be realists and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination, complementarity and, the most complex one, which we are discussing at the moment, coherence, will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the European Union. endTok	51.003636034267615
startTok Let us hope - and we do hope - to be guided by the winds of change created by the Intergovernmental Conference, the reform of the Commission - which will also affect the development services -, this new legislature and the prospects for enlargement, to perfect a more coherent political union. endTok	56.18288295992327
startTok We therefore hope that the Commission, in the report it is going to present to us on global policy, will also address the question of coherence as an integral element in the efficient use of Community resources and the specific management of public interests. endTok	42.604141040307965
startTok Mr President, I too should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their reports and, in common with others, express my regret at the fact that coherence policy has not been given more prominence. endTok	25.878610463096113
startTok But we who sit here in Parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is. endTok	144.68449749359888
startTok I should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of, in my view, useful figures. endTok	52.538033826466254
startTok At the beginning of the nineteenth century, real per capita income in the world' s richest countries was three times higher than in the poorest countries. In 1900 it was ten times higher and in the year 2000 it is 60 times higher. endTok	45.29555112185938
startTok And there is no sign of this trend' s being reversed. endTok	52.550912177195116
startTok On the contrary, it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further. This is shown by the following figures: the income gap between the richest and poorest fifths was 30:1 in 1960, 60:1 in 1990 and 74:1 in 1997. endTok	88.01960436109893
startTok These figures are from before the Internet revolution took off. endTok	252.18436498317226
startTok In other words, there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich countries, including the EU countries, are not to surround themselves with barriers to prevent immigration on a massive scale. endTok	39.07040281570001
startTok In a global village, major discrepancies in the world will not, in the longer term, be tolerated by the poorest section of the village. endTok	61.67999734925412
startTok At some time or another, there will be a revolt, and it will be fully justified. endTok	45.52185234556444
startTok I would therefore urge the Council' s Presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and, above all, to conclude it in such a way that we all of us, including the people of Europe, realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide. endTok	46.80383514076954
startTok The EU on average is far from providing the pledged 0.7%. endTok	78.10154314397508
startTok It may well be that others are worse, but that does not place us in any better a light. endTok	98.94568998403987
startTok Above all, however, we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us. endTok	81.59964823962618
startTok As far as I could hear - but I may have missed something - the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention the word "trade" at all. endTok	45.86708366612568
startTok I would just say to the Commissioner that I hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the Commission and the Member States. I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up, not only in the Commission but also in the Member States. endTok	28.30898444786202
startTok I should also like to say that, in my view, what would be most effective would be for Parliament to call for proposals from, respectively, the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development. In that way, we should perhaps have a basis for discussion, instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the Commission, which is scarcely likely to produce results. endTok	56.920960446376654
startTok I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution. endTok	31.320781298418215
startTok As Commissioner Liikanen keeps saying on his travels, we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunications. endTok	61.05842472697964
startTok Let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries. endTok	28.975766609561617
startTok This technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and, in this connection, the EU can set the agenda, leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities. endTok	161.5226323608111
startTok Mr President, "The EU' s development cooperation leaves a great deal to be desired" . endTok	22.4441094493029
startTok This is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week, commenting on the Union' s development policy. endTok	52.90013876355283
startTok This is not new. endTok	27.661173066902656
startTok Ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation, its effectiveness and quality have been called into question. endTok	88.24300531899924
startTok Hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the Commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror. endTok	41.003634823665536
startTok Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally? endTok	49.93755262197903
startTok One of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy' s internal conflict. endTok	94.85297960401324
startTok In terms of trade and agriculture, in particular, the European policy is in conflict with the development policy. endTok	36.15859592551134
startTok We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries. endTok	23.821663731670597
startTok This has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation. endTok	66.24246382854436
startTok We should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations, but as a policy in its own right. endTok	95.91530814249691
startTok I advocate transparent, joint and efficient development policy. endTok	265.91396009192306
startTok As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money, it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States. endTok	61.962136366314034
startTok Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible, so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way. endTok	27.45709088129871
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense. endTok	20.673667880492
startTok As various Members have already commented, we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies, whose objectives run counter to development in those countries. endTok	72.03369110978954
startTok And we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies, tourism, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and industry. endTok	91.25054202957695
startTok We are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies. endTok	53.43158966160917
startTok So there is a whole raft of contradictions. endTok	26.509597263329304
startTok In my opinion, these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies. They are, if anything, more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States. endTok	63.100768724896994
startTok We have to be aware of this. endTok	12.722488817953773
startTok We often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world, as was recently the case with Indonesia, when we protested at the top of our voices only to discover subsequently that some European countries had been supplying them with arms and military equipment. endTok	75.80697650144286
startTok For me, these are the most serious contradictions in all this, more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies. endTok	74.79458027793217
startTok We obviously know that, even within any one country, there are always contradictions between various policies. endTok	82.52719696280866
startTok That is a fact of life. endTok	43.74494671377909
startTok And we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies, in this case development policy. endTok	23.02660036927804
startTok We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them. The underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one. endTok	54.26814965765004
startTok I believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between Community policies and development and cooperation policy, and that this monitoring centre' s sphere of activity should not be limited just to Community policies, but should also cover Member States' actions and policies, including the actions of economic groups, which I think are also important. endTok	68.5159467110496
startTok This monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on developments in these policies and on their impact and interaction. endTok	68.89640687427891
startTok I have left to the end a question that I regard as fundamental and which I think needs to be noted and approved by this House. endTok	54.40338324424465
startTok Our objective of minimising contradictions between development and cooperation policy and other policies has to be a valid objective, not merely within the European Union, but also at world level, given the increasing globalisation of the economy. endTok	56.27860501896579
startTok If we want fair world trade we will have to gain acceptance for this principle during the next WTO round of multilateral negotiations, because it would be contradictory if the European Union imposed a rigid but fair discipline on itself, only for the United States and the other major powers to do the opposite and to take advantage of our restraint. endTok	73.65469820344153
startTok That is why I consider it to be essential - and fair - for these principles to be established at the next WTO round. endTok	30.954849896791472
startTok Mr President, the Director-General of the DG for Development has said that to produce a report on coherence of EU policies with development policies, before this spring' s paper on development policy itself, is like putting the cart before the horse. endTok	63.2893154229607
startTok Never mind that the Commission' s requirement to produce an annual report, set out clearly in the Council resolution, has produced only one "non-paper" , the real problem here is that at the time of rising world poverty this particular horse is climbing uphill and the cart of other EU policies is so heavy that development policy is actually being pulled slowly backwards. endTok	106.5179994833689
startTok Time after time development policy is forgotten or is an afterthought when the major policies of this European Union are considered. endTok	111.67819441601921
startTok Take the new chocolate directive, which shows that EU countries spend more on chocolate every year than on development aid. endTok	104.54884604129414
startTok There has been no proper development assessment of this directive which the producer countries, 90% of which are our ACP partners, estimate could cut incomes to cacao farmers by at least 15%. endTok	107.68930120025679
startTok Take the fishing agreements, where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the EU waters. endTok	79.08169966781779
startTok We are, at the same time, negotiating joint ventures allowing increased access for Europe' s large-scale fishing vessels in developing country waters at the expense of 190 million small-scale fish workers in those countries world-wide. endTok	98.05671312997843
startTok Take the trade agreements. endTok	165.68396517050957
startTok As Mr Nielson said this morning with regard to Lomé, preferential access is only for "essentially all the products of the least-developed countries" . endTok	52.76888091734389
startTok In other words, when EU commercial interests are concerned, poverty considerations go out of the window. endTok	129.0482157465778
startTok In the stance that we took at Seattle, why such a silence on the EU' s failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed in the GATT, including for the crucial textile sector? endTok	80.25940246584626
startTok On the common agricultural policy, the biggest culprit - no development impact assessment of the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms. endTok	92.24837193828371
startTok Everyone now knows of the scandal of the export refund scheme which dumped 54 000 tonnes of excess subsidised beef on West African markets, slashing prices for local cattle farmers by half. endTok	156.4604897410635
startTok Today beef stocks stand at 300 000 tonnes. endTok	129.98558171152933
startTok Who will be next, quite literally, for the chop? endTok	62.87367699470142
startTok I welcome Mr Amadeus' statement this morning, which acknowledged the difficulties of non-budgetisation of the EDF, which called for a more active role for the Development Council and which called for development priorities to be central to the EU' s emerging common foreign and security policy. endTok	40.824704679448466
startTok I welcome too the Council declaration of 1992, its resolution of 1997 and successive changes in the Treaty of European Union. endTok	78.17986447960615
startTok Action simply has not been taken. endTok	41.647828856878526
startTok That is why we want annual reports, we want an annual inter-service group and we want a complaints procedure, to make sure action is actually taken. endTok	101.66529354674344
startTok I ask Mr Nielson, in his summing-up, to directly address those points in the resolution. endTok	80.44964142568887
startTok Mr President, I would like to restrict my contribution to the link between development cooperation and agriculture. endTok	21.99851709156938
startTok Over the past couple of years, a considerable share of the funds has been channelled towards the development of agriculture and cattle breeding in the developing countries and, more especially, the Lomé countries. endTok	40.2915383900575
startTok The results are certainly not what we expected. endTok	59.958732859677895
startTok What could be the cause of this? endTok	45.48995495537657
startTok I think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries, barring a few exceptions. endTok	49.52010741666157
startTok I think that the Commission could do a great deal there to help this develop. endTok	38.70019692079892
startTok No farmer, anywhere in the world, will produce something if prices are too low. endTok	76.8494546304139
startTok The governments in the developing countries are always faced with a difficult dilemma: whom should they support, the farmers or the people in the large cities who want cheap food? endTok	89.20896855113001
startTok This fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the Commission, and not by the Commission on its own. In most countries where the Commission is active, development aid is also granted by the Member States themselves. endTok	38.66045885741232
startTok It should not be the case that the policy of the Member States contravenes that of the Commission. endTok	16.303809035239905
startTok It is up to the Commission' s delegations in the developing countries to assume a leading role in the development of this political dialogue and to ensure that all countries follow this line of approach. endTok	38.47432114295016
startTok Special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production. endTok	55.99011148984522
startTok Far too often, artificial fertiliser, veterinary medication and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge. endTok	76.23253918185438
startTok Once the project comes to an end after five years, the policy of free gifts also ends. endTok	97.98272459333893
startTok I think, therefore, that the cost element should be built in right from the outset in the policy of all projects, and as far as I know, this is not the case by any stretch of the imagination. endTok	36.423463725654486
startTok Finally, I wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use. endTok	45.41338410573248
startTok Every year, I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund, that they are far behind in spending the funds. endTok	64.7089153237142
startTok Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are in actual fact holding a debate amongst the converted, which is a pity. endTok	16.937514493781354
startTok We should really talk about coherence in the development policy in the presence of Mr Prodi, for example, who has missed a great chance right from the outset, for he has allowed the development cooperation policy to fragment over three Commissioners - and this is better than four, I have to admit - but this does not really make for a coherent policy. endTok	72.61763135047121
startTok We also note that, as before, there are still various DGs which stifle this policy with often very conflicting procedures and arguments. endTok	105.34210650549764
startTok The President-in-Office of the Council came up with a good suggestion, namely to budget the European Development Fund. endTok	39.75413047507346
startTok Parliament would, of course, welcome this with open arms. If this were possible, it would be a huge, historic victory. endTok	70.4067843462262
startTok Since Amsterdam, three terms have taken centre stage: complementarity, coordination and cohesion. endTok	628.810546422745
startTok I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields. endTok	22.11648485987991
startTok If a request is made for a report on the progress made on cohesion, if a request is made at all, then drafting such a report cannot be very difficult, unless one simply admits that there is no cohesion at all. endTok	58.518927131239145
startTok I would prefer it if a report were to be written on the present lack of cohesion, and if a systematic strategy were to be developed to reach a certain level of cohesion, for it is a long way off yet. endTok	73.32823385004814
startTok One thing shocked me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council. endTok	22.615799783248082
startTok He stated: "Contradictions in policy can lead to balance." endTok	154.86118053039596
startTok It is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand, and vice versa. endTok	50.36902351314555
startTok But this leads to status-quo and self-deceit, and globalisation as a whole has so far only led to changes, indeed, but changes which have only made poverty worse. endTok	126.82071436669825
startTok This is supposed to be our priority, would you believe. endTok	66.93694703030822
startTok I know that we do a great deal of good, but let us start with this very essential aspect. endTok	36.231152993989426
startTok Mr President, we have already noted that there is no report from the Commission, but I intend to discuss three matters in the light of the objectives which the Council presented in its 1997 opinion. endTok	28.645420337273446
startTok The first is concerned with conflict resolution. endTok	55.27978570180324
startTok For many years, I have tried, through the Council and the Commission, to find out why none of the institutions is actively participating in, and working for, conflict resolution in the Western Sahara, which is occupied by Morocco. endTok	52.793684056522004
startTok The UN has a peace plan. endTok	56.650402348945455
startTok We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end. endTok	46.22323084676388
startTok I also want to take up the subject of migration. endTok	26.928520035248265
startTok I am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the ACP countries, which might make it easier to expel immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees on flimsier grounds. endTok	39.49438177284819
startTok I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms. endTok	33.917756094234676
startTok We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds. endTok	35.155751320656144
startTok Three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age. endTok	80.12189907576436
startTok This is not because of a lack of food, but because of what we have talked a lot about today, namely increasing poverty. endTok	58.30643426015021
startTok Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests. endTok	88.37088739393484
startTok I believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply, specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason. endTok	88.32513680504287
startTok I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce. endTok	27.115029471242483
startTok Women appear to be completely absent from all areas, especially development policy when, of course, we are not in reality absent at all. endTok	79.08381140521678
startTok Mr President, the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid. endTok	60.69661253657911
startTok The level of aid is naturally important, and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased. endTok	37.248436758200924
startTok This ought to be done with, in particular, a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity. endTok	37.778794798346105
startTok However, the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries. endTok	68.3895941152271
startTok A number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed. endTok	78.08232878147133
startTok The latter include trade, agricultural and fisheries policies. endTok	113.51462535818443
startTok Other important areas are, of course, the flow of private investments, cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deals with, and finances solutions to, a variety of global problems which affect us all. endTok	75.51377357746318
startTok These problems include questions of climate, health issues, biodiversity etc, and the problems are clearly exacerbated by globalisation, that is to say the new economy which is developing. endTok	76.17901368438392
startTok In this economy, the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked. endTok	89.12559022560102
startTok In my opinion, what we are discussing here today is partly the EU' s contribution to the debate about the opportunities and risks of globalisation and about the rules there must be in order to give poor countries a decent chance. endTok	48.279636568477564
startTok The report, or survey, which Mrs Maij-Weggen has demanded, showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be, is naturally quite crucial. endTok	132.07550113111904
startTok I cannot help but wonder why the Commission has not done more. endTok	44.15288253806513
startTok The Commission is new and has to be given time, but the absence of such a survey suggests that there are powerful tensions within the Commission. endTok	46.17190394201095
startTok I can only hope that Mr Nielsen will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the Commission. endTok	28.748904517571834
startTok In addition to a report of this kind, I should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character. endTok	26.984447129705767
startTok An analysis of this kind should look not only at the flow of aid but also give comprehensive consideration to all the different types of aid and transfers of resources which influence poor countries. These include technology, trade, cooperation in the field of research etc. endTok	78.92536166976903
startTok It should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we are conducting. endTok	24.22708906011746
startTok Finally, Parliament recommends, in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution, that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence. endTok	41.295515401761655
startTok I believe it is only a coincidence, but the Commissioner for the Environment is also, of course, to participate in this group. endTok	32.991530197564515
startTok Let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed. endTok	23.669271747976996
startTok Policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other. endTok	80.37812925762555
startTok There are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest. endTok	33.19111244479527
startTok Mr President, the Seattle demonstrators argued that free trade is bad for the less- and least-developed countries, it is purely a rich country selfish interest. endTok	66.15480514614578
startTok Yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminating poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania over the 40 or 50 years since they became independent. endTok	72.05031762515853
startTok There the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs, allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain. endTok	133.65639027453545
startTok It did not work; poverty became worse than ever. endTok	110.7540643959012
startTok The medicine may not taste too good in the short term, but opening one' s economy to competition at home and abroad forces optimal application of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the not so longer term. endTok	91.98842115312853
startTok Is that not the lesson of the European Union itself and of the single market in particular? endTok	28.345549227469096
startTok As Mr Nielson said, this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity. endTok	38.11975023831799
startTok Yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough. endTok	34.47824352525738
startTok We also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for imports from these countries. Parliament' s resolution on the WTO negotiations advocated a free import policy by the EU. endTok	58.111197849872205
startTok Eliminating all remaining barriers to imports, tariff barriers and quotas and, just as important, non-tariff barriers, such as Mrs Maij-Weggen mentioned in her speech - eliminating these barriers would do more than any amount of development aid to secure for developing countries the economic progress which both we and they desire. endTok	170.44439895876792
startTok It is quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy diminishes our development efforts and must also diminish the political regard of the developing countries for Europe and our fine words. endTok	71.10677123138252
startTok Mr President, in the last couple of days we have heard fine words about the need for greater coherence, coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programmes of the Community and of the Member States. endTok	29.42063280274329
startTok There is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union' s ability to match words with action. endTok	66.30354939254187
startTok I am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti-personnel landmines which present an obstacle to so many development programmes, to post-conflict reconstruction, and which ruin the lives of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poorest parts of the world, particularly in developing countries. endTok	44.53923589868688
startTok Over recent years the Community has spent some EUR 200 million in mine clearance, assistance to victims and related activities. endTok	68.1967784836136
startTok The Member States have spent similar amounts. endTok	83.7893660579406
startTok But there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti-personnel landmine problem within a finite time span. endTok	60.75157007777499
startTok Mr Nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with Member States. endTok	46.395514643759924
startTok This has been talked about for years. endTok	26.845000262649183
startTok The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes, strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions, ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell. endTok	110.16803783601506
startTok It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes. endTok	103.33042091604682
startTok A proper stock-taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines. endTok	119.34525188154727
startTok It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational, procedural, financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union. endTok	40.3027216183175
startTok Are these afflictions of the past, or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations? endTok	58.59303122478949
startTok Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new ACP-EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence. endTok	40.03396665056169
startTok And it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights, democracy, rule of law, and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously, and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent, rather, we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect. endTok	144.29983329998157
startTok For these are prerequisite to any development. endTok	115.64084623073269
startTok If these criteria are not adhered to, then development does not stand a chance endTok	73.0207979982819
startTok The same goes for Cuba, Mr Modrow. endTok	91.25019393704771
startTok I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process. But for this to happen, there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba. endTok	46.23823214972548
startTok After all, we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International. endTok	35.76874715871672
startTok It may well be that you, having belonged to one of the last Communist dictatorships, view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this Chamber, and that you have problems where good governance is concerned. endTok	72.61150266816634
startTok Nonetheless, these are important criteria for the European Union. endTok	29.450199423965536
startTok There is a second issue I would like to raise. endTok	18.13296049724473
startTok We are discussing coherence here. endTok	81.73528348123402
startTok Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent. endTok	38.03207490502475
startTok In my view, however, the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too. endTok	35.46058651401862
startTok There is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another. endTok	21.935548490723537
startTok Nor is there coherence vis-à-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union' s budget but the EDF remains outside it. endTok	77.20429554045194
startTok Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if in future you succeed in making this EUR 13.5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control, and to bodies such as OLAF, then I believe you will raise the level of acceptability. endTok	42.717019564127696
startTok This, to my mind, is also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do, i.e. establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union. endTok	38.81251189800511
startTok Mr President, we certainly must concede that, on balance, this text is full of good intentions, but we did not vote in favour of it in committee, nor shall we do so in plenary. We had two reasons for this, both of which gave rise to amendments which I should like to explain here very briefly. endTok	56.91870770254713
startTok First, the Committee on Development and Cooperation advocates the communitisation of the EDF; clearly that is misguided. endTok	60.868541899664955
startTok In our view, cooperation is, and should remain, an intergovernmental exercise. endTok	85.16325526228704
startTok With Europe preparing to enlarge, communitising the EDF would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget, quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy. endTok	72.32193362879693
startTok Lastly, the Commission has, in the recent past, had trouble managing the funds for development and humanitarian aid transparently, as Mrs Maes has just reminded us so opportunely. endTok	53.738729366534024
startTok Why should we add to them? endTok	36.69427836600018
startTok Secondly, we find it most regrettable that Mr Corrie' s report should mention the trade and development agreement with South Africa because, in the final analysis, this report is typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the European Commission is taking ever more frequent recourse. endTok	59.703022572259684
startTok It is perfectly astounding that the Union could have negotiated an agreement on behalf of the Member States in which a fundamental section is quite simply left blank. endTok	44.253887390638745
startTok And let me say in passing, it is even more astonishing that the Council allowed it to. endTok	50.68998320088977
startTok As a result, we are now in the absurd position of negotiating from a position of weakness on vital aspects such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already signed. endTok	62.08898818433853
startTok The part of this agreement which blocks negotiations could mean that the Union ends up paying producers to stop producing sherry, port and a whole host of products which are purely and simply copies under international commercial law. Imagine the potential cost of such a precedent. endTok	131.89286389903467
startTok It is proof, as if we still needed it, of the fact that immature diplomacy, which defends no interests, unless of course they are individual interests, and is caught between the dogma of free trade and pressure groups and more or less friendly NGOs, is not just inefficient, it is positively dangerous. endTok	83.29027619428821
startTok Finally, a word on the general thinking behind the Corrie report. endTok	81.3816174682851
startTok Nowadays, let us face it, the Joint Assembly is seen as an obstacle to free international trade by the dogmatisers in Geneva and Washington. endTok	69.14070208751285
startTok It was a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern countries should be developed and strengthened. endTok	58.58104647614981
startTok The Corrie report missed this chance and we must, regrettably, punish it for losing so much. endTok	76.53948118781375
startTok . (PT) Mr President, by way of both a conclusion and a summary, I would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate. endTok	39.55890710872846
startTok First of all, many speakers stressed that globalisation accentuates regional imbalances and social inequality, and increases poverty. endTok	81.1589833512211
startTok This suggests that something must be done, failing which tensions will be aggravated and conflicts jeopardising international peace and stability will arise or worsen. endTok	91.54851662967755
startTok Secondly, it will be important to approach development policies from a different angle in this context, taking advantage of their capacity for correcting imbalances and reducing inequality. endTok	76.80058617750097
startTok I believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the European Union' s role in international development policies is significant. endTok	27.764265513331626
startTok Everyone recognises, indeed this was the theme of today' s debate, that, if the European Union is to play a more active and leading role in development policies at world level, it will have no choice but to enhance the coherence of its own various development-related policies. I note that some speakers also emphasised that responsibility for coherence in EU policies is not a matter for the Council, for the Commission or for Parliament alone. endTok	64.97943499307608
startTok Quite the contrary - it will have to be the subject of a concerted effort in terms of discussion and legislative and institutional preparation, be it on the part of the Commission or of the Council, or even on the part of the European Parliament itself, and some Members have in fact already suggested that a monitoring centre or a working party could be established to monitor the impact of various policies in the specific area of development. endTok	49.87243335835843
startTok Finally, I would like to emphasise that it is also important - and this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency' s programme - to note the view that it is necessary to recognise the value of development in the European Union' s policies, and in particular in the context of its foreign policy. endTok	18.799580443746645
startTok We believe that this is absolutely vital, failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies, and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning Europe' s status in the international system. endTok	62.10900529393869
startTok For this reason it may be necessary, as I have stressed, to change the model and move away from the post-colonial model towards a more European approach to development policies. endTok	51.216383697243884
startTok In this respect I believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention, which succeeds the Lomé Convention, is an important instrument of renewal, and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process, as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in Seattle. endTok	56.22434251314627
startTok . I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate. endTok	73.73007192560517
startTok I have given you a statement on behalf of the Commission which I think provides a useful background to this discussion. endTok	35.104935796267156
startTok We will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence. endTok	171.20478491683673
startTok This discussion is not new. endTok	44.215698891184495
startTok We are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it, as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence. endTok	48.87639813937571
startTok I have no doubt that as a result of the increasing political attention attached to these problems - something which has clearly been reflected in the debate today - it will be easier for the Commission and the DG on Development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda. endTok	51.63966925483089
startTok This also calls for the introduction of further new mechanisms in the Commission system which may very well include, as suggested by some of the political groups in Parliament, the setting up of a special intra-service working group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the Commission. endTok	52.42564528649648
startTok I have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything. endTok	53.89148945794188
startTok I think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist, and we certainly do have them. endTok	67.02922174391561
startTok Much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every Member State, as has been very honestly said here in this House: people more or less identify with their spheres of interest, and all this is legitimate. endTok	106.14396705522492
startTok I would, however, warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system. endTok	32.500548360447674
startTok This exists, but it is only a small part of what we are discussing. endTok	36.943898706186516
startTok The major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on, and this is the problem. endTok	79.01106439194513
startTok Mr Mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low. endTok	73.20969140011697
startTok This is true in our part of the world, but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective. endTok	60.55360322222884
startTok They farm, not just for a living, but in order to live, and this makes a difference. endTok	65.5202788464902
startTok Subsistence farming is not based on price calculations, it is based on the hope of rain in the next season. endTok	30.604808026310806
startTok This does not apply to all farming in developing countries but to the poverty-focusing which we need to deliver better than so far. endTok	42.67262790593252
startTok From that perspective, what I am saying here is of deep relevance. endTok	91.43290729166338
startTok Other issues have been mentioned: cattle-farming in Namibia, tomatoes and milk powder in the Caribbean. endTok	26.007294989729647
startTok We should not be too masochistic. endTok	23.885775159320215
startTok There is a limit to how useful that is. endTok	83.69397057684259
startTok All these cases are characterised by the fact that they have been taken care of. endTok	31.368587062099902
startTok The intervention prices have been regulated, and the problems we had with beef in Western Africa and in Namibia were actually solved by reducing the intervention support. endTok	176.24305430995037
startTok These are real problems, but they have all been dealt with. endTok	40.3324818095766
startTok As regards the issue of cacao, chocolate: I repeat that the 5% has to do with creating a basis for a living in the neighbouring countries. endTok	31.82211370146163
startTok What we are talking about here are the local nuts which are as important to the people collecting them and making a living out of them in Burkina Faso as coconuts for farmers in Ghana. endTok	46.39794824917238
startTok This is not a clear case of incoherence, it is more a case of a competition between suppliers. endTok	42.26457120262151
startTok What was mentioned concerning sugar in the Caribbean is more complicated. endTok	134.804395594366
startTok In the Overseas Countries and Territories Framework the accumulation of some of these trade aspects represents a complicated problem, but it may be that what we are talking about here has more to do with promoting the interests of some European companies than with generating income in the Caribbean. In any case, this is a matter which we are currently dealing with. endTok	80.45113753335757
startTok I am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and I would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with South Africa. endTok	33.47170530732238
startTok In all modesty, I would claim that this is something that documents that the Commission is willing to walk or fly the extra mile in order to ensure coherence between the perspective of development cooperation and the perspective of trade interests. endTok	56.88587661943787
startTok We certainly have done our share to solve that problem, and I sincerely hope that we now will have a soft landing and a peaceful implementation in the forthcoming years of that agreement. endTok	67.91335025662767
startTok Finally, I thank you again for this debate. endTok	26.98215043455458
startTok We will come back again with material on these issues, because these problems, in one way or another, are here to stay, simply because development cooperation represents basically doing something in the world that is different from taking care of traditionally-defined trade interests, etc. We have to reconcile those different approaches. endTok	144.53327943048322
startTok Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson. endTok	5.005636560026837
startTok I have received eight motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure. endTok	20.806743236278873
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m. endTok	5.325701709630239
startTok Next session of UN Human Rights Commission endTok	127.33541220164115
startTok The next item is the statement by the Council on EU priorities for the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission on 20 March 2000. endTok	21.274621977885424
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union played an active role in the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held in Geneva in March and April 1999. endTok	17.56571786429189
startTok It tabled resolutions on the human rights situation in Iran, Iraq, in the Israeli settlements, in Burma/Myanmar, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Sudan, and negotiated statements to be issued on behalf of the chairman on Colombia and on East Timor. endTok	54.29335977792019
startTok For the first time, the European Union tabled a resolution on the death penalty, which was enormously successful, and led work on a resolution concerning children' s rights, which was a joint initiative with the Latin American group of countries. endTok	70.6949214078043
startTok The Union will continue to play this role at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission to be held in Geneva in March and April. endTok	28.989123549198528
startTok In particular, as agreed at the Human Rights Council Group on 9 February 2000, the European Union intends to table draft resolutions on the Israeli settlements, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burma/Myanmar, a draft chairman' s statement on Colombia, and, possibly, on East Timor, together with a draft statement on the situation in various countries. endTok	62.430961894119164
startTok The European Union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission at the next meeting of the Human Rights Group in March. endTok	28.572436745865158
startTok In particular, there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty. endTok	29.345548165950106
startTok To date, the group has not reached agreement on the strategy to be adopted in this respect, and in particular with regard to formulating a compromise to be tabled in the last resort in case of any amendments to the contrary, including Article 2(7) of the Charter of the United Nations, which refers to sovereignty. endTok	53.567905840619844
startTok We have tried to reach agreement in advance on a compromise text, in view of the difficulties that arose at the 1999 session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, at which the Member States failed to agree on an amendment introducing a reference to Article 2(7) into the draft resolution sponsored by the European Union on the death penalty. endTok	41.34829207418044
startTok As you know, at the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held last year, the United States decided, at a very late stage, to table a draft resolution on China. endTok	41.435214345024136
startTok This draft resolution was defeated by a Chinese no-action motion. endTok	131.01556632312622
startTok The European Union voted against that motion. endTok	73.34781721551441
startTok The European Union' s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999: there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co-sponsor a resolution on China, but an EU vote against the no-action motion. endTok	110.90520876287646
startTok It is by no means certain that the European Union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote. endTok	50.03253397650747
startTok The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution. endTok	37.83746796027221
startTok This initiative has provoked a strong reaction on China' s part: the Chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the European Union, in an attempt to persuade them not to support the United States' initiative. endTok	48.90613408984895
startTok This initiative is being discussed within the Union, but with no hope of a decision in the near future. endTok	43.852127299520006
startTok It is in the interests of the European Union to keep all its options open for as long as possible, and in any case at least until after the EU-China human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 February 2000. endTok	52.65419078367838
startTok In view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission, we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close. endTok	62.856200789286646
startTok It is therefore important this year, too, that the countries of the European Union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution. endTok	31.725821541111085
startTok In this context it is important to note that the European Union regularly opposes requests by China that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. endTok	55.37320337998043
startTok The European Union unequivocally considers that although it is a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and for taking note of the overall position of the other party, the dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground, and when this does not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the Human Rights Commission, potentially whilst the dialogue is continuing. endTok	51.0049128727651
startTok The European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues, and whether or not it agrees with this initiative, this is in any case legitimate from this point of view. endTok	62.73579814965398
startTok The next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon, and will include seminars on legal issues and on women' s rights, and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part. endTok	60.12911686478753
startTok The next human rights seminar will be organised by the Portuguese Presidency in May 2000, and, during the last round of the dialogue in October 1999, the Chinese side accepted the European Union' s proposal for technical assistance to support the process of ratifying the United Nations International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the United Nations' International Pact on Civil and Political Rights, both of which have been signed by the Chinese Government. endTok	53.02795539877349
startTok The European Union is discussing issues on which it hopes that China will take concrete measures, and on the basis of these discussions the presidency will convey to the Chinese authorities the message that the European Union hopes China will announce positive measures at the session on 25 February. endTok	68.72699872355476
startTok The presidency will also present to the Chinese authorities a list of individual cases on which it intends to express its serious concern. endTok	63.5356594578504
startTok The meeting held in Beijing in October 1999 confirmed that, on the one hand, the Chinese authorities were willing to make concessions on issues relating to the dialogue itself, with a restructuring of the dialogue and of discussion of legal forms of repression such as the death penalty and administrative detention. On the other hand, they will not give any ground on the pivotal questions of the single party system and territorial integrity. endTok	67.17294902754196
startTok Discussions within the European Union about the situation in China following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the European Union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in China more firmly; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue, while recognising the positive steps that China has made on the international stage. endTok	76.64221576521265
startTok On various occasions the European Union has reiterated to the Chinese authorities its disappointment with the results of the dialogue, and has stressed that it hoped for better outcomes in certain more sensitive areas. endTok	55.9934755597753
startTok It was decided that the dialogue should continue, but in a more targeted and effective way, given that China has agreed with the European Union' s proposal to restructure the dialogue by means of better use of experts and to establish a closer link with the seminars. endTok	46.153611871947
startTok Lastly, during the next Human Rights Commission there will also be a debate on rationalising the work of the Commission itself. endTok	29.39570708493847
startTok A working party has been set up with the express task of revising the Commission' s mechanisms. This working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous, especially in the financial field. endTok	46.24859592140523
startTok The European Union will oppose any spurious attempt to use this reform of the Human Rights Commission' s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level. endTok	74.64002612748317
startTok . Mr President, I would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for Geneva on subjects like racism, civil and political rights and the right to development. endTok	43.1139613649505
startTok As the presidency said, much remains to be done, despite the understandable request by Parliament and many NGOs that the European Union should set out its position well in advance of the Geneva session. endTok	65.27713332152622
startTok That is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the toughest issues. endTok	83.26502071256326
startTok For example, discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in Parliament' s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases. endTok	83.01225336835331
startTok It is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult. endTok	25.007423383728053
startTok That does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference. endTok	77.44731749176634
startTok However, let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues: the death penalty, Cuba and China. endTok	194.31817981904894
startTok I am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks. endTok	43.26048235570208
startTok We are currently reviewing the options and possibilities for introducing a death penalty resolution in the Human Rights Commission. endTok	50.00505783198731
startTok This has always been a subject about which I personally have felt extremely strongly, I have always voted against the death penalty. endTok	56.68088122810941
startTok Spurred on by Amnesty International and others, one of the first decisions I took as Governor of Hong Kong was to abolish the death penalty. endTok	89.12333783922489
startTok We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly. endTok	111.68357302913539
startTok We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid. endTok	88.3502840584473
startTok The New York stage is different from Geneva. endTok	115.46149871996549
startTok Last year' s debate in New York on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues. endTok	97.53145320384627
startTok It certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty. endTok	31.78597467618013
startTok The debate in Geneva, however, is more focused on human rights issues. endTok	63.681277956122806
startTok We may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there. endTok	77.6260048341957
startTok Secondly, Cuba. endTok	566.1300348223683
startTok I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously. endTok	108.05620622690192
startTok We are extremely concerned about moves by the Cuban Government over the last year that have further curtailed public freedom, moves like changes in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty. endTok	76.67215266681778
startTok We are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions. endTok	27.63500355167602
startTok We are monitoring the human rights situation through the reports of NGOs and the work of our human rights working group based in the EU embassies in Havana. endTok	50.23960191207511
startTok We have regularly put our criticisms to the Cuban authorities, and this Parliament has done the same. endTok	42.60540060365424
startTok But I do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate Cuba. endTok	35.80762153497847
startTok We want a fair and open society in Cuba, a Cuba which respects the principles of the market, the sanctity of contract and the rule of law. endTok	58.14875646093397
startTok We want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. endTok	25.89368184731751
startTok My views are exactly the same when it comes to the third subject with which I wish to deal, namely China. endTok	80.37644287505205
startTok Quite simply, I want us to be engaged with China. endTok	71.80313696612534
startTok It would be self-indulgent and self-defeating, as well as insulting to over a fifth of humanity, to want anything else. endTok	72.89329769677391
startTok I also want to see a China transformed by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not lock up democracy activists or religious believers. endTok	62.99371345585635
startTok So what should we do? endTok	46.192042403027145
startTok Naturally we should trade enthusiastically with China and hope that we can welcome China into the World Trade Organisation on sensible terms. endTok	131.0199395124341
startTok It is a misnomer to talk about a World Trade Organisation which does not include China - or Russia, for that matter. endTok	44.29208775286374
startTok But I do not believe today, nor have I ever believed, that our burgeoning economic relationship with China - manifested, for example, by China' s EUR 25 billion surplus with the European Union - should silence us when it comes to China' s human rights record. endTok	62.75473705064415
startTok For me the question is not whether we should address the question of human rights in China - we have a duty to do so and a legitimate interest in doing so - but rather what is the most effective way of doing this? endTok	43.824555254080295
startTok So what should be our attitude towards a Geneva resolution this year? endTok	84.77773581585181
startTok As the presidency has noted, the Union as a whole is considering its position. endTok	52.662765684437694
startTok But I strongly suggest there are a number of factors of which the Member States ought to take proper account. endTok	28.64573450061527
startTok First, while some people question whether tabling a Geneva resolution makes any difference, several of the most distinguished Chinese advocates of democracy strongly believe that it is a valuable move, not least because of the message it sends to people in China itself. endTok	130.0764790250084
startTok That is a point that deserves serious consideration. endTok	35.41355174141451
startTok Secondly, we will all want to take proper account of what has actually been happening in China in recent months, for instance, the heavy sentences imposed on democracy campaigners, the detention and recent punishments meted out to members of Christian churches and the arrests and sentences of the members of Falun Gong. endTok	38.66563014874788
startTok Chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in Tibet. endTok	76.54652540760613
startTok We have made our views very clear to them. endTok	41.83979233876038
startTok While we all know that for many people in China there has been a real long-term improvement in their economic prospects and their social and economic liberties, there is a dark side to the picture as well. endTok	45.29908263092766
startTok Critics of tabling a resolution say that at least we now have a human rights dialogue with China. endTok	73.68297627448702
startTok That is true and potentially valuable, although I have to say - and I have said to Chinese officials as has the presidency - that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked. endTok	70.54009277948059
startTok Of course the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement EU cooperation programmes in the human rights and legal spheres. endTok	54.09085849565825
startTok That is very welcome and I also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level. endTok	55.18939403247404
startTok Naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human rights is going to be a long-term process, but I wish I could point to more real gains. endTok	90.21845274982479
startTok The next dialogue in Lisbon on 25 February will be an important test. endTok	43.5734455563647
startTok It will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not. endTok	94.48944546926657
startTok What, finally, do we want to see as the first steps? endTok	41.45561934763217
startTok Well, for example, we would like to see China move from signing the UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights toward actually ratifying them. endTok	99.37222634493142
startTok I wish we were closer to that. endTok	70.5735686769156
startTok Where does all that leave us this year? endTok	116.73309383350907
startTok I repeat that Member States will have to make up their minds. endTok	24.728532641133746
startTok What I hope is, first, that we in Europe will adopt a common position and stick to it, that we will not allow some to be picked off, that our position will not be based on self-delusion or pretence, that it will be a common position and a sensible position. endTok	48.45874161604683
startTok I know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions. endTok	72.1815404975912
startTok But if that is true, then at the very least we need to be more imaginative and honest with ourselves in looking for that way forward. endTok	49.47006129819333
startTok If we are to rest our position on the human rights dialogue, then we need to be able to convince you, the NGO community and the public at large that it is actually getting somewhere. endTok	40.5232323625772
startTok That, in my judgement, is the challenge for the next few weeks. endTok	28.83323957249931
startTok I am grateful to the House for its concern about human rights around the world, and particularly in China. endTok	31.862388111361106
startTok Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten. endTok	4.905951670918266
startTok We will now interrupt the debate on the joint statement concerning the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission and proceed to the vote. endTok	26.61869601888868
startTok Welcome endTok	760.5506724104712
startTok I am delighted to welcome a delegation of the Hong Kong Legislative Council to Parliament. endTok	47.15867640321828
startTok (Loud applause) endTok	24.314994226401275
startTok VOTE endTok	281.09893356486054
startTok . As Mrs Wallström explained during yesterday's debate, the Commission is able to accept the following amendments: Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13. endTok	30.936795786658813
startTok The Commission can also accept Amendment No 4 in principle. endTok	18.35399057900588
startTok The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3, 5, 6, 12, 14, 18 and 16. endTok	19.0152984250637

startTok . (DE) Mr President, following this vote, I would like to ask the competent Commissioner, Mr Byrne, if, now that he has seen how much support there is in this Chamber, he is prepared to adopt the proposed amendments? endTok	46.700016424291505
startTok . I regret to say that I believe that the thought-out position I advanced yesterday is the correct position. endTok	68.13839979546322
startTok The comprehensive approach that the Commission intends to adopt on this issue will be brought forward as soon as possible under Article 152 where Parliament will have a codecision function. endTok	40.71464238233612
startTok That is the appropriate way of dealing with this. endTok	19.004729007385766
startTok Mr President, in accordance with Article 69 (2), I call for referral back to committee. endTok	33.77221889572886
startTok The reason is that this concerns the approximation of a legal effect measure, as proposed by the Commission. endTok	51.009752988906236
startTok We have accepted this but have proposed further approximations of the legal effect measures that affect this directive, in particular the adoption of a text - which has been approved by the Commission overall - for the use and labelling of genetically modified organisms. endTok	47.764364096722
startTok We take the view that this should form part of this approximation at this time, but the Commission will not adopt this. endTok	35.06782757172214
startTok I believe that, in accordance with Article 69 (2), we must endeavour to enter into discussion with the Commission, and I would therefore urge my fellow MEPs to decide in favour of referral back to committee. endTok	23.898523550707175

startTok Before the vote: endTok	53.103803475848096
startTok Mr President, permit me to say quite publicly to Mrs Stenzel, who is a member of the ÖVP executive, that many MEPs are horrified that you have entered into a coalition with Haider, and that we wish to denounce you for doing so! endTok	52.021932133497856
startTok (Applause from the left. Heckling from the right) endTok	48.832124992864564
startTok . (DE) Mr Cohn-Bendit, I do not think that the European Parliament has any business intervening to such a huge extent in a country' s domestic politics, in the way that you are doing. endTok	31.733999306236864
startTok I can speak for my party, which championed Austria' s membership of the European Union in the early days. endTok	41.9071204411234

startTok I refuse to allow myself to be ostracised for internal and party political reasons! endTok	88.36292357198727
startTok This does not reflect the truth of the situation but is pure propaganda. endTok	41.07417081189667

startTok We are honoured by the visit of this delegation which is taking place shortly before the entry into force on 1 March 2000 of the Association Agreement between Morocco and the European Union. endTok	30.96964337410667
startTok On this historic occasion we welcome these developments in our relations and the prospects for closer ties between our two parliaments. endTok	73.50730131631836
startTok It is in this spirit that the delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries will be visiting Morocco on 20 to 22 March. endTok	45.62297574613159

startTok In particular, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 6, 16, 21, 28, 31, 33, 34, 44, 45, 46, 48, 52, 53, 65, 67, 68, 75, 76, 78, 80, 84, 85, 88 and 102. endTok	39.516666773637816
startTok The Commission can accept in part Amendments Nos 8, 18, 27, 29, 42, 43, 47, 54, 60, 62, 93, 94, 104 and 105. endTok	35.46990455590465
startTok The Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 30, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 50, 55, 56, 57, 58, 63, 69, 73, 79, 86, 89, 96, 99, 106 and 108. endTok	28.81884821349
startTok But the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 41, 49, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 74, 77, 83, 87, 90, 91, 92, 95, 97, 98, 81(rev.), 100, 101, 103 and 107. endTok	19.702063590455005

startTok . (FR) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on LIFE. endTok	55.942822321746426
startTok I shall briefly remind you that LIFE is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the European Union and also in third countries, whether they be neighbouring countries around the Mediterranean, countries around the Baltic Sea or applicant countries. endTok	44.876769106275674
startTok The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have, for the most part, been retained in the common position adopted by the Council. endTok	26.352830519570446
startTok As far as the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004) is concerned, the instrument is to be divided into three sections, LIFE-Nature (47% of the resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%). endTok	112.88793568085767
startTok In my opinion, the most important amendments concern the following: endTok	38.92582103387563
startTok LIFE' s contribution to sustainable development within the Community and also to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment, particularly regarding the integration of the environment into other policies, as well as to the implementation and updating of legislation relating to the environment; endTok	37.720482415671576
startTok Improving the efficiency, transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE, procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public, and procedures for cooperation between recipients; endTok	65.9252722570127
startTok The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere; endTok	88.59927784264711
startTok The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities, and thus job creation. endTok	71.57700675136196
startTok I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe. endTok	38.680714727573516
startTok The other candidate countries (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey, Malta) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries. endTok	315.6987382060466
startTok The stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies, of course, in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme (2000-2004). endTok	38.61909500256357
startTok The Commission proposal, ratified by the Council, is for EUR 613 million, whilst the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million. endTok	24.34289449532569
startTok I support Mrs Lienemann' s firm stance. endTok	41.725700109116865
startTok The financial allocation has not in fact been upgraded since the programme was created, even when the membership of the EC was increased to fifteen Member States following enlargement. endTok	57.23708974066017
startTok If the report is adopted in plenary session, then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened, in accordance with the codecision procedure, in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme. endTok	38.2697496452345
startTok This type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions! endTok	112.0836462210566
startTok Böge report (A5-0023/2000) endTok	13.869835807981854
startTok . (FR) As an MEP and, more importantly, as a consumer, I welcome the European Commission' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union. endTok	36.71455446679642
startTok This proposal has two objectives: first, to amend the 1991 Council Directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and, secondly, to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or BSE-type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species. endTok	120.31782871475298
startTok What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie. endTok	46.73424420917344
startTok What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis. endTok	55.712128403014496
startTok I also consider it essential, for the sake of coherence, that existing legislation on scrapie, which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals, should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs. endTok	65.62324122662972
startTok These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie. endTok	93.41809436643354
startTok A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic. endTok	118.2016746667708
startTok Even if this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to prevent and combat certain TSE needs to be made more accurate and more effective, especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie, it is still a notable improvement. endTok	50.69230365728413
startTok It is a pledge to European citizens, who have voiced their concern, as regards European food policy, on many occasions. endTok	65.22075634900058
startTok The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard. endTok	30.939901199310018
startTok As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution, traceability, responsibility and transparency, the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety. endTok	34.51710611039092
startTok This White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence. endTok	51.338393951871396
startTok It is up to us, as responsible Europeans, to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive. endTok	46.199410715148176

startTok Mr President, I voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the European Parliament. endTok	21.07874567321779
startTok In my view, products of the mind are far more valuable than tangible products, namely, those that can be seen and touched. endTok	138.48926429849263
startTok The fruits of the intellect and science, which are intangible, are of inestimable importance. Therefore, the European Community should be more energetic in providing practical encouragement, not just through upholding patents but through concessions and other forms of support for scientists who are striving, through the knowledge and experience they have acquired, to give future generations something better than that which they have today. endTok	69.19630992845538
startTok . (DA) We oppose, on principle, the European Community' s entering into treaties on copyright law on behalf of the Member States. endTok	97.4284954196569
startTok We are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a sharing of powers between the Member States and the Community. At the same time, we appreciate the fact that the WIPO treaties are a significant step forward in the direction of guaranteeing the rights of distributors and practising artists. endTok	30.39364213129118
startTok We are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation. endTok	17.921863205374727
startTok - (DE) The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained from the vote on this matter because, in the plenary debate of the previous day, Commissioner Bolkestein did not respond to any of my questions regarding EU accession to the WIPO Treaties. endTok	40.49234668890465
startTok In institutional terms, there has been no clarification of what role the EP is to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties. endTok	48.402070376788096
startTok In addition, there is a clear tendency, in matters of international jurisdiction, more and more often to obtain a pure EU jurisdiction. endTok	105.5384917409581
startTok When it is, then, still not clear to what extent the EP can participate in the decision-making processes, the question of legitimacy arises. endTok	39.3638071598452
startTok Moreover, the concept of 'author' is not defined in the Treaties. endTok	34.789527453636424
startTok In this regard, too, the Commission has not answered the question as to what definition it wishes to base its discussions on, and whether it wishes to settle foreseeable conflicts by imposing its own definition of the law on others. endTok	78.30884448305436
startTok One of the trickiest aspects is the public interest: will ratifying and applying WIPO lead to the privatisation of culture? endTok	99.42915127168737
startTok And, finally, the matter of the relationship between TRIPs and WIPO must be clarified. Regarding this, too, there has been only silence by way of a response from the Commission. endTok	64.24978500428743
startTok If nothing helpful is forthcoming in the course of a parliamentary debate planned for clarification and orientation, then we must at least abstain from voting. endTok	86.42728106683286
startTok Graefe zu Baringdorf (A5-0015/2000) endTok	40.267136297824656
startTok . (PT) Food safety issues are in the spotlight following the BSE and dioxin scandals. endTok	98.81532053183386
startTok GMOs are still the subject of great uncertainty, both in terms of their environmental impact and of their effects on human and animal health. endTok	80.54782970199997
startTok The precautionary principle must therefore apply in the absence of scientific certainty. endTok	31.59405076160822
startTok The use of biotechnology needs to be studied in greater depth and not just "packaged" for immediate sale to boost the profits of a few multinationals in this sector. endTok	34.528431786747994
startTok The profit motive is very much behind the present food safety crises. endTok	102.10554978688398
startTok This is the context that the rapporteur finds himself working in, making a legal link between the issue of GMOs and feedingstuffs, and noting that the latter "shall be authorised only if ... safe for human health and the environment" . endTok	68.4706470859698
startTok Furthermore, he considers that "genetically modified additives shall be clearly identified as such on any label or any document, official or otherwise, which is affixed to or accompanies the additive" . endTok	100.5096568439592
startTok This will facilitate greater control and traceability of such additives and guarantee the consumer' s freedom of choice. endTok	70.97306872370385
startTok In view of the Montreal Protocol on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), I welcome the fact that the rapporteur has included these issues in his report, and I have therefore voted in favour of it. endTok	27.199292082347586
startTok Stenzel report (A5-0034/2000) endTok	14.963813189038357
startTok Mr President, I would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote, on behalf of the PPE Group on the EQUAL report. endTok	13.549726951614591
startTok We have followed a nominal list which was identical to that which we had agreed upon beforehand with the Socialist Group. endTok	49.84913339401656
startTok The Socialist Group has now changed its mind and this is why the report is not as clear as it would have been. endTok	32.43639799135674
startTok This is why we are abstaining. endTok	9.3686750526603
startTok We want to ensure that the EQUAL report, which is very important for refugees, the elderly, the handicapped and women, simply goes ahead. endTok	42.56282973134098
startTok It is regrettable that, due to the procedure, the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session. endTok	31.83657777748842
startTok I am convinced that the rapporteur' s nationality has played a certain role, which should not be of relevance in this Parliament. endTok	21.001724215883595
startTok This is actually in conflict with European values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this Parliament. endTok	54.76614777879203
startTok These were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report. endTok	35.51269579928044
startTok We want EQUAL to go ahead. endTok	34.16317109516978
startTok We assent to the main thrust of it, but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage. endTok	78.28349434221252
startTok Mr President, as the representative of the Pensioners' Party in the European Parliament, I abstained in the vote on the EQUAL initiative because, although it provides more support than in the past for projects aimed at combating age discrimination, its proposals are not sufficiently trenchant or specific. endTok	52.67460711774034
startTok I also abstained for another reason. I think the time has come for the European institutions to stop experimenting and trying to establish best practices for doing what we should do and begin to give European citizens some firm indication regarding what Europe wants Europe to be. endTok	74.19334680395502
startTok The time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice. endTok	42.572684356066524
startTok . (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for EU initiative programmes (CIP). endTok	33.0610898467657
startTok Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote is only concerned with how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have simply adopted a position on the issue. endTok	50.57010473434543
startTok We think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report. endTok	34.55661393727332
startTok . (FR) We did not vote against this report insofar as it contains a number of correct general principles such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce inequalities between the sexes on the job market. endTok	42.780750931702784
startTok Nor did we vote for it because it is all too vague, all too pie in the sky. endTok	38.58274245927675
startTok And yet, in the chapter on aid and training for refugees, the report marks a step backwards from the initial text by stipulating that they no longer apply to refugees as such but to "refugees within the meaning of the Geneva Convention" . endTok	78.19992318906174
startTok This restriction is inadmissible at a time when countless refugees throughout Europe are in a drastic situation, with no protection, forced to work on the black market, and to hide, while so-called democratic governments and state police forces hunt them down. endTok	76.26773459506121
startTok The first thing we need to do in this area is to give these stateless people the legal means to live a decent life and be able to work without being relegated to the status of pariahs, the victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple forms of administrative and police harassment, the main form of which is having to live in permanent fear of expulsion. endTok	54.84167080849796
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok I voted in favour of Mrs Stenzel' s report on the EQUAL initiative as I believe that it is essential to continue the work begun under the previous NOW, HORIZON, YOUTHSTART and INTEGRA strands of the ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT initiatives. endTok	27.14819439134629
startTok The lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on. endTok	48.93641315933823
startTok EQUAL stands for "equality" . endTok	122.85421884237611
startTok It must be seen to deliver. endTok	32.50749971863543
startTok I welcome the proposed concentration on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and any form of inequality in the labour market. endTok	45.767481487072764
startTok I also favour the desire to move away from an out-dated format and to bring partners together in search of innovative ways to tackle unemployment. endTok	93.60693397506972
startTok There must be flexibility. endTok	36.66287559645986
startTok I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative. endTok	55.35968618161476
startTok In the last programming period 9% of Structural Funds were available for Community initiatives. endTok	54.486511547626804
startTok The figure is now 5.35%. endTok	109.40028806304274
startTok This means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated. endTok	51.29043546078278
startTok The Employment and Social Affairs Committee adopted several of the amendments I put forward, concerning for example, the emphasis on access to start-up capital, how to exploit new business opportunities in cities, towns and rural areas and the criticism that under the previous initiatives there was inadequate participation by business. endTok	96.24687121277535
startTok This often meant that good projects did not lead to real job opportunities. endTok	85.01759364634611
startTok The positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process. endTok	87.85615328413193
startTok I also stressed the need for prevention. endTok	44.84381618835855
startTok The involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted. endTok	28.415182281597367
startTok There must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority. endTok	39.00009050434165
startTok There must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets. endTok	149.46196281878733
startTok While there are some aspects of the report which I believe would be better dealt with in a different way, overall I believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported. endTok	54.15696642895847
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok (PT) The Commission intends to use the Community initiative EQUAL to replace the Community EMPLOYMENT and ADAPT initiatives and various subprogrammes in these areas, such as NOW, on new opportunities for women, HORIZON, for disabled persons, YOUTHSTART, for promoting the labour market integration of young people, and INTEGRA, for groups threatened with exclusion. Unfortunately, this involves a significant reduction in appropriations. endTok	93.35989190420044
startTok Accordingly, the Commission will use this initiative to develop what it considers to be new ways of fighting discrimination and inequality of all kinds in the labour market, based on the four pillars of the employment policy guidelines. endTok	54.36895672759466
startTok This is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations. endTok	23.992317135490925
startTok However, in order to give this new approach some chance of success, the Commission should have opted for a less complicated proposal, a more simple and direct one, involving the NGOs from the outset, so that partnerships could develop in a balanced way. endTok	97.59388506262853
startTok The Commission did not do that. endTok	39.39635862478761
startTok We hope that it will at least revisit the aspects that we have mentioned. endTok	29.792262852671865
startTok Mr President, some of us in Parliament will remember the successful film, "Cocoon", in which some elderly people drank a special kind of water that made them young again. endTok	99.07009000645868
startTok In my view, it is, therefore, immensely important to exercise extreme vigilance over the water we all drink and, consequently, to study and approve the provisions referred to here. endTok	73.97824170698787
startTok For that reason, I approved these measures, but I should also like to express the hope that there will be particularly rigorous monitoring of water purity at the point where it enters our houses, to ensure that it is of the highest level. endTok	38.496902502808396
startTok In the measures that have been adopted, I note that support for people who purify their water in their own homes has been omitted. I trust that this will be remedied in the future. endTok	40.2294146736045
startTok Apart from Amendment No 76, which was an error, since I intended to vote in favour, the rest of my votes can be explained by means of the following fictional situation: endTok	51.37086476765508
startTok Supposed draft environmental directive: "European Parliament and Council Directive establishing the obligation to maintain, during winter, a temperature of no less than eighteen degrees centigrade in the streets, squares and parks of the cities of Europe ". endTok	79.0160377027661
startTok Guidelines of the Directive: a) each city shall provide the means, in terms of energy and technology, sufficient for this objective to be achieved by 2012; b) the full costs shall be passed on to the inhabitants of each city by means of electricity prices. endTok	105.01706171042159
startTok Opinion of an MEP from the north of Europe: "This Directive would be unfair since, for example, the cost for an inhabitant of Stockholm would be two hundred times greater than the cost for an inhabitant of Naples ". endTok	44.11449722061303
startTok Opinion of an MEP from the south of Europe: "Nevertheless, this is a question of competitivity and equality of conditions". endTok	55.19497338148447
startTok (End of fiction). endTok	144.56498557323505
startTok In explaining my vote, I must say that it is positive that there is a Community directive on water, but I believe that environmental dogma will not lead to the construction of Europe, but will lead to legislative caricature. endTok	31.223556882525948
startTok We cannot give equal treatment to countries which suffer from floods and droughts, such as the Mediterranean countries, and countries with northern levels of rainfall. endTok	56.00332864163195
startTok Furthermore, it would show a lack of solidarity to make transfers of water, between different river basins, practically impossible in the future. endTok	121.80170945433919
startTok Once more we must remember that we are undergoing a continental project for political union. endTok	72.99876087840046
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok (FR) Drinking, eating, washing, farming - water irrigates each act of our daily life and we treat it, wrongly, as an unfailing and inexhaustible resource. endTok	114.65521919241722
startTok A simple gesture such as turning on a tap seems to bring water straight from the source. endTok	119.2344460796283
startTok But the source is threatening to run dry. endTok	97.5519647802637
startTok Scientific studies are now no more than a formality: water will be the main resource at stake in years to come, starting tomorrow. endTok	94.72854468908372
startTok But tomorrow will be too late. endTok	63.873782581489344
startTok We have to lay down the rules of play today, before we all lose. endTok	53.93395839453809
startTok In adopting the water directive on Wednesday 15 February, the European Parliament confirmed its wish to protect surface water, coastal wasters, inland waters and groundwater. endTok	61.93218411713927
startTok Europe now has a framework which will allow it to prevent any deterioration in the quality of water, promote its sustainable use, protect eco-systems, help fight floods and droughts and eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances. endTok	91.05334306543925
startTok We have thrown water a life-belt. endTok	125.3062769239546
startTok . (FR) It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy. endTok	32.23076307467227
startTok The ecological disaster on the banks of the Danube is a reminder, as if we needed one, that all too often human negligence jeopardises natural resources such as water. endTok	65.57325629637722
startTok The objective of this proposal for a directive, which dates back to 1997, is to put an end to the fragmentation of previous water legislation and protect surface water, coastal waters, inland waters and groundwater. endTok	49.14110034176175
startTok It provides a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration, protect ecosystems, promote sustainable water use, help to fight floods and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances. endTok	105.09160129492372
startTok Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework. endTok	87.28354763576496
startTok The procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy. endTok	159.2102595330964
startTok The proposal for a directive was amended twice, first in 1997 and then in 1998. endTok	53.9117428649603
startTok A technical working party made up of Council and Parliament representatives met in January 1999 to try and reconcile the positions of the two institutions. endTok	100.61798167961558
startTok However, the Committee on the Environment has tabled numerous amendments, most of which I support. endTok	50.03577868421514
startTok As far as the timetable and objectives are concerned, the Council' s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive, while the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this reduced to 10 years. endTok	37.97824270528168
startTok The committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020, the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020. endTok	76.54331345496323
startTok The Council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years, but the Commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years. endTok	104.99938635689625
startTok All the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within 10 years, not 16. endTok	127.39067780429377
startTok I must say that I support these reduced deadlines, especially as provision is made for derogations. endTok	76.03077054988539
startTok As far as costs are concerned, I approve the proposal whereby Member States will have to ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies provide incentives for more sensible use of water resources. endTok	61.532206369005685
startTok I likewise expect the European Commission to make a clear declaration undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policies reflect the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by 2012. endTok	51.40530478461591
startTok I will close by quoting one of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, which needs no further comment: "Water is not a commercial product like any other but, rather, a heritage which belongs to the peoples of the European Union and which must be protected, defended and treated as such" . endTok	43.11294373918888
startTok . I wish to put on the official record my concerns with the Lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote. endTok	55.823895635939245
startTok We have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water. endTok	37.219905059152694
startTok There is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur. endTok	31.802598380319846
startTok However, the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which, under the rules of subsidiarity, should be left to the Member States for decision. endTok	43.43209784976062
startTok In my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common European charge for this issue. endTok	58.14678784262572
startTok In Ireland all the major users of water, commercial, industrial and agricultural, already pay for their use of water. endTok	135.67891766761414
startTok This is a decision of national and local government, and this is where all future decisions should be retained. endTok	49.907249041548305
startTok These are the main reasons for my vote. endTok	21.55092706078213
startTok . The European Union is currently in the process of adopting new EU water legislation to update and to establish a long-term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources including rivers and coastal waters. endTok	49.896208162309776
startTok I support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy. endTok	25.409809921629833
startTok However, I do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used. endTok	92.22462177233166
startTok Water, in this context, is a commercial commodity. endTok	63.101370503591276
startTok It is an essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient supplies for normal daily life. endTok	108.59547062815722
startTok We see it as positive that an attempt is being made to reverse the trend towards water degradation, which is most alarming and which governments all too often tend to sweep under the carpet. endTok	89.46643997467366
startTok We all know that water is a commodity without which mankind cannot live and that it is imperative that its quality should be preserved. endTok	38.52712039430475
startTok But it is also essential to bear in mind that the various elements of water policy cannot be separated, and that action on this aspect will affect all the others. endTok	32.046443582327406
startTok The "physico-chemical and ecological quality of water" was highlighted during the debate and in the proposals, and the adverse effects of other aspects was, at best, touched upon marginally. endTok	65.79538266099016
startTok It is essential to be aware of the widely varying situations in different Member States, such as specific climatic conditions, water regimes and fluctuations in them over the year, the social, economic and ecological effects of applying standards, and also of the failure to do so. endTok	55.967929709263956
startTok It was because of our concern about these issues that we disagreed with some of the proposals put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and in particular those relating to an excessively restrictive timetable and to the scant attention paid to social and agricultural aspects, which are very important for a country like Portugal, which suffers from water shortage problems and also inadequate socio-economic development. endTok	42.71574651670918
startTok But we also believe that, in many cases, the proposals put forward by the Commission and the Council represent too much of a step backwards, which is why we would like to see a vote balanced between the various requirements in the proposals presented to us. endTok	37.08178212204004
startTok . (FR) We are disappointed by the Council' s common position on this proposal for a framework directive. endTok	24.753017978851123
startTok It is minimalist on a number of points, especially with regard to the dates of entry into force of far too many provisions and the number of, and conditions for, implementing the derogations. endTok	44.14153603305551
startTok However, the main problem is with the definition of the objective which the European Union wishes to pursue with this text. endTok	36.639605406655555
startTok The objective is of course to create, first and foremost, a clear general framework which will allow the law in this area to be simplified. endTok	44.075420188814974
startTok However the Union should be seeking, beyond that, to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater. endTok	62.29473709975576
startTok Public health and the supply of drinking water are at stake, as are biological quality and diversity and the conservation of rural areas and species. endTok	57.951505696062995
startTok From this point of view, the common position is weak. endTok	29.52515058009178
startTok I should like to see our Parliament defend a more ambitious position than the Council' s position, but I should also like that position to be equally credible. endTok	43.85057996286135
startTok The "zero input" and "zero pollution" requirement, including for substances naturally present in water, is not realistic. endTok	325.07896030479253
startTok I am not one of those MEPs who thinks that it is essential to adopt "extremist" amendments at second reading with the sole aim of gaining room for manoeuvre in preparation for negotiations with the Council of Ministers. endTok	41.04745482892696
startTok On the contrary, I object to this systematically applied strategy. endTok	59.11208269918793
startTok It damages Parliament. endTok	105.11159771772785
startTok Our messages to our citizens and to the Council are muddled and lack credibility. endTok	133.16858309214712
startTok Overly strict, unrealistic environmental objectives will not be applied because they are unattainable. endTok	62.09875904417627
startTok Is that the message we want to send out? endTok	62.92262422247169
startTok There is one other specific point which is dear to me: Member States should be able, if they so wish, to set up trans-national water transfers. endTok	78.80712730896258
startTok This type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity, which we have always defended, and, as such, should enjoy the widespread support of the European Union in the context of the promotion of trans-European networks and regional policy (through the Structural Funds). endTok	32.826573518785324
startTok I would like to remind the House that we adopted an own initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans-European water networks two years ago and I would be most obliged if the European Commission could shortly tell Parliament what action it has taken on that report. endTok	64.34476759293582
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok (ES) We have seen a report concerned with water quality in Europe transformed into an instrument of commercial war. endTok	114.55466707133338
startTok We all agree that ensuring water quality is a hugely important objective, above all, given the adverse effects of developing a model of accelerated industrial growth on the natural environment. endTok	60.44766989899209
startTok It is clear that this model' s logic of private profit has been harmful, and therefore the 'polluter pays' principle is a suitable way of dealing with these consequences. endTok	38.587415754336504
startTok However, apart from these principles, there is the consideration that water, as a common resource, cannot be subjected to the rules of the market. endTok	50.799813582228076
startTok Surprisingly, I imagine with the best of intentions, this ecological objective has become an instrument of commercial war by making consumers, and especially the agricultural sector, responsible for the price of installations and the procedures for ensuring water quality. endTok	86.04445016552417
startTok In fact, water becomes simply one more product subject to the laws of the market. endTok	79.60140975083249
startTok This means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water. endTok	24.710492359741302
startTok By failing to distinguish countries and regions where water is abundant, and is therefore not a problem, from regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity, stifling the chances of any economic and social development, we are perverting the ecological principle and turning it into a weapon. endTok	70.84552918267654
startTok In the same way it is somewhat ironic that we are hindering the possibility of sharing this commodity, which is scarce in some areas, while regions where there is abundant water are giving advice on austerity with regard to its use, to those who live in drought areas. endTok	43.55636984908494
startTok As a result of this lack of sensitivity and solidarity, my vote has been consistent with what I have said, as an MEP from one of the dry Mediterranean agricultural regions - although one with prospects - namely, the Region of Murcia. endTok	90.94954733040689
startTok . On behalf of the European Parliament Labour Party, I wish to indicate that while we have supported the major part of the Lienemann report, we have certain reservations. endTok	39.84443618895662
startTok The timetable set in the report of 2020 is unrealistic and impracticable, but the timetable set by the Council of 2034 is too far in the distance. endTok	69.9768626456899
startTok We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date. endTok	84.55298730404701
startTok We have voted against Amendments Nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater. endTok	51.645566970888
startTok We believe this requirement is unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involved in restoration to a near pristine standard. endTok	102.63669759975042
startTok The foregoing is the reason for our vote. endTok	23.990177870773767
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok (FR) Water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed. endTok	72.71652347031817
startTok The framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of Community policy in this area. endTok	29.665184444741353
startTok It has clear, ambitious objectives. endTok	148.48047559698446
startTok We share them. endTok	70.54056368697574
startTok It sets environmental parameters close to zero. endTok	142.7602117437845
startTok But we feel that it would be wiser not to set unrealistic deadlines which neither our governments nor our industries will be able to meet. endTok	65.24069429084007
startTok We need a timetable, by all means, but a more gradual timetable. endTok	121.67933920950995
startTok The legal obligation to achieve a zero input situation, i.e. to stop discharges within 20 years, would in fact mean a ban on all identified substances. endTok	147.07630563990188
startTok Such provisions may well cause serious problems in cross-border areas and in candidate countries, thereby complicating enlargement. endTok	73.06315021596846
startTok I should like, naturally, to refer to a specific sector to which I am very closely attached, i.e. agriculture, the main water-consuming sector. Agriculture must accept its share of 'polluter pays' charges, and has in fact already started to do so, but account must also be taken of its special characteristics and constraints, especially in arid regions. endTok	100.73333983502368
startTok As regards the amendments concerning radioactive substances, I am of course in favour of controls, but the question arises of the legal basis, which comes under the Euratom Treaty. endTok	48.82207856115983
startTok Andersson report (A5-0033/2000) endTok	13.55851354687976
startTok The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities has not been able to vote in favour of the Andersson report. This does, of course, contain a number of good observations. endTok	28.430720932685116
startTok For example, it is acknowledged on page 15 of the explanatory statement that "the different levels of development and traditions in the field of social security in the Member States make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the Member States' social security systems" . endTok	36.793402392715805
startTok Now, the concept of "uniform harmonisation" is one of those muddled expressions which totally obfuscates the integration process in question. It is also true, as it states in the explanatory statement, that harmonisation could be damaging as "it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security. endTok	78.52010313719511
startTok No-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation" . endTok	36.66452770360581
startTok The situation, however, is that a social model is being established whose real purpose is harmonisation, and uniform harmonisation into the bargain. endTok	109.60460465444385
startTok Paragraph D points out that "the Union may provide added value by adoption of proper binding and effective convergence criteria" , and the report goes on to emphasise that the development of this convergence process is to be promoted by means of joint talks between the Ecofin Council and the Social Affairs and Employment Councils. endTok	69.57703121861913
startTok Finally, paragraph 7 emphasises that "the social convergence process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious fiscal coordination" . And, in this regard, we approach the heart of the matter. endTok	62.61308831188397
startTok This project, with its social harmonisation, does not constitute social policy. Instead, it is an extension to the EU' s EMU project, which is of quite special interest to the three countries which remain outside EMU and can rescue themselves from the sinking ship, namely Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark. endTok	106.16831488675226
startTok It is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the EMU project. endTok	42.06327706341358
startTok ) Mr President, I voted for the Council's strategy for modernising social protection because, in my view, it constitutes a step towards the establishment of European social and pensions legislation, although it does not actually go the whole way. endTok	31.675454898955785
startTok I was sorry to hear what was said in the previous explanation of vote, since I believe that, in essence, the report aims to provide much better protection for the elderly, despite the fact that, as we all know, the governments of the 15 Member States would like to reduce pensions to the minimum. endTok	42.35445976355003
startTok I hope that Parliament will soon have the authority to legislate on pensions. endTok	44.71657457461914
startTok The elderly are waiting for the European Parliament to make it possible for them to live more comfortably and with greater dignity than they do now. endTok	39.892837800915125
startTok The countries who have made less progress in this field should attain the same level as the countries within the European Union that guarantee better social protection. endTok	65.67727275947706
startTok . (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted today in favour of the report by our Swedish Social Democratic colleague, Jan Andersson, on the Commission' s communication concerning a coordinated strategy for modernising social security. endTok	39.19684534637165
startTok The starting point for the Commission' s communication is the implementation of EMU which, with its demand for stability and growth, creates the basis for the Member States' being able to maintain their social security arrangements. endTok	50.15865960370632
startTok The report states that modernisation does not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but, rather, better use of available resources. endTok	53.84820662052098
startTok We also notice that, according to the explanatory statement, modernisation does not mean harmonisation of social security arrangements, either, and that harmonisation might be downright damaging as it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time that competitive considerations might exert pressure on others to cut back. endTok	85.61088294393606
startTok No-one would benefit from this situation. endTok	31.78491372251833
startTok Both in the communication from the Commission and in the report by Mr Andersson, it is emphasised that it is the Member States which have responsibility for and, therefore, also determine the content of, social security arrangements. endTok	43.584781122977304
startTok Cooperation on these matters within the framework of the EU should create added value, based on the exchange of experiences and the reciprocal evaluation of the way in which policies are developing, the aim being to define best practice. endTok	63.691906802902196
startTok . (SV) We consider that the report contains many practical proposals, which we support, but we are very critical of the convergence approach which permeates the report. endTok	60.49689197629566
startTok In particular, we oppose the sections which deal with fiscal harmonisation and with the Commission' s becoming involved in telling the Member States what to do (see, for example, paragraph 7). endTok	102.54639228104595
startTok We wish to emphasise that the sphere of social and social security policy should chiefly be the domain of the Member States, even if the enlargement of the EU requires a greater degree of coordination than there has been in the past. endTok	25.254247755338532
startTok . (FR) The current difficulties faced by our social security systems derive mainly from a shortage of income as the result of unemployment, poverty and an ageing population rather than from excessive spending. endTok	83.81374147156635
startTok The policies of the European Union also have much to answer for in this situation. endTok	53.514776872275974
startTok Of course we need to modernise these systems. endTok	35.37223771341146
startTok In France, in particular, we need to stop making labour alone fund medical insurance and pensions. endTok	122.45072941676499
startTok We also need to reform archaic management methods which create injustices, chaos and waste. endTok	41.626981882160095
startTok More importantly, we need a family policy to promote demographic growth and an economic, monetary and fiscal policy to promote growth and reconquer the internal market so that we can create jobs. endTok	42.521294894730744
startTok The Commission and the Andersson report are not proposing a social policy; they are giving Brussels exorbitant decision-making powers as regards funding, i.e. as regards the organisation and the provision of social protection services in the countries of Europe, which is why we voted against this text. endTok	52.61501259847946
startTok Social protection should be an expression, first and foremost, of national solidarity and it comes first and foremost, exclusively in fact, under the jurisdiction of the nation state. endTok	87.05510337479573
startTok Social protection should be based on the principle of national and Community preferences. endTok	27.56607304773131
startTok Otherwise it is merely the financial processing, at the expense and to the detriment of European citizens, of the intolerable social situations which result from immigration. endTok	73.95870161973468
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok (SV) We have abstained from voting for Jan Andersson' s report on a coordinated strategy for modernising social security. endTok	44.93211939738187
startTok We are basically well disposed towards the European Union. endTok	22.04460989631917
startTok As Swedish Liberals, we see European integration as an opportunity to find solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management. endTok	96.85513787773479
startTok In these areas, Europe' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity. endTok	75.43801524216195
startTok We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those they affect. endTok	51.91588313797856
startTok That is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the European Union where the distribution of responsibilities is clear for all to see. endTok	36.663513703094324
startTok It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU will only become involved in those issues it is best qualified to deal with, which is to say cross-border issues. endTok	52.648604666895764
startTok All other questions ought to be dealt with at local, regional or national levels. endTok	62.843613737436144
startTok Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU ought only to have limited powers, except where it is a question of freedom of movement for people within the Union. endTok	33.726539041537265
startTok Each Member State ought to have full responsibility for, and the right autonomously to decide upon, its social security systems. endTok	55.530265472897426
startTok Health care, child care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas which are not obviously transnational. endTok	133.5726722186605
startTok The same applies to labour market policy. endTok	60.74354630382137
startTok We do not believe that common European legislation in these areas is a solution to the problems involved in designing systems of social security. endTok	40.03037795103609
startTok For us, it is important that the EU should instead concentrate on just a few areas in which it can really be of use. endTok	44.91597833061376
startTok That does not, however, prevent the Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere. endTok	30.356570390747457
startTok Equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our Liberal agenda. endTok	174.87744043226957
startTok We wholeheartedly support, at national level, many of the ideas presented in Mr Andersson' s report. endTok	56.02897079956458
startTok . (IT) The report gives a clear impression that the concerted strategy for modernising social protection in Europe will be accompanied by an analogous process of cohesion. endTok	36.119555804237464
startTok We therefore view it with interest and hope and commend its intentions. endTok	244.4084518820834
startTok Numerous policies have already gone in this direction, albeit laboriously, and many more still need to do so before Europe, in terms of subsidiarity, is seen as one house, not only by its own people, but also by those in the candidate countries. endTok	76.45416259962292
startTok Moreover, the European welfare systems have always played a constructive role in the social and democratic development of each nation. endTok	44.1642635484057
startTok Consequently, if such systems are to continue to sustain development in the future, in light of the economic and employment changes taking place, as well as the requirements of society, modernisation is absolutely essential. endTok	46.875407223705714
startTok There are three main aspects that need to be highlighted. endTok	28.397072487444756
startTok The first is that economic policy, employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that is directly proportional. endTok	22.99684202120201
startTok The second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them. endTok	59.80305961214664
startTok Nowadays, it is becoming more commonplace, as well as efficient, to operate complementary and integrated protection schemes. endTok	89.1521556796945
startTok But, in our view, that does not mean that the role of the public authority should be reduced, either as regards the universality or, we hope, the quality of the basic social protection provided. endTok	46.147505123383034
startTok It is, to a large extent, a principle of justice that imbues both health and pension schemes as well as social assistance, where, in particular, strategic coordination by the public authority is essential, even though it has been modernised. endTok	61.831415884648
startTok The third aspect concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins the European Union. endTok	22.7753438169582
startTok Today, a common strategy for social protection is sadly lacking, and the current systems are, in the main, run according to the actions and unity of purpose of individual Member States. endTok	76.67368820771242
startTok Therefore, any modernisation process has to take account of economic, employment and social protection differences between the various countries, whether Member States or candidate countries. endTok	63.35652886836767
startTok What is required is that those responsible for the modernisation process, which continues to be closely linked to the promotion of social cohesion despite the underlying differences, should have the will and the know-how to ensure that changes are for the better and not for the worse. endTok	59.37293381414169
startTok It is, after all, a matter of civilisation, progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community. endTok	66.68215284621702
startTok . (SV) The basic values common to the Member States of the European Union are based upon democracy, human freedoms and rights, and a social market economy. endTok	83.01613262503675
startTok These values must be given expression in the form of solidarity with the weaker groups in our society and in the world around us. endTok	57.73281389942521
startTok In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is the Member States themselves which devise their own social security systems. endTok	24.68802673286427
startTok Inhabitants of countries in the European Union ought, nonetheless, to be able to benefit from a minimum network of social protection, irrespective of which country they live in. endTok	61.715095029641176
startTok The report seeks "effective and ambitious fiscal coordination" , without going on to define more specifically what this means. endTok	145.65860255946083
startTok As we see it, such a position constitutes unduly large interference in national fiscal policy and cannot, therefore, be supported. endTok	121.84992504719955
startTok We are therefore voting against paragraph 7 of the report. endTok	18.658622906601302
startTok The report emphasises the social dimension of European cooperation, which is something to be welcomed. endTok	28.236487768976247
startTok It is nonetheless important to clarify what role the EU is to play, and not to play, with regard to social security. endTok	50.32757380767469
startTok Clarification of this kind is missing from the report, which is unfortunate. endTok	41.92330969387313
startTok . (EL) On reading the Commission' s statement on social protection, which is animated by so many good intentions, one wonders whether its authors and the working people in Europe are living on the same continent and in the same social reality. endTok	55.961791900477465
startTok One also wonders whether this 'coordinated modernisation strategy' is not just another misrepresentation of the coordinated and headlong attack on social protection and security and on the acquired rights of working people. endTok	67.4734894422382
startTok We agree with many of the rapporteur' s remarks but do not at all share his optimism about the Commission' s and the Council' s intentions and plans concerning social protection. endTok	46.87876013400923
startTok The general lines of the implemented economic policy, the Stability Pact and the strict convergence programmes, which are a constant menace to employment and which promote employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations, and the organisation of labour, along with Commission and the ESF decisions relating to salary and wage restraint, and the insistence upon austere budgetary discipline and upon achieving much-vaunted monetary stability at all costs, leave no doubt about the new strategy' s objectives and aspirations. endTok	94.277874062536
startTok Its sole purpose is to pave the way and create the right conditions for cutting public expenditure on social security, and for flexibilising social protection itself. endTok	67.35718474467284
startTok When social security has repeatedly, and in the words of many influential people, been characterised as a 'cost' and an 'obstacle' to greater competitiveness and when ways are being sought to transfer that cost from companies to working people - always, of course, on the pretext that this will create jobs - it would surprise us if the existing model of market economy without accountability, with its dismal monetary-economic approach to everything and total dependence on monopolistic interests, were to take under its protection the fundamental right of the citizens to social protection and care. endTok	122.09519010284674
startTok Clearly, what is being attempted is to move away from organised systems of social security under state control, towards systems based on private insurance agencies, which will generate new profits for capital and place even greater burdens on working people, who besides the higher cost, will 'enjoy' even more degraded social provisions. endTok	156.97372489573203
startTok The fostering of illicit competition between public and private social security systems and between the systems of the Member States is not only unjustifiable, but, on the contrary, makes manifest the political expediencies and intolerable pressures imposed upon social security systems to weaken or even do away with them, to the benefit of the private sector and the law of profit. endTok	48.27680500397723
startTok It is well known that the level and quality of employment determines the quality of social security systems. endTok	26.5300262803003
startTok So how is it possible to speak about healthy and economically sustainable social security systems when we are faced with the millions of unemployed, impoverished and marginalised people, the 'working poor' of part-time employment, and working conditions that are dissociated from the policies implemented? endTok	73.65887775636246
startTok Social security and protection are among the greatest acquisitions of working people in Europe, and were achieved after many years of battling against the aspirations of big business, and by the constant expression of the solidarity that characterises working people. endTok	102.14216951765964
startTok Today, in the Europe of unemployment and underemployment, it is urgently necessary to establish broader social protection and to extend the rights of working people, but this demands a different system of economic and social development, which the EU cannot possibly create, because of its nature and character. endTok	80.11303598312831
startTok On the basis of these views, we wish to express our categorical opposition to the 'modernisation' of the social protection system that the Commission statement is promoting, and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is under discussion. endTok	25.269636306071277
startTok That concludes the explanations of vote. endTok	43.32534475430042
startTok (The sitting was suspended at 1.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) endTok	7.065847964290493
startTok Next session of UN Human Rights Commission (continuation) endTok	126.38979308457607
startTok The next item is the debate on the Council declaration on the establishing of the EU priorities for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (20 March 2000), including the situation in China. endTok	34.33920775467629
startTok Mr President, I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. This is a Council declaration, and I believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate. endTok	25.228189923605736
startTok I think it is worth reminding you that the inclusion of this item on the agenda clearly reflects the need, which has been expressed by all the political Groups, for Parliament to hold a debate before the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, so that it may express its opinion on such a sensitive issue, one which is so dear to this House. endTok	45.817681536641224
startTok Following the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, I believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see. endTok	25.901795142897477
startTok At a European Union level we must recognise that the situation is not completely satisfactory, since, for example, although the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a common instrument in all Member States, not all subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all of them. endTok	52.27554462054411
startTok Another clear drawback in this area is the fact that the European Union itself is not a signatory to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, with all the additional disadvantages that this situation entails. endTok	32.38253295634452
startTok I hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights. endTok	19.93049872531073
startTok With regard to foreign affairs, I believe that the majority of points which we have included in the resolution accurately illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism, Mr President. Issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, the torture which still goes on in many supposedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world, demand a clear, visible and effective response from the European Union. endTok	63.920307956767424
startTok In my opinion, this resolution contains a series of essential points, but I would like to stress one in particular, that is, the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations. endTok	18.09698368966482
startTok Mr President, in a world such as this, which is increasingly dominated by the phenomenon of globalisation, and not only in the economic field, our responses, in order to be effective, must be concerted and coordinated. endTok	63.03854571473677
startTok In order to make our actions effective, we must implement a type of coordination in practice which does not exist at present. endTok	49.04256099324966
startTok This Parliament therefore advocates the principle that we need to participate in the Commission on Human Rights and other international fora which deal with these issues and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this Parliament would like to be able to participate in this type of meeting as soon as possible. endTok	23.349685279509934
startTok Soon, in May, the European Commission intends to present a communication on the development of the role of human rights and democratisation in the Union' s external relations. endTok	36.65142652946278
startTok I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to take good note of this need for coordination, which I have just mentioned, and to seek new formulas which will strengthen the role played by the European Union in the field of human rights and, in particular, by this Parliament, especially from the point of view of coherence, recognising the good will of those third countries which accept the inclusion of the democratic clause. endTok	39.62146902887417
startTok I believe that this should be applied to all areas, in particular also the budgetary area. endTok	38.04667646802622
startTok Lastly, I must recognise the important contributions made by civil society in this area, as well as the often underestimated role of the numerous non-governmental organisations who act on the ground. endTok	45.62777291630846
startTok The Union must make every effort to provide all the necessary support for them to carry out their important work. endTok	43.1475256320314
startTok Mr President, Commissioners, when this House is called upon to debate human rights it is taking a chance, if you will, that is reinforced by the conditions that prevail when we are called upon to discuss such a crucial issue. endTok	62.569901223234474
startTok The absence of the Council, as well as of the majority of MEPs, shows just how great the divide is between our noble, elevated and worthy formal statements and the concrete reality in terms of our day-to-day policies when it comes to human rights. endTok	75.12581760993322
startTok I believe that, as a beginning, Parliament is called upon to use the opportunity provided by the Geneva session to narrow that divide. It should adopt an approach that is not just a statement of principle but is an acknowledgement of the true situation and possibly even a pledge of support. endTok	62.79323084643395
startTok We must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the headlines or abuses are being punished. endTok	37.651890280442544
startTok The role of Parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on, particularly at the level of prevention. endTok	51.18457187797133
startTok In that sense, we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law. endTok	37.68730288009607
startTok It seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed. endTok	52.23434419916044
startTok Nowadays, there are many, perhaps too many, treaties on human rights. If those treaties remain mere expressions, they are no more than useless depositories of people's thoughts. endTok	112.93423825379044
startTok The time has come to move on to a new and crucial phase, namely a phase in which the provisions of the treaties are applied on a daily and binding basis, although we ought not forget that some basic treaties are still to be transposed. endTok	59.12719277497384
startTok I refer to the Rome Conference and the fact that 14 of the 15 Member States of the Union have still not ratified the treaty establishing an International Criminal Court. endTok	47.09061241782046
startTok In my view, we should be evaluating and modifying some of the political instruments we use to measure the status of human rights globally. endTok	32.10323960528433
startTok We have often employed instruments which, at the formal level, make us feel comfortable, but which, in terms of practical results, are totally ineffectual. endTok	179.00610141146765
startTok By that I mean the use, and often abuse, of embargoes during recent years, and the over-cautious application of the clause allowing suspension of the agreements between the European Union and third countries, where there have been human rights violations. endTok	77.51152801586711
startTok In particular, we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded. endTok	28.199653549300773
startTok Globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process. endTok	75.17250919774621
startTok Many countries are currently questioning the principle of the universality of human rights. The belief is widespread that many human rights, including the right to life, contradicted as it is by the death penalty, depend on certain variables, while globalisation, which often has a negative connotation, is in danger of becoming the catch-all for rights, actions and policies everywhere in the world. endTok	99.32745820253638
startTok We should therefore do what is necessary to update the areas in which we can intervene, with renewed strength, to safeguard human rights. endTok	68.1391145994728
startTok In that context I would mention the following: social rights, workers' rights, quality of work, the need to ensure respect, where necessary, for all the criteria laid down by the International Labour Organisation, the right to tolerance and to respect - a right to which all minorities are entitled, particularly within the European Union. endTok	93.61407588981025
startTok I would also mention the right to develop. It is the right of all peoples who, in turn, are the sum of countless individuals each one of whom has the right to develop and to a future that, most importantly, is full of hope and personal growth, within each individual society. endTok	78.50310662550834
startTok All those aspects should be part of a rationale, a discourse and a contribution which the European Union should bring to human rights. endTok	43.423265916615414
startTok I hope that Parliament's participation in the Geneva session turns out to be more than just a token presence and that its representatives do more than just listen to and give evidence. First and foremost they should use the occasion to affirm that we regard the aspects I have just mentioned as central to the identity of the European Union and of the European nation, and that we also uphold the principle of the universality of human rights that transcends time and place. endTok	56.75252244590855
startTok That is what we hope for and is the cordial message that we are sending our governments, even if it goes against their interests. endTok	54.94556060557023
startTok Mr President, one of the saving features of this Parliament is that here we practise a consistent and active human rights policy: the flag flies high, as Mrs Malmström put it. endTok	93.68793737287821
startTok At the same time, however, we shut our eyes to the Union' s own problems: to the violence, inequality, and fourth world reality, which is part of everyday life in the EU. endTok	63.835904820013546
startTok It is absolutely right that we pay serious attention to the violations of human rights that are to be the subject of talks in Geneva. endTok	37.888363433408074
startTok The rhetoric that we use, however, often smacks of smugness, verging on the sort of narcissism we associate with human rights attitudes in North America. endTok	49.338502855969665
startTok It is nothing less than hypocritical to condemn the flagrant violation of human rights that occurs in non-EU countries if we are not prepared to extend a helping hand to those genuine refugees and asylum-seekers, whose position is now becoming more difficult in the EU. endTok	54.48075701720539
startTok Let us, in particular, focus attention on the re-admission clauses, which present a threat to the Geneva Convention and which should be blocked. endTok	49.142283687292554
startTok Unless we can maintain high standards of human rights with respect to refugees and asylum-seekers, we are not worthy of those European values which make up the European identity, as Vaclav Havel said here today, and among which he particularly mentioned respect for human rights and solidarity. endTok	68.99355404508498
startTok I worked for many years on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and it was really moving to see how a nation in such difficult circumstances was reaching out for a more open, European-style, pluralistic democratic society. endTok	122.21821167232262
startTok I fear that we are now moving in the opposite direction, towards European exclusiveness and apartheid. endTok	33.21454431046806
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my view, the question which needs to be raised in Geneva this year is certainly not the death penalty. endTok	19.363343478495366
startTok We have already had three resolutions on the death penalty approved in Geneva. endTok	55.761243292532086
startTok We failed at the General Assembly last year on a fallacious pretext, I refer to article 2.7, which we are otherwise happy to adopt for all other texts. endTok	69.50875347630897
startTok The question of the death penalty should therefore be raised at this year' s General Assembly, certainly not at the Geneva session. endTok	49.97659587708277
startTok As Mr Patten said, and I would like to thank him for the positions which he defended, the crucial point is China. endTok	27.77818984752114
startTok Unfortunately, the positions taken by the Commission and the Council, or at least the presidency, are more than just a hair' s breadth apart; this is serious, especially in the light of the Council' s macho position on Austria. endTok	42.73545754348786
startTok In my view, as far as China is concerned, and knowing that the European Union' s policy towards China has been a total failure, allegedly constructive dialogue has got us nowhere or, worse, it has given the Chinese new pretexts for increasing repression and for strengthening religious repression and the repression of freedoms (as Mrs Wallström has said with regard to the Internet) in all sectors, in Tibet, in inland Mongolia, in eastern Turkistan. endTok	76.87144458128486
startTok There is regression in every sector of Chinese civil society. endTok	76.09152075406435
startTok It is a fact: China is the major threat, the major threat to us, the threat which we must confront, the threat to peace. endTok	61.76219787651797
startTok It is the antithesis of democracy and you know as well as I that the Chinese, the Chinese leadership, is Communist first and Chinese second. endTok	102.29785239228198
startTok China likes doublespeak. endTok	164.54533591845615
startTok Until we have a firm position, we will achieve nothing with the Chinese authorities. endTok	66.01590051356496
startTok I think we need to seize the opportunity. endTok	17.965444192918053
startTok We need to associate ourselves with the American initiative. endTok	36.77053152624079
startTok We need to table a strong text and that text needs to be adopted. endTok	35.57863778965742
startTok We need to work. endTok	25.275191736873136
startTok The Fifteen need to start work right now, with all the members of the United Nations; we need, at long last, to issue a firm condemnation and then use that as a basis to gain a negotiating position. endTok	111.26434063145318
startTok Mr President, I would like to try to put a different perspective to this. endTok	15.732445076695727
startTok As you know, on Monday an unmanned spacecraft went into orbit around a peanut-shaped asteroid called Eros which is not very far from earth. endTok	44.94606943544786
startTok Photographs show us that there is no life on the asteroid, but much further out in our galaxy, the Milky Way, there are about 300 billion stars, many with planets. endTok	57.99592963850143
startTok Beyond the Milky Way there are 300 billion other galaxies with countless stars and planets. endTok	34.215380536604215
startTok It is probable, therefore, that there is a lot of life out there, and much of it much more advanced than we are. endTok	41.035340959683275
startTok Bearing in mind that the first television programmes from earth are now 50 light years out into space way beyond the nearest stars, I invite you to imagine with me what life out there in the stars thinks of us as they look at us. endTok	130.7266349772385
startTok What do they see? endTok	59.68688304682861
startTok They see a beautiful planet, teeming with life, but they see its atmosphere being polluted and warming up. endTok	91.72548507932584
startTok They see forests being cut down and deserts spreading. endTok	65.52783996860201
startTok Of the living creatures, they can see many animals that are treated cruelly, rare ones becoming extinct for ever. endTok	163.31030511814254
startTok How do they see the currently dominant species - that is us? endTok	81.8145568957141
startTok Well, they see the planet's resources being unevenly spread. endTok	122.96616039260333
startTok They see land being fought over, medicine for disease but not in the parts of the world where it is most wanted, books for schools - but not at all in the least-developed areas of our world, 50% of the world's population never making a telephone call in their whole life. endTok	83.53110345718753
startTok What do they see about the relationships between human beings? endTok	47.947558824357436
startTok They see us killing each other. endTok	60.50713358705453
startTok They see us restricting each other's liberties. endTok	111.25617046574902
startTok They see a never-ending series of local wars. They see some of our children drafted into the army as soldiers, or treated as prostitutes or slaves. endTok	88.53065236338209
startTok They see unequal treatment of men and women, of people of different ages, of minorities, of people of different coloured skins, of races, of beliefs, of immigrants, even neighbours. endTok	67.89741938982364
startTok We all know the picture. endTok	39.53005700398516
startTok The UN Convention on Human Rights 50 years ago was an attempt to correct this. endTok	47.92999169122958
startTok We should salute it - and I think we do. endTok	46.73473447347736
startTok Only in Europe are human rights enforceable in law. endTok	90.34984388028427
startTok Here in the European Parliament some of the Members do not want the Charter of Rights, which is being discussed at the moment, to become enforceable in law. endTok	31.86429491132529
startTok I say: shame on them! endTok	51.25437379538665
startTok Human rights should be enforceable in law in every country of the world. endTok	39.52715430295639
startTok That is the goal which we have to work towards. endTok	30.998438564680804
startTok Much, as Commissioner Patten said, remains to be done. endTok	40.13287774743113
startTok Finally, if you asked me: What if there is no life out there among the stars, what if we are alone? - which is an equally awe-inspiring thought - I would say: Do not you think we have a responsibility too to make our children behave properly, before letting them go out to populate other planets? endTok	80.52928067837894
startTok Mr President, human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated and interwoven. endTok	29.837650230590803
startTok This well-known phrase, which is taken from the conclusions of the UN World Conference on human rights of 1993, is known off by heart by many. endTok	153.6300330007117
startTok That is positive. endTok	48.22735998701655
startTok But what about the human rights policy within the EU itself? endTok	32.39161365196319
startTok Does it reflect this vision of coherence? endTok	92.70123101247947
startTok In fact, does the European Union have a human rights policy? endTok	32.97797235569128
startTok This question does not challenge the efforts made by the Member States who wish to bring their viewpoints on foreign policy into line and to display a united front against violations of human rights elsewhere, for example in China. endTok	41.76063284307709
startTok No, Mr President, I am talking about the lack of human rights policy within the European Union itself. endTok	19.565867469135966
startTok A new government has come into power in Austria, comprising a political party which has sent out a message of racism and intolerance vis-à-vis minorities. endTok	70.67031741550926
startTok Human rights, which the EU embraces, are thus under threat, but the reactions to these events have brought to light the fact that there is no coherent framework in which an appropriate reaction can be formulated. endTok	59.03405670046257
startTok The widely quoted Article 7 of the Treaty, which provides for the repeal of membership rights from a Member State where serious and continuous violations against human rights have been established, is, of course, only a kill or cure remedy, an ultimum remedium, which, in the case of Austria, can only be quoted in the absence of anything more effective, and by way of warning. endTok	64.94251183337002
startTok There is, therefore a need for a fully-fledged human rights policy for and by the European Union, a policy which promotes and enforces human rights within the EU itself. endTok	37.53667770923699
startTok Such policy should comprise various components. endTok	212.42341915584464
startTok Firstly: a regulatory framework is needed, which spells out very clearly the rights which the EU intends to secure for its citizens. endTok	88.84664322875645
startTok A start is now being made on the drafting of such a charter, but we can no longer put off the question of legal status and the strategic significance of this document or pass it on to learned professional jurists. endTok	95.01010092905081
startTok This is a political question which, in the short term, requires an answer from the IGC and this Parliament. endTok	31.8563190177949
startTok Secondly: a range of instruments has to be developed which allow for a flexible response and which do not force us into a situation where we need to choose between a kill or cure remedy or a complete stab in the dark. endTok	64.89781087259561
startTok The following spring to mind in this respect: the systematic collation of documentation and information, professional forms of observation, the development of information campaigns, the use of cash to support democratic forces in the country concerned, a more creative deployment of the resources which are available through multilateral diplomacy, such as organised dialogue and fact finding missions and such like. endTok	128.33478935835518
startTok Thirdly: it will need to be made clear for each of the EU institutions where the responsibility for human rights policy lies within the European Union and what the tasks and competences are that this entails. endTok	42.0462919321568
startTok The Commission and the Council will each have to decide for themselves what these might be. endTok	70.5574848062012
startTok This Parliament is excluded from this, for our Rules of Procedure stipulate that the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs carries this responsibility. endTok	61.36911176851924
startTok But I am somewhat surprised that the resolution which should bring this debate on human rights to a conclusion has been prepared in the foreign sector of this Parliament and that the aforementioned Committee, of which I form part, has not been involved in this. endTok	45.93780375045203
startTok Mr President, this Parliament is fragmented and divided. endTok	36.304349025581324
startTok For the sake of our credibility, we will have to speak with one voice when it comes to human rights and not act as if human rights within the EU are different from human rights elsewhere in the world. endTok	42.04437727387075
startTok I think that this will benefit our credibility in the UN Human Rights Committee. endTok	34.56871081624326
startTok Mr President, what will it take to make the debate on human rights something other than what it is today: an ideological instrument which helps to enslave peoples rather than free individuals? endTok	82.98419353298323
startTok We must start by going beyond man, who is not the master of the universe, to the source of all genuine rights and civilised values, without which the eternal claim to rights always ends in tyranny and bloodshed. endTok	93.34030627404651
startTok We need, in the ancient and mediaeval tradition of Europe, to go back to the natural order of the universe, i.e. to the Creation, and beyond that still further, to the Creator' s intention. endTok	50.53794728060816
startTok Then we shall see that the rights of the child are only respected within a proper family, the rights of workers are only respected in the intermediary bodies which we have recently destroyed and that citizens' rights are only respected within sovereign states. endTok	81.3710241800763
startTok Secondly, the doctrine of human rights must no longer be exploited, as it is today, as an instrument of ideological warfare in the hands of a cast which claims the right to decree unilaterally who is to be the arbiter of human rights and who is to be deprived of those rights, thereby denying the legitimacy and, if need be, the freedom of those whom the party line has deemed politically incorrect. endTok	65.17499368225882
startTok 'No freedom for the enemies of freedom' was what the advocates of the revolutionary Terror were saying two centuries ago, the advocates of the revolution which proved, alas, to be the mother of all modern totalitarian regimes. endTok	76.95576100427768
startTok No human rights for the enemies of human rights is what the acolytes of the new world order are saying today, the new world order which reigns almost unchallenged in financial circles, in international institutions, in the media and cultural networks, and in educational institutions, to mention but a few. endTok	95.07100948590647
startTok What is left, for example, of the right of Austrians to choose their own destiny, if that choice is dictated on their behalf by those who decide what should or should not be done and if their duly and legally elected leaders are received in an insulting manner, as they were recently by you in Portugal, Mr President of the Council. endTok	93.38313291354348
startTok I do not know if he is still present and can hear me. endTok	63.671409900905374
startTok What is left of the human rights of those who sympathise with the Vlaamsblok, one of the most important parties in the Flemish region, if tomorrow the Belgian Parliament adopts the implausible, indecent and ignominious bill tabled by its main political rivals, the Volksunie, which seeks quite simply to abolish the party? endTok	46.35651694638969
startTok What is left of the right to engage in a critical study of history when authors and publishers are persecuted, as the young historian Jean Plantin was just yesterday before the Court of Appeal, in my home town of Lyon - he was the subject of an absurd, arrogant and offensive closing speech by the public prosecutor Jean-Olivier Viout, the smug expression of straitjacketed thinking and intellectual conformism? endTok	68.58491710476646
startTok It is a strange concept of human rights when peaceful patriotism is fraudulently equated with aggressive nationalism, when legitimate protests against immigration policies are equated with I do not know what form of xenophobia and the vital defence of identities is equated with racism. endTok	79.70734199683538
startTok What of the human rights of the millions of French people who voted for the National Front and who are deprived of any political representation and vilified daily, as they were on Monday on the television channels of the state to which they are required to pay taxes, when the simple expression of justifiably exasperated views by one of our colleagues, Mr Le Pen, is used as a pretext for iniquitous condemnation, in violation of the law and in violation of all notions of justice, fairness and morals, and when attempts are made, in violation of the clearest legislation, to deprive this representative of millions of our fellow citizens of the mandate which he has been given by their vote, not received as a favour from the government. endTok	64.74045744759314
startTok In a word, I shall believe your talk about human rights in Europe, fellow Members, when you acknowledge that your political opponents have the same rights as you allow yourselves. endTok	104.98026227205298
startTok I shall believe your talk about human rights in China when you name the real cause of the problem, i.e. Communism. endTok	84.44737981718664
startTok Listen to the resounding voice of Solzhenitsyn in his letter to the Americans, in which he says that the main cause of the weakness of Western society is excessive pandering to legal individualism, an individualism which, far from allowing people to flourish, paves the way for future dictatorship, in fact the worst kind of dictatorship, because those whom it enslaves are not even aware of their terrible servitude. endTok	80.65129096118362
startTok Mr President, the principle of universal human rights is undoubtedly one of the most important political legacies of the 20th century. endTok	18.034249695487375
startTok The holocaust, fifty years ago, led to the need to lay down a number of fundamental rights and freedoms. endTok	37.00550991716253
startTok Since the end of the cold war, compliance with human rights has also become a condition for international cooperation. endTok	50.407791180555286
startTok Leaders violating these principles now face international criticism, sanctions and are even brought to trial, such as ex-dictators like Mr Pinochet have experienced. endTok	323.6277529206059
startTok These developments are encouraging but do not detract from the fact that the situation of human rights in the world remains very disquieting. endTok	35.061473922941545
startTok Especially in situations of war, civilians are given less consideration all the time. endTok	228.53377636069803
startTok It seems contradictory. endTok	64.67168331138464
startTok Never before in history has humanitarian right been so well developed. endTok	208.74164832129392
startTok Never before have so many international treaties been ratified by so many countries. endTok	134.4598472729444
startTok Yet the most basic rules of conduct are being flouted on a massive scale and there are more civilian victims than there were a century ago. endTok	62.56199527446972
startTok Women are systematically raped. endTok	55.91276697856967
startTok Children are conscripted by force and deployed in battle. endTok	121.4148182551934
startTok Excesses are no longer the exception, they have unfortunately become the rule. endTok	158.50397723600005
startTok This applies today to no fewer than thirty conflicts worldwide. endTok	115.86289481486506
startTok Too late, too selective and too fragmented: this is how one could describe the human rights policy of the international community. endTok	43.67711304307255
startTok First of all, the policy comes too late. endTok	50.31239732517389
startTok Both in Rwanda and Kosovo, the UN, despite the many warnings, appeared to be overtaken by events and stood by as a helpless observer of the massacres, as President Havel pointed out this afternoon. endTok	52.285129900781506
startTok Fifty years later, we are still unable to prevent genocide. endTok	38.53547099255615
startTok We should therefore direct more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention as a matter of urgency. endTok	28.887722323458856
startTok Control of the arms trade and improved media control are essential in this. endTok	99.39397815107124
startTok The human rights policy is also too selective. endTok	29.338055845465618
startTok The months of NATO bombardments of Kosovo and the mediation attempts in the Middle East are in stark contrast to international apathy with regard to the conflicts in Africa. endTok	35.58451672284455
startTok I cannot shake off the impression that, when it comes to human rights, despite all the rhetoric, Africa does not feature on top of the agenda of the Portuguese Presidency. This is something which I very much regret. endTok	27.07685629637991
startTok The impression that Africans get, namely that they are inferior world citizens, is not unfounded. endTok	95.92637688899838
startTok I would like to warn against a blurring of standards in the assessment of human rights situations in Africa, where violations are viewed as a necessary evil. endTok	31.024338663481608
startTok But above all, the human rights policy is too fragmented. endTok	26.459978208259873
startTok We are unable to draft a common strategy within the international communities or Europe. endTok	69.28823004265305
startTok Take Sudan. endTok	200.76517557513682
startTok The international community is sending conflicting messages to this country. endTok	31.71964233428412
startTok Britain has re-opened its embassy in Khartoum. endTok	99.27016547459321
startTok Canada has invited the Sudanese for peace talks. endTok	87.68593923514403
startTok Europe puts the rebels in the South under pressure to negotiate and at the same time, Americans isolate the regime and support the rebels at military level. endTok	70.97005679653563
startTok There is a need for more coordination, more exchange of information and a more coherent approach whereby any raised bids are avoided. endTok	48.91065842993858
startTok Only then can we follow in the footsteps of the founders of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. endTok	32.88712787631471
startTok Mr President, I would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home. endTok	31.780389910438327
startTok But unfortunately, as we speak today in the safety of this Chamber, human rights abuses are occurring throughout the free world. endTok	65.73348014843603
startTok Sometimes the more we speak, the less we hear - motions: words; conventions: words; treaties: words - if we are not careful, words themselves become a substitute for real action. endTok	246.30223316832087
startTok Words framed in inclusive and liberating documents become treaties and conventions which are often paraded as a testimony to a country's respect for and adherence to human rights. endTok	77.96617522189995
startTok Yet words spoken, written or signed are not in themselves enough. endTok	282.28014225480405
startTok Look at the signatories to the conventions on human rights and minorities and then compare the treatment received by such minorities, groups and individuals - the list is shameful and shaming. endTok	87.13238983366676
startTok Can anyone argue with any persuasiveness that women are treated equally and fairly, that children have human rights or that people are not discriminated against because of their religion, belief, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, opinion, political affiliation etc? endTok	92.44802679059137
startTok The defamation of minorities in newspapers and other media fuels discrimination. endTok	41.09828787487995
startTok Even within the EU citizens still suffer human rights violations and a breach of our conventions. endTok	102.74844172742894
startTok Every day in the press misinformation and misrepresentation are used to deny some minorities equality before the law and to denigrate ethnic minorities. endTok	64.38478933118385
startTok Quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created. endTok	43.736447409009365
startTok And so long as people do not have equality before the law, this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded. endTok	47.051782058073684
startTok In our enlargement process in the EU we have rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities. endTok	37.218866825358724
startTok We must not waiver in that commitment. endTok	35.36148676426536
startTok But we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies. endTok	40.4218846634271
startTok Yes, conventions have been signed, but action is needed. endTok	113.01649904380703
startTok I would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices, eternal vigilance, not just outside our borders but within. endTok	70.91373362619677
startTok That is why I would welcome an annual Member State report from each individual state which would have to record any charges against it and the action taken. Because what happens in each Member State happens to every single one of us. endTok	64.46324760355967
startTok What happens in another part of the world affects us. endTok	53.85960833810345
startTok Pinochet in Chile is as relevant as Haider in Austria. endTok	112.19893428815631
startTok Human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked. endTok	43.14282465064806
startTok Human rights do not exist in isolation, they are connected to our development policies, our economic policies, our home affairs policies, indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions. endTok	63.53578064261917
startTok I would repeat what Mr Patten said: we must engage, we must inform, educate and thereby effect real and lasting change. endTok	59.02986255431542
startTok Mr President, "Europe stands for ideals, values and principles. endTok	61.43443242273317
startTok We must emphasise Europe' s spiritual history. endTok	61.077614477930865
startTok Together, we must re-establish the values which unite Europe. endTok	79.27719860129235
startTok Spiritual values have been disseminated from Europe throughout the globe. endTok	46.69899209358213
startTok We must live with our consciences." endTok	29.561474805604217
startTok These were the words spoken three hours ago in this Chamber by the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel. endTok	38.92990472920438
startTok In an extraordinarily edifying speech, characterised by wisdom, historical knowledge, an understanding of the human heart and insight into Europe' s spiritual and Christian heritage, he pointed to sources of inspiration for our work on human justice and human dignity. endTok	84.32324544708618
startTok We should be grateful that there are Heads of State like Vaclav Havel in our Europe. endTok	63.06416128883185
startTok I wish to discuss two matters. endTok	52.9232496830942
startTok First of all, civil society. endTok	31.487298606689592
startTok Vaclav Havel stated that, in Eastern Europe, the Communist regimes methodically destroyed civil society: national movements, churches and the independent trade unions. endTok	126.99451130993734
startTok The same is happening in China in connection with the Falun Gong movement and with the Catholic and Protestant churches. endTok	37.48973147329397
startTok It is happening with Buddhism in Tibet. endTok	42.58522159860953
startTok We must never forget to defend civil society. endTok	38.07938252601987
startTok I also want to mention the death penalty. endTok	14.130926100815698
startTok Like my own country, Sweden, the EU bases its view of human beings upon the equal, unique and inviolable value of every human. endTok	85.53865769060668
startTok On the basis of this principle, human beings should always have the chance to redeem themselves. endTok	25.25869772684927
startTok Try telling that to the governments of the United States, Russia and China. endTok	68.38672443386147
startTok Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, I believe the approach of EU Member States at Geneva should be to prioritise the situations in Kosovo, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone and China. endTok	43.89012735760348
startTok In relation to China, we should not be dissuaded from raising the issue simply because discussions on it may be blocked. endTok	70.75356734950385
startTok However, it is imperative that the EU speaks and acts as one, and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve. endTok	87.96002568842215
startTok However, if full expression is to be given to the decisions which may eventually be taken at Geneva, then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be provided with the necessary resources. endTok	39.916137515837775
startTok The financial resources of the United Nations are spread very thinly and because of this many crucial programmes are dependent on voluntary contributions to keep them afloat. endTok	51.61702040702077
startTok Resources are also needed for promoting practical cooperation and human rights, strategic planning, the establishment of priorities and strengthening communications between the donor community and member states of the United Nations. endTok	65.00218167659297
startTok To this end the High Commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for USD 53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks. endTok	84.19796863150377
startTok The European Union and its Member States should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds. endTok	29.472241055855008
startTok In so doing, we would not only embarrass the United States into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to UN funding, but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric. endTok	46.22876345730967
startTok Mr President, this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual UN Human Rights Convention and the Commission' s and Council' s efforts in this respect. endTok	41.04071250085977
startTok I would first of all like to say that I am very pleased with the contributions made by Mr Patten and the Minister, and I welcome the fact that both China and Cuba are on the agenda. endTok	21.66599354628751
startTok Cuba is the last stronghold of dictatorship in South America and we must be mindful of this, with all due sympathy to Cuba. endTok	63.704147358109665
startTok It is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy. endTok	68.64325284110672
startTok I would, during my two minutes, like to draw attention to two countries which are close to my heart. endTok	45.58850752587278
startTok The first country is Indonesia. endTok	49.23669154465281
startTok We are naturally delighted that Indonesia is under new rule and that Mr Wahid and Mrs Sukarnoputri are the new President and Vice-President. endTok	53.7273148094346
startTok We are also pleased that the situation in Timor is slowly moving in the right direction. endTok	23.45904261032938
startTok But I can report that in the Moluccas, an area just north of Timor, the violence is still not under control. endTok	103.36619842386268
startTok This has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years. endTok	46.87054592972402
startTok Tens of thousands of people are on the run. endTok	29.961902634141254
startTok The situation is badly managed. endTok	40.832550527948555
startTok I know that tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, an important programme will be shown on Dutch television, in which an appeal will be made for observers. This is with the sole purpose of monitoring what exactly is going on, so that at least a record can be made, not least for the future, for human rights committees, of what has been happening. endTok	79.34269925347894
startTok My urgent request, which has been echoed many times in resolutions, is the following: could you not confer so that observers can be sent to the Moluccas? endTok	45.17245546761424
startTok Surely thousands of people killed, thousands wounded and tens of thousands on the run is enough. endTok	72.72557393193777
startTok My second country - I will be brief as Mr Patten knows this country very well - is Burma. endTok	85.18344032930001
startTok Surely we cannot just keep silent about Burma. endTok	108.74330622489273
startTok I have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion. endTok	25.419226063261075
startTok For ten years now, the elected President of that country has been under house arrest. endTok	54.97223876661045
startTok And for ten years now, its parliament has been out of action. endTok	68.29189708591406
startTok Numerous MPs have been killed or have fled the country and only a few are left in Burma. endTok	80.50282786957168
startTok There are hundreds of thousands of refugees in Thailand and India from Burma and yet it seems that that country is no longer given any attention. endTok	32.65799535409874
startTok In my opinion, Burma should be put back on the agenda, too, certainly in the wake of Indonesia' s U-turn. endTok	51.6028084064688
startTok Surely we cannot tolerate the fact that Mrs Aung San Sui Kyi feels completely left in the lurch, even by Europe. endTok	35.025363607022484
startTok My request is, in fact, to put this country back on the top of the agenda. endTok	42.92404152224912
startTok Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, economic clout cannot be the only factor that determines the European Union' s status in the world. endTok	24.74721150588331
startTok One of the EU' s distinguishing features is our systematic approach to human rights, as exercised both within the Union and by our partners. endTok	56.32045747657173
startTok The European Parliament has been at the forefront of the battle to promote and defend human rights, and it has succeeded in overcoming the limits imposed by self-interest and "national interests" , which are sometimes reflected in the positions adopted by the Member States and even by other European Union institutions. endTok	46.323570835411104
startTok We can therefore safely say, for example, that the European Parliament has never allowed the situation in East Timor to be forgotten, which could have been the greatest obstacle to finding an equitable solution for its people, who always opposed occupation by Indonesia. endTok	59.691066949245375
startTok By the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to Indonesia, a stance that the Council unfortunately did not take into account. endTok	69.19258155189195
startTok But it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to sickening instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position. endTok	58.68180579535434
startTok It is vital that when violations are committed, the perpetrators should not be able to act with impunity, whoever or wherever they may be - in Indonesia or Angola, in Cuba, China or Burma, whether the perpetrators are civilians or soldiers, humble foot-soldier or general or even a minister. endTok	107.71138407606749
startTok Justice needs to be done in Indonesia. endTok	54.7664872687898
startTok Justice needs to be done in East Timor. endTok	59.72617204688273
startTok President Wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with. endTok	101.5030709924783
startTok The specific reference in this resolution to East Timor, on the initiative of the PPE Group, is a timely one. endTok	88.89071415158115
startTok Someone must be held to account for the events that took place there, some of which I saw with my own eyes as a representative of this House; they cannot go unpunished. endTok	65.6668135927717
startTok It is impossible to talk about East Timor without mentioning the tens of thousands of Timorese refugees living on Indonesian soil in inhumane conditions, under the control of Indonesian soldiers and militias, and being used as bargaining chips. endTok	43.3057849707331
startTok This is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency. endTok	20.46556573181891
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok (PT) Mr President, I would like to make a few very brief comments on behalf of the Council presidency, and first to remind you that the work done by the presidency is above all about coordination and about seeking common positions on initiatives that the fifteen Member States are to approve in the Council. Our experience of previous sessions of the Human Rights Commission suggests - precisely by virtue of this coordinating role played by successive presidencies - that the European Union is very much able to uphold its status as a body with its own policy within the Commission, and it is important to maintain this. endTok	45.054033784749976
startTok I would also like to say that the European Parliament' s participation in the preparatory work is important in establishing coherent European Union positions on various different issues, and that the presidency therefore naturally welcomes all the various suggestions and in particular all the contributions made through the resolutions which have been presented. endTok	43.98849647118012
startTok I would also like to stress, as many Members have highlighted, that human rights policy is at the heart of Europe' s identity and that respect for human rights should be seen as a fundamental principle for international cooperation by the European Union. endTok	26.25725128109213
startTok Hence the need for the most coherent European human rights policy possible, which of course means that we need to adopt clear and unambiguous positions where we consider a state of affairs to be unacceptable, and I have in mind, in particular, the references that many Members have made to China. endTok	66.20738011187139
startTok But we have also duly noted the concerns expressed by many other Members about other countries, notably Indonesia, East Timor, the Moluccas and Burma. endTok	107.8689714260164
startTok I could not conclude without mentioning Mr Van Hecke' s speech in particular, in which he referred to the human rights situation in Africa and to the role and priorities of the Portuguese Presidency, and questioned the sincerity of the priority we are giving to relations with the European Union. endTok	37.7338577698043
startTok I would simply like to say that the Portuguese Presidency has, in these two short months, organised the first Development Council, admittedly an informal one, whose agenda was rightly dominated by EU-Africa relations. Indeed it was this subject which led the development ministers of the fifteen Member States to meet in Lisbon for discussions specifically on the new era these relations have entered. endTok	92.12173109791776
startTok Furthermore, I cannot stress enough the significance of our having concluded important negotiations on the new convention to succeed the Lomé Convention, and the fact that, following extremely complex and difficult negotiations, we have succeeded in organising - or making preparations for the organisation of - the first EU-Africa Summit. endTok	126.73511374286105
startTok For all these reasons I thought it essential to reply directly to Mr Van Hecke' s question on this issue. endTok	29.76260826920382
startTok . Mr President, this has been a very useful debate. endTok	14.124307418329925
startTok One or two speeches have referred to specific issues which we are well advised to think about very carefully. endTok	48.275677028604115
startTok For example, Mrs Maij-Weggen referred to both Indonesia and Burma and made some important points about both those countries and the human rights situation there. endTok	71.85211457999199
startTok What I would like to focus on very briefly are one or two themes which ran through our debate. endTok	49.958106676419995
startTok One of the very first speakers, Mr Wuori, spoke of the remarks made earlier today by Mr Havel. endTok	48.56946924324517
startTok It was a remarkable speech and I hope that Mr Gollnisch, who is no longer able to be with us, was able to hear that speech as well. endTok	50.91006400216016
startTok I also hope that, if there is any life in outer space, as has been speculated by Mr Newton Dunn, it was tuned in to Mr Havel' s speech as well. endTok	36.713048907378386
startTok Mr Havel reminded us that the Union is not just about markets, about GDP growth, it is a Union of values that is reflected in the Treaties and is reflected in our obligations in the whole area of external assistance, reflected quite specifically in what we are charged to do. endTok	74.91204539347387
startTok How do we implement what the Treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes? endTok	141.81042613756273
startTok One or two honourable Members, Mr Ferber and Mr Cushnahan, spoke about the gap between rhetoric and reality. endTok	28.22927187642168
startTok Mr Cashman said, which is right in a sense, that words are no substitute for real action. endTok	56.591733463927824
startTok Of course, words can make a bit of a difference, a point that was made by Mrs Malmström. endTok	74.04201213997345
startTok She said that she had received a letter from the Chinese Ambassador, a very amiable and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country, to tell her that she was wrong and the European Parliament was wrong in its attitude on human rights in China. endTok	52.537695624383716
startTok I think after her speech she will receive a cascade of letters from the Chinese authorities. endTok	59.16106351775379
startTok She will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters about what is claimed to be the real situation in China. endTok	41.140943684333195
startTok I think she was reflecting the views of many non-governmental organisations, many people who admire Chinese civilisation but are concerned about what is happening in China today. endTok	58.37202983675959
startTok Of course it is entirely right that we have to look at action, and the very first speech by Mr Salafranca mentioned two issues apart from Geneva which represent actions, one of which is of course made possible by the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of the European taxpayer - that is the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities - about EUR 100 million that is spent through programmes, for which I am responsible, mainly going to non-governmental organisations to promote human rights and to promote democratisation. endTok	52.71203249107963
startTok We will want to share with Parliament, as vicars say, our views on how that spending programme to support human rights can be best focused and best targeted in the years ahead. endTok	96.8280315879346
startTok There is also the question which was referred to by Mr Salafranca, who I am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate. endTok	40.04468694258724
startTok There is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy. endTok	23.73542324765577
startTok I want to remind Parliament that the Commission will be publishing, before the middle of the year, a comprehensive, intellectual case for placing human rights at the heart of the development of the common foreign and security policy. endTok	27.181322109611553
startTok It is immensely important, and if I had not thought that already, having listened to the remarkable speech by Mr Havel earlier in the day I would have certainly come to that conclusion. endTok	80.59239553616709
startTok It has been a useful debate. endTok	22.68371708212754
startTok I hope we can have further debates like this. endTok	77.56510210780459
startTok I hope we can have, in particular, debates about some of the ways in which we translate these good intentions into practice on the ground where it matters, where people are still being tortured, where people are still being raped and are still being denied the sort of civil rights that this House takes for granted, as I do. endTok	69.57188898700643
startTok I have received 7 motions for resolution, pursuant to Rule 37(2), to close the present statement. endTok	55.94482302875298
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place on Thursday. endTok	8.454181725060234
startTok Cyprus and Malta endTok	214.67707084995348
startTok The next item is the joint debate on: endTok	8.673499649839501
startTok the Council statement on the position of the European Union on developments concerning Cyprus; endTok	50.63259781216708
startTok the report (A4-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta [COM(1999)0535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS)]. endTok	6.660570007719177
startTok Mr Seixas da Costa has the floor on behalf of the Council. endTok	9.836745797067767
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I would like to present to you certain information about the re-opening of the intra-Cyprus negotiations and recent developments in this area. endTok	28.555084532036645
startTok I think it will be obvious to everyone that the events in Helsinki at the end of last year and the new era in relations between the European Union and Turkey have created a new backdrop, at Community level, which we cannot ignore when it comes to relations between the two Cypriot communities. endTok	29.036956306590035
startTok At the beginning of December 1999, the first round of negotiations were held in New York, after an interruption of several years in negotiations between the Cypriot communities in the north and south of the island. endTok	40.02091143660338
startTok These negotiations took the form of indirect discussions mediated by the UN special representative, Álvaro de Soto. endTok	107.12429253584044
startTok A further round was held in January this year, starting on 31 January, and a third round is scheduled to start on 23 May in New York. endTok	104.51255951992606
startTok There is a possibility, which has not yet been absolutely confirmed, that continuous and direct discussions may take place, with work continuing until September this year. endTok	114.5320549996692
startTok These discussions essentially cover four areas: security, the structure of government, territorial adjustments and issues relating to refugees and compensation, as a result of the situation following the partition of the island. endTok	99.11521476679741
startTok However, agreement has also been reached on the possibility of including other issues, and the representative of the northern part of the island, Rauf Denktash, has suggested three new topics: sovereignty, confidence-building measures and the issue of lifting the embargo on products from the north of the island. endTok	78.60847686526581
startTok The discussions held so far have essentially resulted in two developments. The first is the possibility of opening up a direct information channel between the European Union and the north of the island, without this necessarily signifying recognition of this part of the island as a legal personality at international level, but as a means of facilitating adoption of the acquis communautaire with a view to eventual accession of the whole island, if a solution can, in the meantime, be found to the broader problem of the partition of the island. endTok	56.261057187791245
startTok The second development which we regard as important is the statement made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the end of the first day' s discussions to the effect that an overall settlement of the situation would involve recognition of the specific situation of the north of the island. endTok	46.16145830426058
startTok This is the position of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and it will therefore have to form part of our future analysis. endTok	26.753969213884723
startTok Certain expectations exist about the third round of negotiations, in view of the proposed scenarios being prepared with the involvement of representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom, in particular in the areas of security and the constitutional structure, which it is envisaged will be presented at this round through the good offices of the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. endTok	54.21490784305208
startTok This will take place after the election in the north of the island scheduled for 18 April. endTok	59.24292966897337
startTok Furthermore, the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union has decided, following the example of previous presidencies, to appoint a representative to establish contacts with the various parties involved in this issue. endTok	34.92374136617429
startTok This representative has already contacted all these parties and has, in close cooperation with the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, been monitoring and assisting with the work of the various rounds. endTok	45.075640560467235
startTok In particular, we intend that the European Union should maintain a constant profile on this issue, and of course all the more so since Cyprus is a candidate for membership of the European Union with negotiations at a fairly advanced stage. This naturally raises certain expectations and means that the role of the European Union is of some relevance in this context. endTok	56.895561175730116
startTok The approach that we have been following in these discussions, and our participation in them, essentially turns on taking advantage of a certain desire to alleviate the tensions that exist, based on a conviction - which appears to be widely shared - that it is necessary to continue to negotiate, and that continuing negotiations and maintaining their impetus also give rise to hopes that a definitive solution can be found. endTok	75.04350616069776
startTok There is also another important aspect which I referred to at the beginning of my statement, and this relates to Turkey' s role in helping the north of the island to prepare for accession. endTok	43.25719228204551
startTok We believe that it is not only necessary to read the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council with some care and attention, but that we should also take advantage of the willingness of the Turkish authorities to help to resolve this situation. endTok	41.60389363648644
startTok I was able to talk to Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit about this issue when I visited Ankara myself, and although we are aware of the difficulties and sensitivity associated with Turkey' s particular approach to this question, I believe that there is a window of opportunity that we must not miss. endTok	46.397561076136476
startTok This window of opportunity involves combining various factors, one of which - and let us be frank about this - is the nature of the relationship between Turkey and the European Union. endTok	47.90563466429607
startTok This is key as regards the future of this issue. endTok	42.46273838158797
startTok On the other hand, we think it is important - and this is also linked with the way in which the European Union relates to the heart of this matter - that an exchange of information between the Commission and the Cypriots in the north of the island should be encouraged. This would not, let me make this quite clear, imply any kind of formal recognition. endTok	34.85375268175488
startTok Nevertheless, we believe, and I think this is also how the Commission sees things, that the whole process of approximation with the acquis communautaire with a view to overall integration of the island in the European Union through accession at some point in the future implies involving the communities in the north of the island as soon as possible. It may also give the European Union access to data enabling it to justify accession, as part of its efforts to assess accession conditions. endTok	62.55244979985794
startTok Furthermore, this means that we in the Council - and I think that Parliament will join us in this - should encourage the Commission' s involvement in this undertaking. endTok	39.40127137794499
startTok It is essential for us to send the Commission a message of confidence about its role in this area. endTok	34.51796199101881
startTok Lastly, I believe - and this is also the presidency' s intention - that we should continue to cooperate actively with the United Nations, given the skilful, intelligent and capable way in which the Secretary-General, and the UN organisation in general, have conducted these discussions, and in particular the way they have endeavoured to help to harmonise the two parties' positions. endTok	63.41105250392049
startTok As I said at the beginning, the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council last December have had a visible impact on the way the positions of the various parties to this process have developed. endTok	45.64838146464686
startTok The Nicosia Government has expressed its satisfaction with the Helsinki conclusions, which open up the way to accession to the European Union without solving the partition of the island beforehand. endTok	48.99986630966231
startTok Nevertheless, I have to say that the same authorities have expressed their concern about the pressure they may come under to resolve the issues raised by partition, which will evidently imply some concessions. endTok	66.32603217671596
startTok This is related to developments in the sphere of displaced people and the possibility of a new arrangement regarding displaced people should a different solution be found for the island. endTok	70.89179153876164
startTok On the other hand, the Turkish Cypriots fear - and there is no point in trying to conceal this - that Turkey' s application for membership of the European Union may lead to greater flexibility in Ankara' s position on this. endTok	37.6640649385488
startTok I believe that, despite the fears that may be felt by the two communities on the island, these points, which could be viewed in a negative light by the authorities on both sides, may in the end justify hopes of an ultimate solution. endTok	72.32976232575109
startTok It is very clear that this solution will involve one of the most important aspects of relations in this area at present, which is the extremely positive trend in relations between Athens and Ankara and the very important part played in these relations by the Greek Foreign Minister, Giorgios Papandreou, and the Turkish Foreign Minister, Ismail Cem. endTok	43.63749748529849
startTok We believe that this has created the framework for a positive outcome. endTok	38.388722405236116
startTok As far as we, the Council presidency, are concerned, we will continue to follow these developments very closely, and we will certainly cooperate with the Secretary-General and his personal representative on this matter. endTok	45.03375798356977
startTok We will make the Community institutions aware of what we are able to do, and what is possible in general, as regards coordination, not just at political level but also as regards what the Commission itself can achieve in terms of its scope for managing the accession process. endTok	49.10528540866244
startTok In particular, we will make known the flexibility that both parties have demonstrated on this issue. endTok	86.45683493559542
startTok Mr President, we have listened to the statements by the Council and the Commission and I would like to make the following observations. endTok	15.336656745829151
startTok Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I appreciate the sensitivity with which you are addressing the issue and your effort to establish contact with the Turkish Cypriot side, but perhaps it would be more clear and more correct if the vocabulary you use did not leave one suspecting that you might be attempting some kind of indirect recognition, even though you stressed that this is not the case. endTok	60.95835148096756
startTok For example, I would not refer to the government of Nicosia. endTok	21.566506395889913
startTok It is the Cypriot Government, Mr President-in-Office, not the government of Nicosia. endTok	47.754173002993475
startTok That government has proposed a way in which the Turkish Cypriot side can take part, and I think it would be right for the Council and the Commission to urge the Turkish Cypriot side to take part institutionally in the framework of the negotiations conducted by the Republic of Cyprus. endTok	38.37408106258914
startTok On the other hand, the way that the issue of the end of the protocols and the pre-accession strategy has been addressed so far creates some doubts for us. endTok	44.190416238280264
startTok I cannot understand why the two small countries must be treated differently, nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies. endTok	125.34033944551982
startTok Nor can I understand the pressure applied by Parliament to include the funds in Chapter 7 for the pre-accession strategy. How can the whole of the European Union treat, in this way, two small countries situated on its periphery? endTok	71.6362136448106
startTok Not only are they countries which the European Union needs, but they are also countries which are fully qualified to operate within the Union and are already considered capable of participating in economic and monetary union. endTok	71.07866842149146
startTok As the Commissioner said, and I agree with him, it is a matter of political decision. endTok	17.26619582284075
startTok This is a small political decision which would bring major benefits, especially in helping the two communities effectively to constitute one state, to achieve effective rapprochement - because the two communities were once close - and for the Republic of Cyprus, genuinely, to be rid of occupying forces. endTok	94.40999996362436
startTok Mr President, we are required under the advisory procedure to debate a proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations within the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta. endTok	23.645802060757
startTok This proposal is similar to the proposal submitted for other candidate countries and, once it is implemented, will replace the financial protocols which have now expired. endTok	53.5148534258331
startTok Pre-accession instruments are designed to provide technical and financial support for efforts by candidate countries to meet the demands of the Community acquis. endTok	61.55574222467305
startTok The Commission' s analysis has in fact shown that, although classified as high income countries by the World Bank, Cyprus and Malta have the same difficulties as the CEECs in transposing Community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity. endTok	75.7267352165315
startTok It was pointed out, during the discussion of Mr Brok' s excellent report in committee, that both countries can also benefit from the MEDA budget line for horizontal projects of regional interest. endTok	81.67629750337801
startTok I would be grateful if the Commissioner could explicitly confirm that. endTok	23.647871149938094
startTok As far as Cyprus is concerned, part of the technical and financial aid provided for in the instruments will be used to bring the Greek and Turkish communities closer together and solve the problem of the partition of the island once and for all. endTok	59.6601642216045
startTok The declarations made on the Cyprus question by the Council and the Commission were therefore most opportune and I should like to thank the President of the Council and Commissioner Verheugen. endTok	23.22376649625877
startTok Since 4 July 1990, when Cyprus applied to join the EU, the European Parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations. endTok	73.556143596523
startTok In April 1999, Parliament again reiterated its position that the accession of Cyprus should benefit the whole island, and help towards a political solution, but that accession should not be dependent upon such a solution. endTok	97.36640150172376
startTok In other words, accession should not be held hostage to a political solution. endTok	54.703978271713225
startTok The two processes are separate processes. endTok	292.3674546250411
startTok This unequivocal position on the part of the European Parliament gave rise to a certain degree of controversy. endTok	20.88128716413098
startTok We must therefore welcome the fact that the Helsinki European Council put an end to the speculation and stated in its conclusions, and I quote, that "If no settlement has been reached by the completion of accession negotiations, the Council' s decision on accession will be made without the above being a precondition" . endTok	51.316831553833374
startTok The position is clear and we must now hope that the improved climate surrounding relations between the European Union and Turkey and between Greece and Turkey will bear favourably on the Turkish Cypriot community and that it will withdraw its refusal to send representatives to the accession negotiations. endTok	79.2794289691975
startTok The presence of these representatives will not prejudge the final political solution in any way whatsoever. endTok	67.17439041812186
startTok On the contrary, it will allow the interests of all concerned to be highlighted as and when Cyprus joins the European Union and prepares for a turning point in its history. endTok	59.99788610310717
startTok Mr President, I want to say that I share the other rapporteurs' delight at the fact that better opportunities are now to be glimpsed for making further progress in Cyprus in the light of the improvement in relations between Turkey and the EU and between Turkey and Greece. endTok	32.88620266285818
startTok However, I also think that we in the EU should be making a constructive contribution. endTok	33.67677766699949
startTok I also think - as has already been mentioned - that there are certain problems with the financing arrangements, which we must solve. endTok	41.16708253531751
startTok There is, of course, the question of pre-accession aid, and this belongs in category seven. endTok	55.8174276160914
startTok Last year, Parliament made an exception by agreeing that this expenditure should be placed in category four, and the two applicant States are not therefore being treated on an equal footing with the applicant States from Central and Eastern Europe, as they, in fact, should be, according to the declarations from the Helsinki Summit. endTok	55.20563361157109
startTok Resources should therefore be set aside from category seven, where a review of the financial perspectives must be carried out. endTok	47.757770950862195
startTok This is the crux of the matter. endTok	12.729279104883364
startTok The main point is that the money for Cyprus' s and Malta' s pre-accession aid should come from category seven and that there should be a review of the financial perspectives for, if the Council does not endorse this view, it is in reality acting in conflict with its own decisions in Helsinki in December. endTok	58.25585534318011
startTok With regard to the amount which is quoted in the Brok report (EUR 130 million), I also want to say, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, that we must negotiate our way towards finding a sum of money. endTok	23.9223068158019
startTok The most important thing is that a multi-annual programme be guaranteed, and in the correct category, so that it might be possible to begin making plans where Cyprus and Malta are concerned. endTok	75.57245302720358
startTok Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support the decision adopted by the European Council in Helsinki according to which the resolution of the conflict cannot be a prior condition for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. endTok	23.901834232029675
startTok We should continue to exert strong pressure on the Government of Cyprus, but one section of the population cannot blackmail the wish of the majority. Besides, we have strong doubts as to how representative the government is of that part of the island is. endTok	83.49633846287846
startTok It is clear that the window of opportunity mentioned by the presidency should be exploited to the full. endTok	37.49603346811352
startTok But we are also convinced that, despite improved relations between the Turkish and Greek populations, it is not enough. endTok	63.64928065550948
startTok The conflict in Cyprus will only be resolved through improved relations between the two communities with a view to establishing a federation in the - we hope - not too distant future. endTok	85.11271205581349
startTok In particular, we should be working towards establishing genuine freedom of movement and resolving the problems of demilitarising and disarming the island. endTok	45.07012775320681
startTok The European Union should be taking a more decisive role that goes further than merely providing financial support, although that is important, by promoting and guaranteeing reconciliation between the two communities through the setting up of fora and confidence-building programmes. endTok	96.34453745039453
startTok I must say that Alex Langer's presence here in the European Parliament is sadly missed. His efforts to build peace should serve as an example, to all of us, on how peaceful coexistence can be achieved. endTok	55.85108015762224
startTok Mr President, the reference to dialogue between the two Cypriot communities under the aegis of the UNO reminds us of the fact that, 26 years after the invasion of the island by the Turkish army, nearly 40% of the territory is still occupied by 35 000 soldiers, heavy weaponry is still being used and over 50 000 colonists are still present, in total violation of the resolutions by the Security Council of the United Nations on this matter. endTok	49.538139245182094
startTok What can the European Union do, without interfering in internal affairs in Cyprus, to promote a fair and viable solution to this drastic problem in a country which has been associated with the European Community for nearly 30 years and which is due to join the Union within the next few years? endTok	42.27139365136174
startTok I have listened to the somewhat equivocal talk and silences on the part of the Council which, in my view, need clarifying. endTok	37.3796668767212
startTok I think that we need, first and foremost, to bear the main point of reference for any international community in such cases in mind, i.e. the resolutions of the United Nations. endTok	43.80227408145374
startTok The Security Council feels that the solution to the Cypriot problem should be sought within the framework of a two-zone, twin-community federation, in other words a single state, as Mr Verheugen mentioned, consisting of two local administrations elected by the two communities. endTok	88.19833028008888
startTok Cyprus should be one sovereign state, with a single international personality and single citizenship and this state should be demilitarised. endTok	68.66302560712688
startTok The international community has thus indicated that it rejects any act accomplished by force. endTok	69.59209516799733
startTok Secondly, the European Union stands to gain, in my view, by minimising the scope for interpretation of the position laid down by the Helsinki European Council. endTok	42.00987825025218
startTok The solution to the Cypriot problem cannot be a precondition to Cyprus' s accession to the Union, as Mr Poos has reminded us. endTok	59.44803431819999
startTok If it were, Turkey would have a sort of right of veto over the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, which is, of course, unacceptable. endTok	44.730990924448285
startTok Thirdly, we must not, in turn, allow the position taken by the Helsinki European Council to temper our efforts to resolve the Cypriot question before Cyprus joins the Union. endTok	52.35260061891984
startTok From this point of view, the other decision taken at Helsinki, namely to grant Turkey candidate status, gives the Fifteen new responsibilities as well as new possibilities and its dialogue with Ankara can and, in my view, should, include a determination to ensure that Turkey demonstrates a constructive attitude towards dialogue between the two Cypriot communities which respects international law and which will ultimately lead to a united Cyprus and peace in the eastern Mediterranean. endTok	85.105488249519
startTok Mr President, there is a general consensus of opinion that financial aid to Cyprus and Malta is important. endTok	50.68070243746004
startTok The big question, however, is from what budget heading should this aid be financed? endTok	319.1312910024652
startTok The Council and Commission have suggested deleting the protocols under category 4. endTok	113.25624220162607
startTok This is in line with the budget order issued by Parliament in December last. endTok	63.2052029790781
startTok The rapporteur is now making reference to this and proposes classing Cyprus and Malta under category 7. endTok	82.49855365387289
startTok The Committee on Budgetary Control has even suggested postponing approval of the Brok report until the Council agrees to increase the financial ceilings for category 7. endTok	68.46806783599708
startTok This is an extremely risky strategy. endTok	27.759010114495865
startTok In fact, the financial protocols cannot go ahead without a vote in Parliament. endTok	56.670395508607825
startTok Cyprus and Malta will thus become the victims of a political game between the Council and Parliament regarding the height of the ceilings. endTok	42.57821653028635
startTok Moreover, what is the real significance of financial ceilings if they are increased for every new action? endTok	61.50398695145778
startTok I would therefore advocate that the EUR 15 million in category 4 be dropped, in line with the Commission' s proposal. endTok	31.713441647745952
startTok A multiannual budget of the Commission later on in the year, may give a decisive answer regarding credits for the coming years. endTok	82.74253628515645
startTok Mr President, all over the world work is being done to resolve long-standing conflicts and bring together communities divided by history and by old tribal enmities and hatreds. endTok	130.03691290324653
startTok Now is the time to devote our time and energy to aiding Cypriots from both sides of the "green line" in finding a solution to a conflict which has lasted for far too long. endTok	72.41075453747969
startTok We all know that special care is needed to ensure that Cyprus is brought successfully into the European Union, and the decisions taken at Helsinki give an added dimension to this debate, with the acceptance of Turkey as a candidate country. endTok	56.117017985746536
startTok I hope that the decisions taken at Helsinki lead to progress on the Cyprus issue. endTok	33.404730101657634
startTok I hope this signals a new era of hope for Cyprus. endTok	67.37141470257126
startTok I hope that Turkey begins to play a constructive role in the Cyprus issue. endTok	40.53562995220577
startTok I am delighted to hear the words of support from the Council and the Commission for the UN and the work it is doing in encouraging proximity talks between the two communities to encourage reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust between the two communities in Cyprus. endTok	37.83836106519178
startTok I very much welcome the Commission's support for that bizonal, bicommunal, federal Cyprus for which the UN has campaigned for so long and which both the Greek Cypriot side and the Turkish Cypriot side should be working hard to bring about. endTok	53.9289436731712
startTok I welcome the renewed warmth in relations between the Greek Government and the Turkish Government. endTok	40.06263052118777
startTok I hope that has an encouraging effect on the Cyprus talks. endTok	55.6665073689752
startTok I hope that the accession money available to assist Cyprus is used partly to promote that reconciliation and rebuilding of trust and that both sides of the divided communities in Cyprus accept and use that money in the spirit in which it is given. endTok	101.00456465754978
startTok We all, throughout the European institutions - in Parliament, the Council and the Commission - should be doing our best to aid Cyprus in its quest to reach a peaceful solution which brings together these two communities which have been divided for too many years. endTok	65.11274340062782
startTok Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, the regulation on accession aid is not exactly an advertisement for coherent work on the part of the Commission. endTok	18.242877653834473
startTok Rather, the way in which these aid measures have been cobbled together smacks of amateurism to me. endTok	73.27534993590001
startTok This applies both in terms of the substance and the financial aspect. endTok	39.51402883957731
startTok In my view, it will hardly enable us to present the accession activities conducted by the Union to the citizens of Cyprus and Malta as evidence of the fact that it is worth their while joining. endTok	44.856733499940454
startTok As Vaclav Havel rightly said today, the European Union will be judged on its political qualities according to what it can do for the individual. endTok	38.63109425151983
startTok As far as the citizens are concerned, it is what a regulation can do for them that matters. endTok	58.369385671131305
startTok We will not exactly win any awards with this regulation as far as that is concerned. endTok	44.033438124564604
startTok It is makeshift and contains heteronomous paragraphs, which is no way to set a shining example. endTok	66.3600079696014
startTok The quality of an aid package is assessed according to the following criteria: is it decentralised, is it transparent, is it accessible to the citizens and does it work? endTok	118.5647576714935
startTok Nonetheless, as far as the divided island of Cyprus is concerned, overall, this pre-accession strategy is bound up with a major political challenge. endTok	98.57328535953377
startTok In my view, it is the task of the European Union to employ all instruments, including this one, so as to contribute towards resolving the conflict on the island by political means. endTok	50.361614560005876
startTok I must take this opportunity to say that it is precisely the amendment submitted by the European Parliament that is so important to me in this respect. endTok	16.85395652389054
startTok Both the Commission and the Council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well. endTok	48.073883958537635
startTok I am delighted that we are all heading in the same direction in this respect. endTok	18.26355355573999
startTok I believe it would truly be preferable to secure a peaceful resolution to the problems in Cyprus before admitting this country to the European Union. endTok	51.33775747441601
startTok Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the view of the Greek Communist Party is that the main problem of Cyprus is not its accession to the European Union but the occupation of 40% of its territory by Turkey, which has continued for 26 years. endTok	39.396048662820085
startTok Regardless of the national origin of each Cypriot, the future of the Cypriot people must involve the unity of that small country. endTok	86.03780369328199
startTok The only acceptable solution that guarantees the future, that leaves no room for foreign interventions, like those that led to all the problems of the last fifty years, is a unified and federal Cyprus in accordance with the resolutions of the UN' s Security Council. endTok	76.99459449671538
startTok The key to solving the Cyprus problem is in the hands of the Turkish Government, which supports and encourages the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leader Raouf Denktaº. endTok	57.73688835753005
startTok For its part, the European Union, with its hypocritical professions of interest in freedom and human rights, has never been moved by the drama of the Cypriot people, by the problem of Greek and Turkish Cypriot refugees, by the enforced change of the population composition in the north of Cyprus, or by the wholesale settlement of colonists by Turkey in the occupied areas. endTok	67.51565037463844
startTok Even in this Chamber, the Council' s representative referred to the north of Cyprus and not to the occupied territories. endTok	46.14466658565503
startTok The recent Helsinki decision to grant Turkey accession country status, even though it has made not the slightest concession over the issue of its occupation of Cyprus, for example, by reducing its military presence there or giving back Ammokhostos, is clearly encouraging Turkey' s intransigence. endTok	191.46699476261296
startTok It is not by chance that, immediately after Helsinki, the Turkish Prime Minister, Bulent Ecevit, stated that the Cyprus issue had been resolved in 1974. endTok	47.68154337293781
startTok Encouraging Turkish intransigence certainly does not help to bring the two communities closer together in the intimate talks under the aegis of the UN Secretary General. endTok	82.83747930641933
startTok On their course towards accession, the people of Cyprus have already lost a great deal, but stand to lose even more. endTok	212.4157211504879
startTok The application of the acquis communautaire has created serious problems for the Cypriot economy, especially in agriculture. It entails the liquidation of the public sector, and it dislocates and destroys the developed system of social solidarity that exists in Cyprus. endTok	55.21608526749877
startTok Mr President, I beg your pardon, but the French interpreter made a small error, on the most sensitive word in the debate, during the translation of what Mr Alyssandrakis just said. endTok	50.57627821962548
startTok I just want to ensure that there is no ambiguity. endTok	15.830486690742914
startTok Mr Alyssandrakis was translated as saying "the confederate solution would be best" . endTok	69.48552316514925
startTok Obviously, he said "the federal solution would be best" . endTok	180.74579189949336
startTok It is a most important point and needs to be clarified, Mr President. endTok	35.10003151288948
startTok Thank you very much for the clarification Mr Wurtz. endTok	38.25569180584689
startTok Mr President, Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland Europe. endTok	44.077952785746554
startTok The Maltese in particular have been very good at surviving in hostile geographical and geopolitical environments. endTok	41.533448088958664
startTok Their success has relied in great part on their enterprise, their dynamism and their flexibility. endTok	136.24795096664062
startTok Malta has vibrant light and heavy industry, growing financial services, good agriculture, magnificent tourism and an amazing range of employment opportunities, all of this on an island virtually barren of natural resources. endTok	242.7673498383719
startTok I am certain, therefore, that an island such as Malta, with its population of 340 000 cannot accommodate the rigidities of the economic and legal structures of the mainland which has a population a thousand times greater. endTok	85.10544766806952
startTok Thus, when I look at this proposed instrument I do not see a measure to bring two peoples into the fold of Mother Europe. endTok	87.60323248687416
startTok The situation is more akin to a black hole in space, sucking in masses so powerfully that not even light escapes. endTok	66.42449590684453
startTok We should not be bribing these island peoples to cooperate in their own destruction, giving them money to absorb laws which are as alien to their culture as a black hole is to Mother Earth. endTok	75.91973229221226
startTok The EU should leave Cyprus and Malta alone. endTok	87.43759431800973
startTok It seems to me that the only people in Malta that want this are the political class, and I shall be keeping my fingers crossed that once again the Maltese people are the winners. endTok	65.62937466681345
startTok Mr President, this is one of the few occasions when, from what the speakers have said in this Parliament, from all sides of the House, there is clearly the greatest convergence of views on the Cyprus issue and, of course, on the pre-accession process for Cyprus and Malta. endTok	36.287188965514744
startTok This means that we are all aware of the political dimension of the Cyprus problem. endTok	20.79050323850052
startTok At the same time, however, it means that both the Council and the Commission have a very strong mandate, so that the strength of opinion expressed by all the European parties, and all the peoples, can empower their political ability to address the problem. endTok	41.46568226684703
startTok Helsinki was an historic event, an historic turning-point and an historic new reference point. endTok	298.85480325291144
startTok If, for any reason, the balance achieved there should be considered by some to be a point of departure for new negotiations anywhere else, if some people destabilise this totality of facts and equilibrium by their attitude, they will be making a tragic mistake. endTok	88.49157017587063
startTok Conditions are ripe. endTok	71.54035989686102
startTok What is needed from the European Commission, the Council and everyone else, is a quiet determination, a quiet determination to continue the accession negotiations on both Cyprus and Malta without guile, granted that in the last analysis they are the most mature of all the countries seeking accession, so that this determination can act as a signal to anyone whose view may differ from the view we all agree about. endTok	76.37392820911553
startTok To this end, the Brok report is a good instrument and it is really a bit distressing that, because this is a joint debate, it is politically overshadowed by the political position of the Council and the Commission and we cannot therefore say more about this good report. endTok	36.11912522814527
startTok In any event, the outcome is in your hands. endTok	40.33516476643743
startTok The outcome is in our hands to the extent that we are providing you with decisions, to the extent that we are providing you with options. endTok	48.36221625660341
startTok Now, as regards the Brok report, Cyprus and Malta are the last of the Mediterranean islands, and, unless I am mistaken, the last islands anywhere in Europe which have not acceded to the European Union. endTok	58.052870769156904
startTok This has a certain semiological value because the Mediterranean and its islands - and I too come from an island - are the area which most of those who come from northern Europe for their summer holidays get to see, as well as the people who live there. endTok	84.95044614647848
startTok From that standpoint, Aphrodite' s island, as Cyprus is known, and the pirates' island, as we islanders say of Malta with great affection, are two jewels which should be welcomed into the European Union without delay. endTok	108.05033251211869
startTok They have healthy economies, high-level economic relations, and in the final analysis they constitute a testing ground for the European Union' s political will. endTok	77.99822852898986
startTok In conclusion, since I do not think I need to say much, given the unanimity that exists here, I just want to make one brief remark to the President-in-Office. I think that there are some peculiarities in his position. endTok	37.15562473317542
startTok I hope there has been an interpretation error, and that he will clarify the matter in his follow-up speech. endTok	69.80905845823058
startTok . (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your comments very carefully, and in particular to the rather emotional comments about Cyprus, especially in defence of the present legal situation in Cyprus, which the European Union specifically acknowledges by recognising the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. endTok	46.34473673972162
startTok Mr Wurtz, in no way can it be said that the Council is maintaining an ambiguous silence about this issue: the Council assumes total responsibility for its interpretation of the situation in Cyprus. endTok	62.28187640261628
startTok Moreover, it was this situation and this interpretation which led the Council to take the decision it took in Luxembourg at the end of 1997, when it decided to take the first steps in the accession process for the Republic of Cyprus to join the European Union. endTok	57.7733234860283
startTok I hope that honourable Members will realise that, regardless of the more or less emotional statements made about issues of this kind, the day-to-day reality of international negotiations normally forces governments to adopt a somewhat more flexible stance - and when I say governments I mean all governments. endTok	130.02941034141415
startTok In fact we need more emotional statements to remind us that all these issues have a human side. endTok	67.00241096950663
startTok But we also need to be aware that it is by virtue of rational political stances, and flexibility in negotiations, that we are able to find solutions to the major disputes which have ultimately led to many tragedies in history. endTok	56.884601744635546
startTok Regardless of who is to blame - and we are not here to apportion blame, the relevant United Nations resolutions in this area are clear enough - I believe that we should take advantage of the opportunities that the new situation is opening up, in more of a rational way and less of an emotional one. endTok	65.79892798271675
startTok The European Council in Helsinki had the courage to take certain decisions, and I believe that various aspects of these decisions have already recognised the real value of these opportunities which, as I said at the beginning of my first speech, represent a window of opportunity. endTok	46.925155485200776
startTok We will not achieve concrete results during this stage of negotiations, which is a delicate and sensitive phase, by exploiting tensions. endTok	92.70852485901587
startTok No, we should continue to make progress by working discreetly to support the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations with his remit. endTok	37.95673478624493
startTok The European Union' s position on this is crystal clear, and I do not think it is worthwhile second-guessing particular phrases in the Council' s conclusions or in any other statement. endTok	41.36705648725257
startTok We do not play at political correctness in this House: we are concerned with fairness at international level and with concrete statements on this issue consistently defined by the Council over a period of time, and which the European Commission has also followed carefully, attentively and pragmatically. endTok	47.67857637397375
startTok So when we talk now about the need to involve the Northern Cyprus community in exchanges of information, particularly with a view to the eventual accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, we need to be aware that we are trying to find practical formulas that will enable us to overcome the obstacles standing in the way of a political solution. endTok	39.091348795463965
startTok We are not trying to deceive anyone and we are in no way trying to use practical solutions to create a model implying political recognition. endTok	55.635353599156865
startTok I believe that, over time, the Council of the European Union has clearly demonstrated that this is not how it sees this issue. endTok	33.58415231461965
startTok Decisions have been taken by the Council with a great sense of responsibility. endTok	28.846475791205215
startTok We believe that Helsinki was very clear in this respect. endTok	30.453549185084373
startTok The authorities of the Republic of Cyprus itself have clearly recognised that our relations with them regarding their accession to the European Union have been positive. endTok	73.10197142246099
startTok There is no point in second-guessing or trying to second-guess our intentions. endTok	77.56166249324505
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all very much indeed for this debate, which all in all I have found to be encouraging and supportive, and it has also shown that there is a great deal of support in this House for the policy of the Member States and that of the Commission. endTok	19.03248853607747
startTok However, I would be more than pleased to elucidate a few points as requested. endTok	29.615836653699954
startTok I will turn firstly to matters pertaining to headings 4 and 7. It is quite simple: a special heading, namely, the famous heading 7, was created in Berlin, as part of the large Agenda 2000 package, for the applicant countries of Eastern and Central Europe, which are currently undergoing a process of transformation, and for these countries alone. endTok	72.72058043451352
startTok Malta, Cyprus and Turkey were not provided for at this stage. endTok	118.85780652791227
startTok Mrs Schroedter described this as a lack of coherence. endTok	63.8324957059256
startTok She ought perhaps to take some time to ask the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council, who is not exactly a stranger to you, how this presumed lack of coherence has come about. endTok	60.05879742489658
startTok I have had a little to do with this too. endTok	33.522522342613584
startTok I do not believe this to be the case. The reason for this decision was, rather, that we wanted to have a special instrument for the Eastern and Central European States which, like Malta and Cyprus, are involved in the accession process, but under different conditions. endTok	56.72581882100129
startTok Nevertheless, I have said that I understand the arguments that people have been putting forward here and the Commission will endeavour to take account of these aspirations, but since this is all about Agenda 2000 and the Financial Perspective, we will not be able to do this without amending this Financial Perspective. endTok	43.20496625074163
startTok Hitherto this has been out of the question of course. endTok	47.557779897690416
startTok By way of clarification: if we transfer it across from heading 4 to heading 7 then this will have no effect on the overall balance of the budget. endTok	121.96484799284262
startTok If we do this, then heading 7 would be increased accordingly but heading 4 would be decreased by the same amount. endTok	56.437266400051605
startTok The idea that heading 7 could be added to in this way and heading 4 left alone, is not workable. endTok	69.69168546639665
startTok Parliament is no more able than anyone else to spend money that it has not got, at least not until we have a printing machine installed in the basement that we can use to print euro notes! endTok	71.16334952158415
startTok As for the peace process in Cyprus and how it is linked with the accession negotiations, I would reiterate that there has always been a direct connection between the two. endTok	49.50633113184285
startTok The Commission and the Council have long endeavoured to encourage the two communities in Cyprus to undertake joint projects. endTok	67.7187127608935
startTok So far, as you know, this has proved unsuccessful, and I have been asked if there have been any signs to the contrary. endTok	36.527908394009906
startTok Mrs Rothe, I would put it this way: I am convinced that there has been a distinct improvement in the framework conditions for reaching agreements of this kind. endTok	44.026404765202635
startTok I do not have confirmation of this at present, and nor do I expect it, since we have not yet held direct talks. endTok	94.40450790345102
startTok These will take place at a later date. endTok	18.001567226599423
startTok The framework conditions have changed in that the Helsinki decisions made a whole range of things possible that were not possible hitherto, and, above all, in that the political strategies employed by the parties concerned have changed beyond recognition. endTok	90.5345965050683
startTok I have always believed that the old line - i.e. not to admit Cyprus under any circumstances until the political conflict has been resolved - has a weak point in that it does not provide the Turkish community on Cyprus with a convincing incentive to properly involve themselves, for, with this strategy, the Turkish community would not need to do anything but sit back and wait. endTok	135.04739895141816
startTok There would then be no question of Cyprus acceding to the Union. endTok	58.552589031902954
startTok As matters stand, Turkey has to take seriously the fact that there is a risk of Cyprus being integrated into the European Union, and this would provide opportunities for prosperity and security for the Greek community whilst the Turkish community, whose level of prosperity is already far lower, would fall even further behind. endTok	107.10993978048678
startTok Therefore, it is my firm belief that, since Helsinki, there has been far greater incentive to link the accession process with the resolution of the conflict. endTok	64.43104173283274
startTok Indeed that was the idea behind it. endTok	69.43769517763063
startTok After only a few weeks, Mrs Rothe, it is still too early to deliver a verdict on this, but in any case, I have no grounds for assuming that the new line will fail. endTok	63.492925948966075
startTok As yet, we have no grounds for saying that we will actually succeed, but one thing I can say quite clearly is that the conditions that need to be in place for us to take a step forwards have improved considerably. endTok	52.430045206367794
startTok Finally, of course, the Cyprus question has a role in the discussions with Turkey. endTok	84.62631721917997
startTok I met the Turkish Foreign Minister in Brussels a few weeks ago and naturally I asked if Turkey could take a positive and constructive stance in relation to this issue. endTok	57.77814466897437
startTok I would just make one point: we cannot be 100% sure - I am not at any rate - that one only has to press a button in Ankara to set the wheels in motion in Cyprus. endTok	75.35511020898981
startTok It is very far from being that simple, rather we are going to have to make concentrated efforts, during talks with both communities, to encourage them to reach an understanding. endTok	111.12780791695141
startTok That is what we intend to do: the necessary measures and programmes are in place. endTok	27.43972909034019
startTok I must make it clear to you that we need this financial regulation, the one that has yet to be decided on here, before we can even get started. endTok	57.933077128154665
startTok The financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus. endTok	48.4727926653819
startTok I cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place, because I lack the legal basis for doing so. endTok	68.91533243650426
startTok If the lamented lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point, then I am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that. endTok	39.404052098624675
startTok This legal framework is fleshed out in the priorities set by the accession partnerships that were adopted by the Commission and the Council last year and are now being implemented in the corresponding programmes and project management. endTok	58.40329573629498
startTok On the contrary, I would say that, although many areas of European policy leave something to be desired in terms of coherence, in this instance I would claim, on behalf of the Commission and the Council, that we have developed a very clear, transparent and coherent policy. endTok	34.76868969432478
startTok . (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, now that the Commissioner has explained to us, in an extremely coherent manner, that the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council and his Minister of State for Europe bore responsibility for the lack of coherence, perhaps you could help the Commissioner and ourselves, so as to enable us to take this decision. endTok	37.655912150990936
startTok It would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my questions on the Financial Perspective up until 2004 and on heading B7, or if you could at least confirm that the Portuguese Council Presidency intends to make efforts of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence, which is something the Commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the Commission. endTok	49.35114993355011
startTok . (PT) Mr President, I am sure that the issue raised by my friend Elmar Brok will be considered by the Council. endTok	23.914961806772787
startTok I feel that the criticism made of the previous presidency is not appropriate. endTok	35.7974893097028
startTok I believe that the work done by the previous presidency in defining the financial outlook was excellent, regardless of who was involved in that work. endTok	68.78391375175147
startTok In any case, the question that this raises is an important one and the Council will not fail to support the proposals that the Commission has presented in this respect. endTok	22.584752255471496
startTok Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as I understood it, Mr Brok was actually referring to an earlier presidency still. endTok	59.23589602821582
startTok Mr President, I asked Commissioner Verheugen a specific question about the financing instrument MEDA but he has not provided an answer. endTok	88.04873706770209
startTok I would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us. endTok	32.64588216055728
startTok Forgive me Mr Poos. endTok	67.48114725709854
startTok There was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me. endTok	79.17659492653114
startTok This is how matters stand with regard to MEDA: Malta and Cyprus can take part in the national programmes, but not in the country-specific ones, because the incomes are too high. endTok	86.38727373076216
startTok Thank you very much Commissioner Verheugen. endTok	8.25463806698878
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place on Thursday. endTok	8.454181725060234
startTok Question Time (Council) endTok	638.5749199639876
startTok Question No 1 by (H-0022/00): endTok	8.336761641307945
startTok Subject: Controlling access to Community waters for oil tankers In connection with the accident involving the oil tanker ERIKA off the French coast, which produced a large oil slick, what steps does the Council intend to take to control access to Community waters for tankers flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards? endTok	58.13032060468685
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 January the Council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker Erika. endTok	33.305546785393474
startTok At that time, bearing in mind the strength of public feeling about the disastrous consequences of this accident, the Council made known its concerns about the safety of oil tankers and the environmental protection that should go hand in hand with it. endTok	54.73343604057656
startTok The Council was fully aware of issues of this kind and of the need to take additional measures in this field. endTok	28.701382038575503
startTok It emphasised the importance of the Council taking new measures within a Community framework and in the context of its own work with international organisations. endTok	46.231992956365794
startTok As you know, as currently framed, Community legislation requires port authorities to carry out inspections on board all foreign vessels, including those flying flags of convenience, and to detain them if they do not comply with international standards. endTok	60.13123861521492
startTok There is a directive dating from 1995 on this subject. endTok	39.925940970764735
startTok With regard to the future, the Council noted that work within the Commission should shortly lead to the publication of a communication on the safety of oil tankers and of new proposals to strengthen controls, together with provisions on the qualifications of inspecting agencies. endTok	47.477309564695496
startTok There are also plans for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tankers visiting Community ports. endTok	54.0183913806128
startTok These dossiers will be progressed by the Transport Council and I can therefore assure you, on behalf of the Council, that we will not fail to give the highest priority to the proposals, which there is every indication the Commission is due to present in this area, which we regard as being a vital part of environmental protection. endTok	38.45099212448216
startTok This House will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals, given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure. endTok	46.894611469495075
startTok I am pleased that the Council is considering this question. endTok	15.67798635636726
startTok The President of the Council comes from a country, Portugal, which is directly at risk from just this type of situation. endTok	53.55601681545818
startTok If we stretched our imaginations, we could envisage a situation where, between now and next summer, an oil tanker may run aground under similar circumstances off the Algarve, wreck the Portuguese summer tourist industry, with a bit of luck the sea currents would carry the pollution towards the island of Madeira - because they move in that direction - and furthermore, wreck tourism in the Canary Islands as well. endTok	99.51604711430286
startTok Does the President of the Council not think that we should stop talking and implement tough measures in this area, bearing in mind that we now have the means to control this type of oil tanker on the high seas? endTok	44.4164906373551
startTok Of course, the story of the Erika seems comical. endTok	30.989933146929452
startTok A French-owned ship, under a Maltese flag of convenience, an Indian crew, a sea-worthiness certificate issued by Italy, in Sicily, with the last inspection carried out in Bulgaria, I think. endTok	87.99501278047582
startTok The ship was sinking and the captain realised that it was sinking and that it was not even going to make it to the next port. endTok	47.21429706481106
startTok This kind of situation should not be allowed. endTok	30.04437304123133
startTok The damage to your country, Mr President, and to mine, Spain, could be horrendous. endTok	80.33176662663233
startTok Mr Medina Ortega, I naturally share your concerns and I can assure you that a coastal country like my own, the country currently holding the presidency, is naturally very concerned about this issue, all the more so as it does not have any oil tankers of its own. endTok	61.0743817910339
startTok However, we have to work within the existing legislative framework. endTok	38.84329239648078
startTok That legislative framework is the 1995 directive, which has a set of regulations with a degree of flexibility which should perhaps be implemented more rigorously. endTok	62.64083090971523
startTok In this area we have to work with the world as it is, and that means reacting in accordance with the facts of the situation. endTok	32.711203322571286
startTok In view of the seriousness of such situations, we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the authorities have at least reacted and undertaken to examine the legislative provisions already existing in this field. endTok	56.87681749073559
startTok The Commission' s intentions in this area are positive, as it intends to reinforce the application of the 1995 directive. endTok	29.94345672054953
startTok The Council is minded to give priority to this area, within the Transport Council, and we intend to follow this up as quickly as possible. endTok	33.97748790807843
startTok We also hope that the European Parliament will be able to examine this issue with equal promptness when it comes before this House under the codecision procedure. endTok	25.18425952273676
startTok Mr President, in Kotka, in Finland, there is currently a vessel carrying chemicals, which is sailing under a flag of convenience. endTok	40.84254984221632
startTok The vessel is anchored outside the port, as the condition it is in is a safety hazard for the port and the surrounding areas, and because it cannot be inspected properly, as there is no one who will pay. endTok	78.99580732358625
startTok Would it be possible for the EU to create a standardised inspection system that would also guarantee payment, out of Community funds, for the inspection of ships that fly a flag of convenience and cannot themselves pay the cost? endTok	70.98298529717121
startTok - (PT) Mrs Korhola, as you will understand, I do not at the moment have the information I need to give you a concrete reply. endTok	73.0294336282699
startTok The information that I have is to do with the 1995 directive, which does not include any provisions of that kind. endTok	51.19311493786932
startTok However, the Council will certainly let you have a concrete reply on the options available for acting in the case you have mentioned. endTok	69.96978907874285
startTok Question No 2 by (H-0024/00): endTok	7.320857197652515
startTok Subject: High infant mortality levels in Kosovo According to the most recent UN information forwarded to the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe. About 50% of premature babies do not survive and the war has resulted in a massive increase in the number of miscarriages. endTok	52.57402094250521
startTok Even babies born when due tend to be underdeveloped. endTok	116.73565434472042
startTok In view of the humanitarian aid being given by the European Union and the efforts being made by the head of the interim administration, Mr Bernard Kouchner, what measures will the Council take to defend the rights of the women of Kosovo to motherhood and to protect the health of pregnant women, women in confinement and new-born children? endTok	50.77292079646627
startTok Mr President, Mrs Karamanou' s question is an extremely serious one, and I would not wish to conceal that fact. endTok	22.805060212612798
startTok We are perfectly aware of the difficult and dramatic humanitarian situation in Kosovo and of the problem of displaced people in that region - and I mean people who originate from Kosovo - and of the particular effect of this on child health and on mortality rates. endTok	51.696260910528736
startTok I think it is well known that the European Union has made a clear contribution to the humanitarian aid effort being made by the international community. endTok	16.668789430728538
startTok As you know, the European Community has contributed a total of EUR 378 million for the province of Kosovo alone, and this has to be seen in conjunction with the contributions made by Member States at national level. endTok	24.19808686395402
startTok This contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and health systems and of water purification. endTok	57.66213481031674
startTok Furthermore, as you know, the European Union makes a contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which came to EUR 66.3 million in 1999. endTok	49.76116731956644
startTok I think that Mrs Karamanou is aware that, because of the need for division of labour between the international donors, the task of restoring health care in Kosovo has been entrusted to the World Health Organisation. endTok	41.82421369020428
startTok The reports produced by the WHO indicate that it is fully aware of the alarming infant mortality situation, and it has focused its efforts on improving basic conditions in maternity and general hospitals. endTok	76.82820365737075
startTok Nevertheless, we are aware that this situation is far from a satisfactory solution and that there are widespread repercussions in other areas of health care, apart from child health. endTok	60.142995616108934
startTok This is not just a technical situation, it is a political situation, and it goes hand in hand with the need to solve the political situation, because there are aspects to this, and we may as well be open about this, which are associated with the international community' s inability up to now to make a multi-ethnic society function in Kosovo, with tragic effects on attempts to improve health care in that region. endTok	62.90144507282409
startTok Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for your answer which supplements what Commissioner Patten said yesterday on the subject. endTok	18.41458326669821
startTok Yet, the sum of EUR 378 million you mentioned had been given in 1999, was proved by the facts to be quite insufficient to create even rudimentary civilised conditions in Kosovo, especially where the provision of health services is concerned. endTok	94.47894798610135
startTok Mr President-in-Office, do you not think that the very fact of increased child mortality is an abomination for the continent of Europe, a shameful thing, which should motivate us all, so that the aid we provide becomes more effective and more generous? endTok	68.54297091420875
startTok Of course, the situation was not idyllic, even before the bombardments, anything but, I should say. However, since NATO' s intervention, there has been a very clear deterioration in the natural and human environment. endTok	54.471808176438294
startTok So, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is it not a moral obligation that we should try to create civilised conditions for the long-suffering inhabitants of Kosovo, and above all, keep our promises to them? endTok	37.57526066769679
startTok Mrs Karamanou, I recognise the fact that all the efforts that have been made in Kosovo in this field have not been enough. endTok	25.706133277280333
startTok I do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that. endTok	31.725352575009065
startTok I do not want to link this question with your comments about the period "before" and "after" NATO' s intervention, as we will probably touch on that issue at another point during this Question Time. endTok	81.7998896155829
startTok Nevertheless, I would like to say that the European Union is aware that the resources it has devoted to Kosovo reflect the financial limitations it has to work within. endTok	38.111989486414934
startTok We have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community. endTok	42.64496374029922
startTok The European Union has a certain responsibility in view of that particular role, but we cannot undertake to rapidly rebuild structures that were, as you have said yourself, Mrs Karamanou, not the best before the military action in Kosovo. endTok	56.73985897795632
startTok What is more, I do not believe, Mrs Karamanou, that the military action in Kosovo resulted in such a significant destruction of public health facilities as to have had a direct impact on the current situation. endTok	38.11573335211759
startTok The present position is more dramatic in terms of displaced populations, and in terms of a whole raft of economic factors and of the level of satisfaction with basic health facilities resulting from the overall breakdown in organisational structures in Kosovo' s administration. endTok	71.07632984639542
startTok This is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole. endTok	27.509924308130135
startTok And if we cannot solve the political problem, which must be done in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolution, then we will not solve the problem of child health, nor the various other problems faced by this region. endTok	59.97274386682679
startTok I would like to widen the debate and include the situation in Mitrovica. endTok	21.305544668468578
startTok In cooperation with Europe, the international community rebuilt the hospital there too, but it is located in the northern part of the city, thus prohibiting access to Albanian Kosovars. endTok	73.25596057431379
startTok This means that medical aid is still denied to the Albanian Kosovars. endTok	37.41994409674534
startTok This is also happening elsewhere in the country, causing tension between the Albanian Kosovars and Serbs, making for a situation where nobody trusts anybody anymore and where Albanians do not want to be looked after by Serbs and vice versa. endTok	70.73862302498594
startTok I understand very well what you are saying and you are right: the European Union should work in a wider context of international cooperation. endTok	34.7212646713677
startTok But where will you place the emphasis? endTok	227.46995542148207
startTok What will you do to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital, including that in Mitrovica? endTok	77.53899444104289
startTok Mr Staes, the situation in Mitrovica is well known. endTok	20.234215374344167
startTok This is a very special situation with a degree of inter-ethnic tension which fortunately is not matched with such severity in others parts of Kosovo. endTok	69.67985602612427
startTok I perfectly understand Mr Staes' s concerns. endTok	60.821250536977345
startTok Nevertheless, I would like to say that Bernard Kouchner' s work in this area has aimed to comply with the objectives of the relevant United Nations resolution, in an attempt to create multi-ethnic facilities which can serve the various communities, including the various aspects of the administration. endTok	41.90284432464631
startTok I believe that we should not jump to conclusions here about who is responsible, because there are various protagonists involved. endTok	49.949126634235
startTok The situation in Mitrovica is appalling, and involves very special tensions, and I believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed. endTok	35.08203548508558
startTok Nevertheless, I have to say that, regrettably, we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the Member States' contributions - to guarantee the follow-up action we proposed to the military action, that is to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities, and, in particular, access to hospitals. endTok	45.365065512317834
startTok Question No 3 by (H-0027/00): endTok	7.016129199791178
startTok Subject: Indictment of NATO before War Crimes Tribunal Human rights organisations, such as the US Human Rights Watch, have already collected significant evidence of NATO crimes in connection with the bombing of Kosovo and Serbia with a view to bringing a case before the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. endTok	88.6337584515375
startTok On the basis of this evidence, some of which has already been lodged with the Tribunal, NATO is accused of 'serious violations of international humanitarian law' and 'wilful murder'. endTok	50.22913418309916
startTok Does the Council consider that such accusations should be put before the War Crimes Tribunal for a thorough judicial investigation? endTok	71.94186787330932
startTok In the event of a judicial inquiry into the accusations against NATO, what will be done in respect of the High Representative for the CFSP, who was NATO Secretary-General during the crisis? endTok	65.27756909485925
startTok Is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed? endTok	158.87801270170962
startTok Mr President, Mr Alavanos' question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues. endTok	83.88359030027868
startTok The Council has already, on various occasions, stated its conviction that the severe measures taken by NATO were both necessary and justified to deal with extremist and irresponsible actions involving clear violations of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. endTok	139.374066664959
startTok I am aware that there may be different views about NATO' s action and the legitimacy of that action. endTok	45.1609869241288
startTok Everyone is free to hold such views. endTok	190.77811107015805
startTok In my own country, the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter. endTok	31.04399813086256
startTok That was how it was. endTok	131.74333004594806
startTok In any case, the Council' s position is clear in that it considers that the objective of the air campaign carried out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was to put an end to the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo caused by the Belgrade regime. endTok	30.65745556324366
startTok This objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 April. endTok	54.03295948024067
startTok I must say that these NATO measures were not taken lightly and were only carried out as a last resort when it became evident that all avenues for reaching a negotiated solution had been exhausted and that the Belgrade authorities were concentrating their forces in order to expel the Kosovo Albanians from their land. endTok	79.82772630740163
startTok I am sure you are aware, Mr Alavanos, that, during her recent visit to NATO headquarters, Prosecutor Del Ponte stressed that the International Tribunal was obliged to examine all accusations presented to it, including those made against NATO, in particular by pacifist groups from Canada. endTok	101.37368236407933
startTok This compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted. endTok	56.312884682029214
startTok In any case, I have with me a statement made by Prosecutor Del Ponte according to which NATO is not at present under any investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and there is no formal inquiry process concerning NATO' s actions in the Kosovo conflict. endTok	73.97192764861286
startTok All information received during the past six months, either from individuals or from groups requesting an investigation of NATO' s actions during the Kosovo conflict, have been recorded by the Prosecutor. endTok	227.31056608317004
startTok Any other information will of course be analysed by the Prosecutor, who will in due course decide whether or not there is cause for action. endTok	70.45477589900875
startTok Until that time Prosecutor Del Ponte has decided not to examine any of the accusations of criminality made against NATO. endTok	123.48823605450393
startTok I thank the President-in-Office but I do not agree with him that the purpose of NATO' s intervention was to stop a humanitarian disaster, because we have a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo today, we have the hell of Milosevic, followed by the hell of the KLA and the NATO forces. endTok	31.099899864235187
startTok If the President-in-Office has noticed, almost half the questions he has had to answer today relate to Kosovo. endTok	80.64975267455841
startTok Despite this, he too accepted that the inquisition procedure of the War Crimes Tribunal against NATO after applications by Canadian and other pacifist organisations is an open question. endTok	120.66019471288507
startTok My question, which the President-in-Office did not answer, is this: if this inquisition procedure begins, in which the main or, if you will, one of the main people interrogated and probably found guilty will be Mr Solana, who is today the High Representative of the European Union' s Common Foreign and Security Policy, should it not be, if that happens, if the General Prosecutor of the Tribunal is determined to begin the process, that Mr Solana' s status is suspended at least until it is shown that his hands are clean? endTok	81.07891466244168
startTok Mr Alavanos, if an action of this kind should be brought against NATO and if this action were to be brought against Mr Javier Solana personally, we would have to bear in mind that Mr Javier Solana held one post at that time and is holding a different one today. endTok	86.72075244887094
startTok The duties that he exercises today have nothing whatsoever to do with the duties that he exercised during his time as Secretary-General of NATO. endTok	93.63505841581582
startTok In the absence of any corresponding indication from any international judicial body which could justify any personal accusation against Mr Javier Solana - and there is no sign of this whatsoever - the European Union will not of course make any statement at all on this matter. endTok	85.56497000344635
startTok Mr President, I believe Mr Alavanos is getting NATO and Mr Milosevic mixed up. endTok	61.29202276684807
startTok Mr Milosevic should be appearing before the war crimes tribunal and we should be awarding NATO the Sakharov prize. endTok	63.37314695835475
startTok But I have a quite different question for the Council. endTok	45.439008947930965
startTok How do matters stand in Kosovo with regard to the rebuilding of the administration, the judiciary and, most importantly of all, the police force? endTok	53.859531291370814
startTok You mentioned before that we are on the brink of catastrophe there and nothing is being done. endTok	62.72556813600342
startTok Rapid action is called for! endTok	243.21749617655263
startTok First of all, I would like to say that I agree with the priorities you have identified concerning personal responsibility, Mr Posselt. endTok	32.16232162086382
startTok With regard to the judicial structure in Kosovo, we have already heard Mr Kouchner, on various occasions, describe the enormous difficulties he is experiencing in setting up administrative machinery and a judicial structure. endTok	74.2761778652422
startTok As you know, the first steps were taken some months ago. endTok	34.46763281062548
startTok We are all aware of the difficulties, and particularly the financial difficulties, that Mr Kouchner is facing in setting up this administrative machinery, and, in particular, we are aware of the special difficulty involved in recruiting police so as to ensure day-to-day public safety. endTok	65.04980813557675
startTok This is a responsibility that the European Union takes very seriously, Mr Posselt, and I would like to mention that, at the General Affairs Council held on Monday, this issue was repeatedly stressed when we were discussing Kosovo. endTok	40.52868181015236
startTok Statements were made and pressure was brought to bear on the various Member States who have undertaken to make police resources available to honour their commitments. endTok	107.57238881583231
startTok Some Member States are taking refuge in the fact that they have provided military forces and that they cannot send the police forces, to which they committed themselves, as quickly as they would like. endTok	44.93345849884378
startTok We are certainly very much aware that this factor is seriously compromising Mr Kouchner' s work and the normalisation of administrative structures in Kosovo, especially as regards judicial structures and police cover. endTok	77.49327174004033
startTok This is having unfortunate and obvious effects on the scope for controlling inter-ethnic coordination, and we are all conscious that, if measures are not taken in the short term, we may end up with situations involving the kind of tensions that we witnessed just a few hours ago, and that these tensions may be mirrored in other areas of Kosovo. endTok	57.98578128306521
startTok This is obviously a question which really has to be seen in a NATO context, but, as the European Union shares NATO' s view of these issues, it is not difficult for us to associate ourselves with this. I would like to make this clear on behalf of the Council, so that there can be no doubt. endTok	29.33759419641697
startTok Mr Marset Campos, you will be aware, first of all, of how difficult it is to select targets during a military operation, particularly an air-based one, and you will also be aware that there is a category of targets that, whilst they are not military targets as such, are infrastructure targets selected with a view to hindering the smooth running of the military machine. endTok	91.74595680346525
startTok We are of course entering a grey area here, and you may say, Mr Marset Campos, that these are civilian targets, such as bridges and road and rail infrastructure, whilst others will tell me that they are military targets, because they are targets which support military structures in aggressive campaigns such as those carried out by Mr Milosevic' s forces in Kosovo. endTok	91.3456645279072
startTok So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets. endTok	88.86854883069408
startTok Unfortunately, and as everyone recognised during the military action in Kosovo, there were civilian sectors, and in particular infrastructural sectors directly affecting the general public, and even inhabited areas, which were directly affected by NATO air attacks. endTok	121.78469332582335
startTok This is generally recognised and this happens in all wars, and the Kosovo war was not a clean war, nor a model war, but a war based on the art of the possible. endTok	133.66786258686318
startTok And, above all, it was a necessary war, and it was not only about what was possible, it was necessary to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable form of aggression which was utterly rejected by the entire international community. endTok	43.572198927920816
startTok Mr Marset Campos, regardless of how we may see things with hindsight - and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight, if you take no action yourself - I believe that, if we look at what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the impunity that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to, and the continuation of that impunity, then we might perhaps see the NATO military action in Kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light. endTok	59.76360604386403
startTok Question No 4 by (H-0028/00): endTok	5.832778875927475
startTok Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Council taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia? endTok	63.35408184510314
startTok Has the time come for the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia? endTok	68.19297389505155
startTok Mr President, I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer. endTok	10.26380402039368
startTok Nevertheless, I am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when, ultimately, there is in fact a major tripartite relationship. endTok	56.34261777679922
startTok We provide partnership funding and there are cooperation agreements in place, in order to help Armenia, and still the aid cannot come into play because Turkey has imposed an economic blockade, and so many things cannot get through to the Armenians at all. endTok	114.26056768052553
startTok We are negotiating with Turkey as to the possibility of its acceding to the Union and so it is in the interests of all of us that every state that wishes to become a Member should cultivate friendly relations with its neighbours. endTok	59.368885447559805
startTok Can you not exert greater influence over Turkey, so as to enable there to be peaceful developments in this region, and so as to enable Armenians themselves to develop in the way they need to for there to be progress on the cooperation front? endTok	78.52590675360487
startTok - (PT) Mrs Schleicher, you are quite right to say that we should use our relationship with Turkey to ensure that that country can play a constructive role in this situation and, particularly, that it becomes part of the solution rather than part of the problem. endTok	40.59137412071183
startTok We feel that precisely because Turkey has embarked on a new type of relationship with the European Union, and also because Turkey now has to respond to the European Union' s positions on common foreign and security policy issues, we will, to be frank, be testing Turkey' s will as regards the European Union' s priorities in its foreign relations. endTok	47.65624454970819
startTok Our relationship with Armenia, as evinced by the agreement we signed with that country last year, is of course one element in these foreign relations. endTok	75.07647003166444
startTok We also feel that, if Turkey wishes to move towards sharing the fundamental values of the European Union and the general framework of the European Union' s relations, regardless of whatever special bilateral conditions may apply to its own relations with any other country, it must in general act in accordance with the basic standards demonstrated by the European Union in its foreign relations. endTok	52.32250309341902
startTok We are, moreover, convinced that this issue will be one of the priorities of the bilateral relations between the European Union and Turkey in the near future. endTok	18.725385978819652
startTok Question No 6 by (H-0122/00): endTok	6.412036624760643
startTok Subject: Ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo Since the end of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and the EU aimed at preventing the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians by Serbia, and since the arrival of KFOR on 12 June 1999, 200 000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been expelled and 768 murdered, constituting ethnic cleansing on a larger scale than that carried out by the Serbs themselves. endTok	65.52955852713207
startTok During the last few days we have seen Serbs murdered by Kosovar Albanian Mafia-type groups, also with impunity. endTok	66.6320603421694
startTok What decision will the Council adopt to put an end, once and for all, to this ethnic cleansing and to guarantee respect for the human rights of the whole population of Kosovo, irrespective of race or creed? endTok	61.18007144466836
startTok I thank the Minister for his response, but I would also like to point out that, statistically, there is now more violence in Kosovo than there was before the NATO bombing. endTok	29.450550499793152
startTok It is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation, and we should recognise that it was a mistake on the part of NATO and the European Union to take such action. endTok	26.667868799542244
startTok I agree with what the Minister very rightly said about the culpability of Belgrade, but we should also remember that the secret services of the USA, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom have been supplying arms and money to the KLA, a mafia, which has contributed to the problems in the area. endTok	40.74886467308754
startTok We are therefore all to blame. endTok	27.088601626048032
startTok I would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context. endTok	14.459272953023522
startTok Do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on Serbia in order to normalise the area economically and also to benefit Kosovo as a province of Serbia? endTok	47.80244906141159
startTok Mr President, I am no friend of Milosevic or his government. endTok	44.72670392077614
startTok Nevertheless I have the gravest doubts about the legitimacy of Nato's action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, both in terms of the lack of authority from the UN Security Council and because it could have been avoided by not imposing unacceptable terms on Serbia's sovereignty at Rambouillet. endTok	86.31772733378405
startTok The current situation in Kosovo, which is now ethnically cleansed of Serbs and Roma, speaks for itself. endTok	41.717036142101875
startTok Should Nato not at the very least acknowledge fault for its deliberate targeting of the Belgrade TV tower and killing over 20 civilian journalists, which remains a severe moral blemish on the conduct of the war and now opens the embarrassment of a possible indictment for war crimes against our Western leaders? endTok	123.74234511768081
startTok Mr Tannock, with regard to the position adopted by the European Union, we do not have selective interpretations and analyses of what were military objectives, and in particular of the initiatives taken against certain types of infrastructure that were propping up Mr Milosevic' s political system and acting as propaganda for him. endTok	58.10571161233281
startTok I cannot therefore tell you whether we agreed or not on a specific action carried out by NATO, but it was part of an overall plan with which we do agree. endTok	50.27541707700397
startTok Some of these actions might have been questionable, and some were regarded as unfortunate by NATO itself, but others were justified for tactical reasons, with the aim of preventing Mr Milosevic from continuing his propaganda campaign within the former Yugoslavia. endTok	118.53462776871122
startTok In any event, I, on behalf of the Council, do not wish to make a value judgement about any specific military action carried out by NATO. endTok	47.32002624556328
startTok Mr President-in-Office of the Council, since I know the history of the Balkans, I should like to remind you that, for many decades, the peoples of Yugoslavia lived in peace. endTok	30.35023094113038
startTok Destabilisation began around ten years ago with the break-up of Yugoslavia, in which the European Union played a decisive part. endTok	50.78842993567943
startTok Yugoslavia' s crime was that it was the only Balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of NATO or of the European Union. endTok	79.28525090310819
startTok So whatever remained standing after the air attacks is now being destroyed by the supposedly disarmed KLA, under the very nose of KFOR, whose role as an occupying force is becoming increasingly apparent. endTok	94.64971053340045
startTok Every day, new crimes come to light against non-Albanian speakers and against the cultural heritage of Kosovo, and there are hundreds of violations of the UN' s Resolution 1244. endTok	126.00797464351722
startTok In my opinion, the best thing the Council could do would be to cease occupying that part of Yugoslavia and search for a solution acceptable to all sides, with respect for the various national characteristics in the area and especially respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another, independent country. endTok	71.87068685275595
startTok I respect your understanding and knowledge of the Balkan region, Mr Alyssandrakis, but I find it difficult, quite frankly, to understand how respecting the characteristics of the region can, in terms of political stability, be a solution to the problem. endTok	68.50389219129507
startTok If we look at the democratic stability of the region, it could perhaps be said that it was the break-up of Yugoslavia that caused the current situation, but let us not get involved in interpreting an international development. endTok	55.40484440973009
startTok Nevertheless, I would like to say that Yugoslavia was what it was, in the sense that the state managed to harmonise some of its people' s ethnic differences to a degree. It must be pointed out that it did this at a time when its political framework was far from ideal in terms of being democratically representative. endTok	75.44625319950572
startTok The division of Yugoslavia is probably a historical fact that we shall have to accept, regardless of the mistakes that may have been made along the way. endTok	48.5066543965417
startTok We do not feel that withdrawing international forces now would be any kind of solution. Quite the contrary, it would be a solution leading to calamity. endTok	70.04513260361256
startTok Mr President, I was a little disappointed with the answer given by the President-in-Office to my colleague. endTok	21.132613055015952
startTok It is very important, if we stress that Europe is to be a Europe of values, that we do not go down the road of saying that means justify ends. endTok	43.96875261174106
startTok If civilian targets were targeted and destroyed, killing civilians is illegal by anyone's standards. endTok	277.2951584415668
startTok It should not be defended even by those of us who deeply deplore the Milosevic regime. endTok	57.74388167884233
startTok That, however, is not my question. endTok	53.64447507175345
startTok My question is about political prisoners held in Serbia now. endTok	69.99908897525401
startTok There are, I believe, around 5 000 Kosovar political prisoners held in Serbia at the moment. endTok	81.71525308396812
startTok My question to the President-in-Office is twofold. endTok	27.077411485873697
startTok Firstly, is the Council fully aware of and concerned about the fate of these prisoners? endTok	76.28864865370325
startTok Secondly, what does it propose to do about them? endTok	59.99064840665166
startTok Mr MacCormick, first of all, I would like to answer your comments. endTok	19.55117865670072
startTok I did not defend attacks on civilians. endTok	82.67367701988913
startTok What I said and what I explained in a previous answer is that there are civilian targets linked with structures which are objects for military action, and you know as well as I do that some military actions not only go for military targets, but also for civilian targets and structures which are connected with military action. endTok	78.1687561076673
startTok What is a legitimate target is obviously a grey area. endTok	83.45553892357121
startTok As I said, we are not making value judgements about specific actions. endTok	71.53701689098384
startTok We are making an overall value judgement about NATO' s action, and this overall value judgement is positive. We agree with the general view of NATO' s action. endTok	103.12550593104977
startTok With regard to political prisoners in Serbia, Mr MacCormick, it is obvious that, when I say that in Serbia today Mr Milosevic is not acting in accordance with the rules of a decent society at international level, I am referring specifically, not just to the way he acts towards his fellow citizens. I am also referring to the way Mr Milosevic treats political prisoners, and the way he attacks democratic rights and the opposition' s rights of access to the media, and to his attacks on the facilities that should be granted to non-governmental organisations, particularly those protecting human rights. endTok	78.27841783367893
startTok In spite of everything, all this represents only one of many kinds of highly pernicious action perpetrated by Mr Milosevic on Yugoslavian society, and the European Union is of course inevitably concerned about this situation. endTok	59.929006057348246
startTok This is precisely why the European Union is maintaining all its sanctions until Yugoslavia' s behaviour on the international stage reflects the values that we have to defend. endTok	70.38147517775926
startTok Question No 7 by (H-0035/00): endTok	7.7479358207050755
startTok Subject: Drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century. endTok	25.23010272452031
startTok What are the Council's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)? endTok	70.3553028531975
startTok Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)? endTok	60.3954639203939
startTok Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda? endTok	68.6320595282886
startTok What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes? endTok	79.59989148891123
startTok What are the Council's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union? endTok	34.30310523838275
startTok I thank the President-in-Office for the concerns and certainties he has expressed about the progress of the work. endTok	25.846602107933606
startTok You will understand, Mr President-in-Office, that there was a point to my question, because the Council is a political body of the European Union and the citizens of Europe, men and women, want to know how it views the democratic and social model of Europe in the twenty-first century. endTok	39.290830943445364
startTok As a supplementary question, I should like to ask you whether, as the Portuguese Presidency, you have made provision for the rights of children, as such, to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the Charter. endTok	38.1515640163727
startTok As I said, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights. endTok	27.49034647094786
startTok This procedure falls within the competence of the members of the group, and the matter will only be submitted to the Council if and when consensus is reached on the terms of this charter. endTok	54.25892526616168
startTok I would nevertheless like to say, with regard to the rights of the child, that we consider this to be an extremely topical issue, particularly for the Council of Europe and in view of the existence of a set of relevant international texts to which we have signed up. endTok	37.579480424182854
startTok This matter should form part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. endTok	21.25847801408702
startTok This will certainly be the guideline that my government for one will advocate for the Charter of Fundamental Rights. endTok	56.62787797194691
startTok Furthermore, we will see if we can do this for a range of other proposals that we have on this issue. endTok	32.622065911165215
startTok I do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not. endTok	26.90550040915955
startTok I presume, however, that this is not a particularly controversial matter and we think that it would simply involve bringing together the currently agreed corpus of rights, which even the most elementary justice would suggest should be included in the charter and be shared by the Union as a whole. endTok	68.88931112846214
startTok I would remind Members that, according to the guidelines for these sittings, questions must be concise and be worded in a way which will allow a brief answer. endTok	50.52218940305434
startTok You know that there is a Parliamentary delegation chaired by Mr Méndez de Vigo and a Committee on Constitutional Affairs where these issues can be debated at great length. endTok	37.20368707349107
startTok I therefore ask that both questions and answers be very brief. endTok	76.97260602080067
startTok Otherwise, we would be in a way undermining the whole process of drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights. endTok	30.11431640177075
startTok I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is prepared to answer everything, but I must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers. endTok	26.224630791746463
startTok Mr Rübig has the floor. endTok	39.495163324715065
startTok Mr President, fourteen Member States have imposed bilateral sanctions on another Member State, because a democratically elected government was formed there. endTok	50.02825176162056
startTok Both parties were once part of the government. endTok	134.72214262505076
startTok So far there have been no infringements of the law. endTok	23.725974655773587
startTok Are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the Charter of Human Rights? endTok	62.97809576566041
startTok Would a right of veto on the part of the President-in-Office of the Council, in respect of the formation of national governments, be reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights? endTok	27.87117743917865
startTok Is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights? endTok	43.06971170549602
startTok Mr Rübig, as President-in-Office, I cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the Portuguese Prime Minister on behalf of the fourteen Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the European Union was adopted bilaterally and not by him in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union. endTok	25.47875439723621
startTok Nevertheless, I would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these Member States was actually a set of actions of what I would call preventive political action at diplomatic level. We feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which, although it has become part of a European Union government, does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the Union' s aims. endTok	54.13371686030449
startTok I do not wish to dwell on this subject on behalf of the Council presidency, because my government intervened at the request of, and in conjunction with, fourteen Member States and not in its presidency capacity. endTok	40.30636356263803
startTok Mr President, I have the honour of being a member of the Convention drafting the Charter so I am not going to ask the presidency to speculate on the contents or whether it thinks the Convention should be declaratory or whether it should have judicial force. endTok	52.97994695762099
startTok What I would like to know is what will happen to the draft Charter that the Convention draws up? endTok	44.629046098405
startTok Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands, or will the Council feel free to amend that document? endTok	92.21661846458333
startTok Will the Council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft Charter? endTok	167.87969529441898
startTok - (PT) The answer is neither yes nor no. endTok	344.1444878822729
startTok I do not know, Mr Martin. It will depend on the decision taken by the Council. endTok	20.673086268263937
startTok Question No 8 by (H-0042/00): endTok	8.470459510765247
startTok Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey The G8 meeting in Cologne called on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits. endTok	72.32948641013078
startTok These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects. endTok	105.33502416825795
startTok Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process? endTok	70.559705373559
startTok The need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the British Government that it is 'minded to grant' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey. endTok	67.39435599613257
startTok The World Bank has decided not to fund the project, which will displace 20 000 Kurds, potentially limit the fresh water supply to Syria and Iraq and cause ecological damage. endTok	96.62725678288199
startTok What is the Council's view of the involvement of European governments and companies in this project? endTok	30.064931110804746
startTok The process of agreeing these common standards may have started as long ago as 1978 but clearly the fact that the British Government appears to be going ahead with a massively environmentally damaging project suggests that it has not been very successful so far. endTok	58.19724431436112
startTok I wonder if you would answer a question concerning investment by EU companies in the EU applicant countries. endTok	87.14813793391036
startTok I ask this because of the issue of coherence, the subject of this morning' s discussion. endTok	50.42086862811949
startTok On the one hand we ask applicant countries to take on board the environmental acquis and yet, at the very same time, the EU Member States are supporting and encouraging investment in those countries which is itself hugely environmentally damaging. endTok	49.5611402357737
startTok Can you say whether or not the specific issue of investment in applicant countries has featured in any of the discussions to date to which you have been referring? endTok	70.13075600667402
startTok - (PT) Mrs Lucas, I was not present at the debate you are referring to. endTok	81.24707275566342
startTok I would like to say that the Council will only be able to respond to that part of your question in writing, at a later date. endTok	17.665692286295485
startTok Question No 9 by (H-0044/00): endTok	8.067225046045948
startTok Subject: Environmental problems caused by the Drogheda Port Company development project, and the role of the Court of Auditors A major conflict between environmental conservation and structural development interests has arisen in the area of the Boyne Estuary, Ireland, following a development project of the Drogheda Port Company. endTok	79.22508634546494
startTok The affected area is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. Many local and European associations have strongly criticised the project. endTok	99.68626389136082
startTok Similar cases occur in other regions of the Union, where EU development funding conflicts with environmental unsustainability of the beneficiary measures. endTok	153.3686566065119
startTok Is not the Council of the opinion that the Court of Auditors should be given more resources in order to investigate or review similar development measures where environmental conflicts arise? endTok	68.33769758175491
startTok What kind of measures does the Council plan to take in order to strengthen the review and evaluation powers of the European institutions in similar cases? endTok	74.65063304018122
startTok . (PT) In response to your question, Mrs McKenna, I would first of all like to highlight the fact that the role of the Court of Auditors was laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community. endTok	25.07812792787185
startTok In accordance with Article 246 of the Treaty, the auditing of accounts is carried out by the Court of Auditors which, to this end, studies the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of the Community as well as the regularity and the legality of the underlying transactions. The Court also guarantees proper financial management. endTok	52.8795593700258
startTok This is indeed also stipulated in Article 248. endTok	54.0262610155388
startTok The Court of Auditors, therefore, already has all the instruments necessary to carry out its role. endTok	56.3286490567319
startTok With regard to your suggestion for increasing the Court' s resources, the Council considers that all of the Union' s institutions have, under the Community budget, the necessary financial means for them to be able to properly carry out their respective remits. endTok	42.717284362757226
startTok In some cases, it would probably be desirable for their financial resources to be increased, but there are budgetary restraints of which I am sure you are aware. endTok	44.947816173804505
startTok I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the Budget of the European Union is approved by common agreement between the Council and this Parliament. endTok	17.214864402657533
startTok The Council therefore, has no means of changing the role conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty. endTok	42.94434012216333
startTok If extra resources were given to the Court of Auditors it would be money well spent, because it would ensure that EU funding was not going to something that conflicted with environmental concerns. endTok	91.0180947845118
startTok For years the Council has been blocking the strategic development impact assessment of plans and programmes. endTok	76.80816717590223
startTok I would ask you, now that you are President of the Council, will you push forward with this extremely important proposal. endTok	39.39559781340254
startTok Secondly, as there is no mention of Structural Funds in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in? endTok	59.588631511034066
startTok I would like to know what you could do about this as President-in-Office of the Council at the moment because it is the Council that has been blocking this for a long time. endTok	20.984406443513816
startTok It is extremely important. endTok	13.198719908372537
startTok If the Court of Auditors were able to assess regularly the potential conflicts between environmental concerns and structural development, it would be very important because the Court of Auditors could do an extremely good job. endTok	65.1724453476605
startTok Their reports are extremely detailed and very important. endTok	94.2149128692915
startTok This is the way to ensure that such conflicts are avoided in the future. endTok	20.019169175184693
startTok - (PT) Mrs McKenna, a large part of the problem you have raised relates to issues which are the responsibility of the Commission. endTok	48.44029424570819
startTok It is therefore the Commission that must ensure that certain development projects comply with relevant environmental provisions. endTok	57.679597063691894
startTok The Commission will have to provide specific answers to these questions. endTok	22.12283444017637
startTok I do not think that I can give a more complete answer on the specific case that you quoted. endTok	44.12986627990996
startTok Question No 10 by (H-0053/00): endTok	7.9471018259899155
startTok Subject: Statute for Members of the European Parliament The Council and Parliament are going to try to reach agreement on a Statute for the Members of the European Parliament. endTok	22.407596569842795
startTok One of the matters to be settled is whether Members are to receive equal pay, and where they are to pay tax. endTok	90.28541594724871
startTok According to media reports the Portuguese Presidency considers that all Members should pay the same tax, to the EU. This is in conflict with the view taken by some Member States who wish to have the right to tax their Members in their home countries. endTok	59.92817734814675
startTok Will the Portuguese Presidency clarify its position on this matter? endTok	35.457855827727755
startTok . (PT) The Portuguese Presidency is particularly interested in this issue, as I suppose that this is the first time a presidency has made resolving the problem of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament a priority in its programme. endTok	31.822553749525877
startTok The Portuguese Presidency made reaching an agreement on this statute one of its priorities, as furthermore, did the President of the European Parliament, when she stated this at the Helsinki European Council. endTok	49.11216996730035
startTok We are therefore in perfect and total agreement in our concern to achieve a positive outcome on this matter. endTok	63.3308247380901
startTok We are therefore taking advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outlines of a compromise, and we have already begun work on this matter. endTok	44.91422212113631
startTok It is worth pointing out once more that this compromise will require the unanimous support of the Council, in accordance with Article 190, and the assent of this Parliament, to which it falls to approve this statute. endTok	60.68894328507756
startTok The Presidency has engaged in intensive discussions with a range of Members of this Parliament and with the group to which Parliament entrusted the task of negotiating with the Council. endTok	44.53781297791761
startTok I myself had an opportunity to meet this group, for the first time, in parallel with the January part-session, and I am trying to arrange to do so again soon in order to continue these discussions. endTok	47.13635208873295
startTok These discussions have also recommenced more intensively in the relevant bodies of the Council, and I think that I can say, in a spirit of openness and greater flexibility, and because we all recognise the importance that this has, particularly for the general public, that drawing up this statute is a vital factor in ensuring both the dignity of the functions of Members of the European Parliament and the necessary transparency and good management of public funds. endTok	43.222738900182854
startTok With regard more specifically to your question, I would like to highlight the fact that it only makes sense to have a new statute if it represents progress in comparison with the current situation and if it ensures that holders of identical posts are as far as possible treated in the same way. endTok	40.24070538246638
startTok This has, from the outset, been the position of the Portuguese Presidency. endTok	46.76200795225077
startTok Nevertheless, our role as mediator means that we must take account of all current attitudes in the Council and I am sure you are aware, Mr Sjöstedt, that the tax issue poses problems for certain delegations. endTok	62.28793515313539
startTok As this is the case, whatever solution is found, I think that it will have to respect both democratic law and be acceptable to all Member States, regardless of their national positions on the matter. endTok	58.24485607331702
startTok What I can promise with regard to this issue is that the presidency has the utmost commitment to working, for as long as it is involved with this matter, in an atmosphere of total transparency and openness towards Members of the European Parliament. We will also make the utmost effort with members of the Council, particularly with those who had most difficulty in accepting the proposal suggested last year, so as to reach a reasonable compromise solution, and one which would at the same time guarantee the dignity appropriate for a statute for the members of this House. endTok	60.45476094388374
startTok Mr President, I would thank the Council of Ministers for its answer. I want to ask two follow-up questions connected with the taxation of ourselves as parliamentarians. endTok	49.43371196356746
startTok My basic view is that one ought to pay tax in the country in which one lives, in which one' s family lives and in which one benefits from public services. endTok	107.04070582288118
startTok I intended to ask the presidency if there really is an argument for saying that we should not pay tax in our own countries just as other people do. endTok	54.75337926022985
startTok Is there any argument for our being given a special privilege just because we are parliamentarians? endTok	58.82636896384667
startTok That is my first question. endTok	20.79972500965419
startTok My second question is about whether the Portuguese Presidency can accept a solution which involves the tax issue' s being solved in different ways for Members of different nationalities, or whether you want a solution which is identical for members of all nationalities. endTok	59.279636786269315
startTok - (PT) Without wishing to show any lack of respect towards this House and particularly because of the respect that your questions deserve, I would rather not answer the questions you have raised immediately. endTok	109.57314651376133
startTok We are in the midst of rather sensitive negotiations. endTok	49.79892097615507
startTok This sensitivity is reflected in the way in which the Presidency of the Council of the European Union expresses itself in a specific context in relation to particular situations. endTok	29.802230069257725
startTok This has an impact of course, because it is read by other members of the Council. endTok	29.866389789642884
startTok At this stage in the discussion, please forgive me if I cannot give a direct answer to the specific questions that have been put to me. I would ask that we be judged on our results, when we endeavour to reach a more concrete solution in the near future. endTok	36.58032147841258
startTok I will be happy to come back to Parliament to respond to and clarify the problems which may conceivably occur if a result is not reached, or to congratulate all of you if this result is achieved. endTok	49.68033252098547
startTok I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, after his few hours working in this Chamber with these Members of the European Parliament, whether he has come to any assessment of what they are worth in terms of pay? endTok	27.539376302736258
startTok Mr Purvis, as this discussion of salaries in the European Parliament does not relate exclusively to your country and even affects my country, I have a precise idea of what the salaries of the Members of the European Parliament are worth. endTok	48.34337916933846
startTok I am therefore perfectly aware of this problem. endTok	21.2413840544114
startTok Mr President, I want to thank you for your answer. I want to ask a follow-up question which bears some resemblance to the one Mr Sjöstedt asked. endTok	33.13758208975811
startTok We both come from Sweden. In our country, we pay our tax in the form of local taxes because the services concerned are local. endTok	120.57622246031406
startTok We have extensive services, too. We have problems stemming from the lack of confidence in politicians and, not least, in European politicians here in Parliament. endTok	72.51707559893092
startTok How do you think that public confidence in ourselves as politicians would be affected if a situation were to arise in which we obtained the right to use services where we live - education, health care etc - but, at the same time, did not pay any tax and did not contribute? endTok	91.99223735655299
startTok How do you think a system like that would affect people' s confidence in ourselves as politicians? endTok	88.97510311093971
startTok Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question. endTok	19.848963491392873
startTok However, if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy, go ahead! endTok	39.316497354911704
startTok . Mr President, I have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy. endTok	21.794385764255995
startTok These are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the Statute for Members and of its role in the context of political society. endTok	47.137509635701065
startTok I do not want to enter into this type of discussion because I think that it might, to use a French expression, préjuger the Portuguese Presidency' s views in the course of the negotiations in which it is involved on the Statute for Members. endTok	36.250524970618606
startTok I would ask you to allow me to refrain from commenting on this matter. endTok	15.08613861970444
startTok Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 11 to 35 will be replied to in writing. endTok	59.51244529623206
startTok That concludes Questions to the Council. endTok	35.7375229733875
startTok (The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.) endTok	7.591357588487617
startTok Address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic endTok	39.12236908223087
startTok Mr President in office, ladies and gentlemen, I have great honour in extending a warm welcome, on behalf of the House, to the President of the Czech Republic, Mr Vaclav Havel. endTok	18.114172812623206
startTok I should also like to welcome Mrs Havel, who is sitting in the gallery. endTok	39.041192240802495
startTok You are most welcome. endTok	66.21950415519693
startTok (Applause) endTok	42.81948661699828
startTok This is not your first visit to our Parliament, Mr President. endTok	48.607860076695985
startTok You addressed plenary in Strasbourg nearly six years ago, in March 1994, and many of us, who were already European Members of Parliament at that time, still have a vivid recollection of your speech. endTok	73.21859376214661
startTok In fact, shortly after the Maastricht Treaty was ratified, you spoke in favour of strengthening European values, creating a European ethical dimension and opening the Union to the countries of central and eastern Europe. endTok	59.508018532614365
startTok In other words, for many citizens, and not just in your country, you personify the European values to which we constantly voice our attachment. endTok	84.0967744188714
startTok There have been extremely dynamic developments in relations between the Union and the Czech Republic following two European elections and a major new reform of the European Treaties. endTok	55.298925979636934
startTok An association agreement has been signed and a joint parliamentary committee has been set up by the European Parliament and the Czech Parliament. endTok	27.013117575457436
startTok Your country filed an official application to join the Union in 1996 and accession negotiations were finally officially opened in 1998. endTok	177.43851475093317
startTok The process of European integration and enlargement has speeded up impressively since the fall of the iron curtain. endTok	54.77437447491254
startTok The end of this artificial separation of Europe marked the start of a new era. endTok	38.41671205533684
startTok We now face an historical challenge with multiple prospects for all the citizens of Europe. endTok	52.56838066456186
startTok Mr President, you are a symbol of these changes. endTok	30.20838933935085
startTok You founded and signed Charter 77, the human rights movement which represented and called for fundamental values during a dark period in the history of your people. endTok	242.79721788282316
startTok A Communist regime sentenced you to five years in prison for defending human freedom and dignity. endTok	152.80905108112842
startTok But you never lost hope and history proved you right. endTok	379.60555119479943
startTok Ten years ago, the "velvet revolution" proclaimed Havel na HRAD. endTok	33.58640238112204
startTok For ten years you represented democratic Czechoslovakia and, later, the Czech Republic, as its president. endTok	113.56584198875474
startTok Reconciliation with your neighbours was, and still is, a basic objective which you have defended with vigour and perseverance. endTok	54.91308210306065
startTok You are a first class European. endTok	85.19152382011048
startTok Today, the Czech Republic is preparing to join our Union. endTok	44.69269972319362
startTok I am sure that you will agree, Mr President, and experience has shown us, that the process of enlargement of the Union is not without its pitfalls for both parties and the Czech Republic will need to make a great deal of effort in order to meet the accession criteria. endTok	28.73575417628646
startTok The European Union, for its part, will need to adapt its institutions and policies in order to prepare for enlargement. endTok	41.70172193431026
startTok It has already taken a big step forward with Agenda 2000. endTok	39.57270791472697
startTok The next step, i.e. institutional reform, will be taken following the inauguration of the new Intergovernmental Conference, in which the European Parliament will be fully involved. endTok	28.491894035109613
startTok Our responsibility as members of the European Parliament is to ensure that the process of enlargement takes place in an climate of optimum openness and transparency so that, when the time comes, the citizens of the European Union and the citizens of the Czech Republic will approve the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union through their elected representatives. endTok	33.405016817986386
startTok Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to give you the floor. endTok	30.830353213343955
startTok (Applause) endTok	42.81948661699828
startTok Mr President, allow me, on behalf of the European Parliament, to extend our warmest thanks for the clear message which you have brought and of which the members have already shown their appreciation. endTok	41.4638830194773
startTok Thank you. You are right to remind us that a national identity is perfectly compatible with a European identity. endTok	35.677265806164215
startTok And you have used your personal experience to show us that your European identity was not decreed; it was a spontaneous and natural move. endTok	95.98814747094454
startTok I have taken note of your words; this is something which we all feel very deeply. endTok	30.517102898493455
startTok We find you faithful to the principles which have always guided you, which have always guided your actions; your attachment to fundamental values. endTok	98.14924227212327
startTok You reminded us of your speech in 1994, which you yourself qualify as slightly provocative, but there is such a thing as creative utopia and we have been able to gauge together how far we have come. endTok	55.02828408354266
startTok And you very opportunely highlighted the role of the civil society, the importance of the civil society, not just in the candidate countries, but in all the countries in the European Union, in restoring our citizens' confidence, in restoring confidence in the social solidarity which we need. endTok	48.2731794626368
startTok To summarise, perhaps what struck me most in your speech; above all, you wished to remind us that, beyond its economic aspects, the task of constructing Europe is a spiritual one. endTok	107.67189486888252
startTok We of course look forward most keenly to continuing this task with you. endTok	129.0892045543694
startTok Thank you, Mr President. endTok	18.22323311464254
startTok (The formal sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.) endTok	13.654735568241321
startTok ACP-EU Joint Assembly endTok	164.6022302167882
startTok The next item is the annual report (A5-0032/2000) by Mr Corrie, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the results of the activities of the ACS-EU Joint Assembly in 1999. endTok	10.819894452064636
startTok , rapporteur.- Mr President, I had hoped to be rising at 9 a.m., not 9 p.m., to present this report. endTok	63.60683468622331
startTok I hope the number of Members in this Chamber is not an indication of the interest in overseas development work. endTok	42.08525561228605
startTok However, it is normal practice that the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is put before Members of this Parliament and I have the pleasant task of doing that tonight. endTok	33.638965464036495
startTok Once again, I can report two highly successful Assemblies having taken place, one in Strasbourg and one in Nassau. endTok	126.27738422681155
startTok In many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one. endTok	41.96299979949429
startTok The ACP-EU Joint Assembly is a unique organisation in world politics. endTok	37.25865098568285
startTok Where else do 86 nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern? endTok	249.2954179854738
startTok The Strasbourg Assembly was the last chaired by Lord Plumb. endTok	50.778320006127196
startTok In honour of the tremendous work he carried out over a difficult period the Joint Bureau in Nassau made him an honorary president, and we wish him well in his retirement. endTok	114.69770710499927
startTok The two Assemblies have been dominated by the negotiations on renewal of the Lomé Convention and I look forward to the signature of a new Convention and its rapid ratification by all the countries concerned. endTok	31.29705871106765
startTok I remember that at the last mid-term review, when I was rapporteur, the then Commissioner Marin said that review would be the last. endTok	57.819623453907084
startTok Well, he was wrong, and I pay tribute to Philip Lowe and his team who have worked so successfully behind the scenes to conclude a new Convention in very difficult circumstances. endTok	65.67442294117421
startTok I was also delighted to hear the report this morning from Commissioner Nielson who has worked untiringly to get the right outcome to the negotiations. endTok	28.377742836291734
startTok I pay special tribute to him for his success. endTok	62.593565370570055
startTok I also pay tribute to Mrs Kinnock and her working group for the huge amount of work they put in on the future of Lomé. endTok	62.46869112298748
startTok I am quite sure that Mrs Kinnock' s report and the one on regional cooperation and integration had a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiations. endTok	44.40446234827843
startTok I also thank the Working Groups on the small island states and climate change and the Follow-up Group on Fisheries for their excellent reports. endTok	107.5408473159141
startTok We have had question times to the Council and the Commission and to the ACP Council, and I would like to thank those institutions for their interest in our work. endTok	36.577295267985704
startTok The main thrust of our work in both Assemblies was poverty eradication. endTok	75.95072697245615
startTok The resolution passed went so far as to say that poverty amounted to a violation of human rights. endTok	55.944422881627574
startTok It also emphasised the importance of abolishing gender inequalities and as I travel through Africa and see the work done by women I only wish there were more women in senior government positions and in presidential posts. endTok	118.76325221660997
startTok We might then see an end to some of the fraud, corruption and mismanagement that seem endemic in some countries and that have to be stopped. endTok	52.7434103761386
startTok We had, as usual, many debates on countries where there are war situations. endTok	70.22539080735635
startTok I visited Ethiopia and Eritrea to gain first-hand knowledge. endTok	168.20076739703964
startTok The OAU is doing its best to broker a peace deal there. endTok	99.69534332073724
startTok But Ethiopia is still calling for clarification on certain issues and the humanitarian situation in both countries is serious. endTok	69.89159376705342
startTok We were delighted to hear in Nassau that a trade agreement was being reached with South Africa after four years of negotiations. endTok	92.74327797069253
startTok This highlights the problems of coherence between the EU and the developing nations, which came to a head at the WTO talks in Seattle. endTok	56.20716002170936
startTok Much work has to be done to convince the developing nations of the advantages of globalisation and world free-trade agreements. endTok	83.54643969746337
startTok In Nassau, we had two interesting debates on East Timor and Cuba. endTok	75.11578790071795
startTok Cuba has observer status but I understand has now shown a wish to join the ACP. endTok	177.39240868609264
startTok All nations from within the confines of the ACP territory who can live up to the requirements of democracy, human rights, governance and an independent judiciary are, I am sure, welcome. endTok	74.98480835253835
startTok I await with interest developments in Cuba. endTok	125.6803956131439
startTok When Mr Dalmau, the Cuban Junior Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the Assembly, he did not hesitate to let his feelings be known. endTok	74.97519072832765
startTok On East Timor, Mr Da Costa, from the Timorese National Resistance Council, gave a very moving address indicating that East Timor would also like to join the ACP when it becomes a state with a government. endTok	121.09577302845906
startTok We must give them all our support to reach that goal. endTok	57.69296544736876
startTok Human rights is such an important issue within the ACP-EU Assembly that Joint Vice-Presidents have been appointed with special responsibilities for monitoring human rights closely and reporting to the Assembly. endTok	92.30640963628375
startTok A number of cases have been highlighted, including the child soldier issue in Sudan, where many children have been abducted from neighbouring states. endTok	50.28854411034189
startTok I had the honour of being elected the European Co-President at the beginning of this fifth term and Mr Clair from Mauritius is the new ACP Co-President. endTok	54.85312594403486
startTok I would like to see a number of changes to our Assembly, particularly after the signing of the new Convention in May. endTok	36.029213011779476
startTok We must have more equality between our ACP partners and our European members and I want to get rid of the "them and us" syndrome. endTok	58.87727476285592
startTok Firstly, I would like to see a Joint Parliamentary Assembly of elected members from ACP countries and not ambassadors or government ministers sitting there as delegates. endTok	109.28011120662676
startTok This I think is the new Convention. endTok	56.311327283163145
startTok Secondly, the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions, which would allow us to be much more specific in our work. endTok	44.18595981272814
startTok These assemblies would report back to the Joint Assembly. endTok	70.31609614305712
startTok We had a regional debate in Nassau in the Caribbean and this was extremely productive. endTok	67.57397883707206
startTok We are going to have one in Abuja in West Africa too. endTok	46.94969680914768
startTok I want the Assembly to stop being just a talk-shop and become a work-shop for the betterment of all the people in developing countries. endTok	66.57851319468405
startTok I want to see civil society given a louder voice. endTok	42.76754432561532
startTok But to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head-on. endTok	36.62093353298338
startTok We must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance. endTok	36.75817244692443
startTok Equally, we should come down hard on those who are corrupt or whose constitutions do not allow the pluralist governments that we demand. endTok	64.4201052322335
startTok I am delighted to see the result in Zimbabwe. endTok	16.51738262230716
startTok European taxpayers will no longer accept their taxes being fraudulently used. endTok	69.28367078268836
startTok A new wind of change must blow through Africa and new standards must be set and lived up to. endTok	79.56391715609557
startTok The Joint Assembly should play a leading role in monitoring the enactment of good governance, human rights and democracy in cooperation with the Commission. endTok	31.910564056763988
startTok I believe that as equal partners the EU- and ACP-elected delegates are up to that task. endTok	104.37465615951504
startTok I beg to move acceptance of this report. endTok	32.78075027283211
startTok Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mr Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report. endTok	12.282132583036253
startTok Our approach to development policy must always be based on respect for human rights and the fight against poverty. endTok	33.50231567540347
startTok But there is a crass contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many Member States and in the EU. endTok	29.355323937755244
startTok With regard to financing, we must look to the future and provide the Joint Assembly with additional funds so that, for instance, we can send delegations to the ACP states to oversee electoral processes, at their invitation. endTok	63.05014960330931
startTok In future, the EU must take a far more multilateral approach when it agrees development projects and, furthermore, must coordinate more closely with the individual states in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively. endTok	80.66536764635009
startTok An example here could be the field of education, which will deserve and need special support in the ACP states in future. endTok	105.75238676708905
startTok For instance, the very rapidly growing educational and technological potential of the Internet offers entirely new means of helping the developing countries, which at present still have modest resources, to move towards a global approach, as opposed to globalisation. endTok	110.20187377684421
startTok I see it as a future task of the EU to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises in the ACP states, which can promote self-help. endTok	37.51584919059155
startTok An example here is the problem in Nigeria, which imports industrial finished products from all over the world and then has to spend substantial resources on product maintenance by foreign workers. endTok	131.391818719746
startTok One way forward to promote the setting up of SMEs could be to train the Nigerian population adequately. endTok	97.06689232980702
startTok It will be easier to take account of the developing countries' very diverse problems, and EU aid could be prepared and implemented in a more targeted manner if, as the report makes quite clear, we take the urgently needed step of optimising our working methods, by introducing the proposed regional assemblies. endTok	73.92376101510897
startTok Thank you, Mr Zimmerling: If I am informed correctly, this is the first time you are addressing this House. endTok	31.21427525009112
startTok Congratulations on your maiden speech: It went really well. endTok	168.00141734147536
startTok Mr President, it cannot be repeated often enough: since 1975, the Lomé Convention has constituted an important pillar of European development cooperation and has a pilot role to play in many respects. endTok	50.05859300994893
startTok Based as it is on the principle of partnership and equality, and on parliamentary control by the Joint Assembly, it is an example to the world. endTok	51.67812117997089
startTok Most appropriately, given that this year we are celebrating 25 years of cooperation under Lomé, we will shortly be signing a new and more advanced partnership agreement, which also upgrades the Joint Assembly into a genuine parliamentary assembly on both sides. endTok	93.38357820008235
startTok So I do not want to look back only to the year 1999. endTok	35.07931722245863
startTok The rapporteur, Mr Corrie, has already done so most expertly. endTok	41.64152402787939
startTok Much of what concerns us today is the outcome of fundamental processes of transformation in all parts of the world since the late 1980s. endTok	66.56149891863151
startTok They also had strong repercussions in the developing countries. endTok	33.09968082803439
startTok The after-shocks can still be felt. endTok	94.11581516954895
startTok ACP cooperation is a dynamic process. endTok	150.81927818628904
startTok The content of the agreements has progressed steadily between Lomé I and Lomé VI. endTok	168.05045139866561
startTok At the same time the number of partner states has increased considerably, now standing at 71. endTok	95.17637729766022
startTok All those involved were particularly moved by the enlargement to Namibia and South Africa. endTok	65.27847177744621
startTok Cuba has just knocked at the door, and, if Cuba is also accepted into the ACP-EU community, that will be a momentous step and will bring in its wake processes of change in Cuba itself. endTok	103.83268242838322
startTok So ACP cooperation remains very exciting, and not only because of the new emphases introduced in the new Convention. endTok	56.62096581108006
startTok Fighting poverty and promoting sustained economic, cultural and social development are important objectives in the endeavour to build up democratic societies, based on respect for human rights, in the ACP states. endTok	78.23707148440847
startTok That also means strengthening the democratic institutions. endTok	117.26851270129777
startTok The history of the Joint Assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction. endTok	40.07972211334341
startTok In the past, the representatives of the ACP countries tended to be government members, government officials or ambassadors; but today at least three quarters of the ACP delegates are elected members of parliament. endTok	108.61991465067413
startTok We ought to throw a big party when the figure reaches 100% in the near future, which is indeed what the new Convention is aiming at. endTok	73.0082642233646
startTok Unfortunately there is far too little appreciation of the steady advance of processes of democratisation which, unlike the various crises that arise, largely pass unnoticed. endTok	109.07863603648563
startTok One special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the ACP states is regional cooperation and integration. endTok	134.20394985946015
startTok There is one wish on the European Parliament' s long wish list that will be fulfilled: as we have already heard, the Joint Assembly will soon also be able to hold regional assemblies. endTok	65.87103669935685
startTok Enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts based on ethnic, economic, social or religious factors, i.e. have a preventive effect. endTok	109.31132884647872
startTok For the same reason the European Parliament has always called for civil society to be involved in the decision-making processes and in cooperation management, and emphasised the importance of decentralised cooperation. endTok	31.004610333067003
startTok The enhanced contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social partners provided for in the new Convention are another step in the right direction. endTok	51.47137016420768
startTok But I am a little sad that the European Development Fund has still not been incorporated in the Community budget. endTok	20.48245043782773
startTok I hope it does not take another 25 years before we finally achieve that too. endTok	77.83694307176587
startTok Mr President, I congratulate Mr Corrie on his report. endTok	10.74356442525515
startTok The Lomé Convention has been an expression of a real partnership between the EU and the ACP countries for over 25 years. endTok	31.179688832026862
startTok That it has continued at all in the face of overwhelming pressure against it from many quarters, including the WTO, is a triumph of sorts. endTok	105.08954674020637
startTok But of course the new Convention must be measured not by the fact that it exists but by the extent to which it can contribute to the EU commitment to poverty eradication and the achievement of the international development targets. endTok	39.049682192556425
startTok Measured by this yardstick there are a number of serious shortcomings in the new arrangements. For example, the agreement is particularly disappointing for those ACP countries suffering from short-term fluctuations in export earnings. endTok	71.61418460110268
startTok During a marathon negotiating session in December a compromise was reached which provided that, in respect of least-developed, landlocked and island states, assistance would be provided in the event of a minimum 2% loss of export earnings rather than the level of 10% for the other ACP states. endTok	107.6284170089845
startTok But at the final negotiating session the EU claimed that it had never actually agreed to the inclusion of islands and landlocked states among those which would qualify for the support on the basis of the 2% threshold. endTok	75.04994747292442
startTok This change has been devastating for the Windward Islands in particular which may be the only ACP state which will actually lose massively from the new arrangements. endTok	55.176658386909516
startTok This seems a particularly perverse outcome since the Windward Islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable of the ACP states and they are now going to have to pay the highest price for this new Lomé arrangement. endTok	34.10282827625367
startTok Meanwhile, on the trade side, pressure from the WTO to ensure that any Lomé Convention is WTO-compatible has meant that there is a huge momentum behind the idea of the so-called regional economic partnership arrangements or free-trade agreements. endTok	105.42155170733635
startTok Non-least-developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements. endTok	151.62718388440175
startTok Yet it is quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of countries will simply be unable to open their markets yet to the chill winds of free trade without wrecking their own domestic economy. endTok	49.154247621949075
startTok We therefore need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that genuine options are open to those countries which are not yet ready for free-trade arrangements. endTok	45.27380655078777
startTok We need to ensure that strategies for promoting regional integration within the ACP are pursued in their own right. endTok	63.12665039177642
startTok Finally, during any new trade round the EU and the ACP states should press jointly for a reform of GATT Article 24 in order to explicitly provide regional non-reciprocal trade agreements between structurally and economically dissimilar groups of countries. endTok	149.44343402281086
startTok The Lomé Convention is a unique partnership; but if it is to be truly effective it needs to extend beyond the discussions within the context of Lomé and involve a participation of the WTO and a partnership in all other international negotiating fora. endTok	74.8150903697337
startTok Mr President, what I want to do in this debate is condemn the fate reserved for the poor countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. endTok	35.264614504697164
startTok People have the gall to say they benefit from the Lomé Convention, but even looking at trading relations alone, the Lomé Convention has done nothing to protect those countries; their already feeble share in trade with Europe has been halved. endTok	116.58112241020912
startTok That reflects the growth of inequality between EU and ACP countries. endTok	56.27476764039618
startTok The Lomé Convention essentially benefits a few large industrial or financial conglomerates, which continue to pillage those countries and perpetuate their economic dependence, notably on the former colonial powers. endTok	87.93591199434228
startTok When it comes to so-called development aid, given that underdevelopment in the majority of these countries is getting worse rather than better, development is clearly not what the aid is for, even when it is not just a disguised export subsidy for European manufacturers. endTok	60.0032934896313
startTok The aid is primarily a windfall for incumbent regimes, and the poor majority does not benefit at all. endTok	84.22045491686283
startTok Even if it were properly redirected this aid would not be enough to finance the most basic infrastructure for health care, education or drinking water supply. endTok	80.3410753225566
startTok For some years now the great powers have been reducing the amount of this already derisory aid, and it is the height of cynicism when this is done on the pretext of human rights violations or corruption. endTok	58.67413931983997
startTok After all, who protects these deeply corrupt regimes, if not the governments of the rich countries? endTok	70.46025217101094
startTok They turn a blind eye to the masters of corruption, the big groups controlling oil, water supply, or public works. They could clamp down on them since their head offices are here in Europe. endTok	131.22070095748998
startTok The debate about either extending the Lomé Convention with its quotas and protectionism, or, instead, gradually winding down the special relationship between the European Union and the ACP countries in the name of free trade, is a warped debate between two ways of perpetuating the pillage and impoverishment of those countries. endTok	53.4492107193088
startTok I protest against an ignoble and inhuman organisation which literally condemns hundreds of millions of human beings to a wretched death to enrich a minority. endTok	68.90038212534901
startTok A mere fraction of the fantastic wealth accumulated by the big groups could lift these poor countries out of extreme poverty, but, until we have the courage to take on those big capitalist groups, we are just covering up the real problems. endTok	110.8129122062008
startTok Mr President, I want to thank the Co-President of the Joint ACP-EU Assembly, Mr Corrie. It was no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the ACP-EU Assembly. endTok	45.7782745474111
startTok In this speech, I will confine myself to addressing certain points I consider fundamental. endTok	93.611843982921
startTok I believe the European Parliament should call for the Assembly to become truly parliamentary, urging all ACP countries to send members of their national parliaments as their representatives, so as to strengthen their own democratic fabric. endTok	83.82081566470913
startTok My next contribution to the debate is to turn my attention to globalisation and the WTO, which is seen by the ACP countries as an enormous danger to their development. endTok	60.088015561405086
startTok I do believe the ACP countries need a transition period, but they also need support in the context of the new logic of regionalisation of aid, not only in agriculture and fisheries, but also in the exploitation of mineral and underground resources, some of which are being exploited, with slim economic returns to the ACP countries themselves. endTok	46.82549958562864
startTok Thirdly, the European Parliament - through a joint working group within the Joint Assembly - must make a major effort to achieve stability in ACP countries' budgets through the selection of budgetary items to permit economic and, above all, social development, and by monitoring income and fiscal policies in force in the ACP countries. endTok	94.05242402958153
startTok We must put the people of the ACP countries first in our relationship with their rulers, who need to be fully aware that development aid from the European Union is intended for the people and not for the oligarchies that handle all the internal and external resources in some countries. endTok	42.41186588174876
startTok Fourthly, and finally, the prevention of inter-ethnic conflicts between States must be our constant concern and to some extent this can be achieved either through a strong and authoritative diplomatic offensive or with the proposals I have set out. endTok	84.30768620999557
startTok Mr President, I agree with the positive evaluation Mrs Junker has just made and I want to add that Mr Corrie has started his term as Co-President of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly with effective and impartial work deserving of our full appreciation. endTok	47.93550001477402
startTok I shall restrict my speech to one particular act which took place a few days ago, partly as a consequence of events alluded to in the report we are debating here. endTok	47.37545317108398
startTok I refer to Cuba' s expression of intent, of 2 February, to become a full member of the ACP group of countries. endTok	77.65414130445961
startTok A Cuban delegation attended the last meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, and Vice-Chancellor Dalmau spoke in the plenary session, engaging in a lively debate, and afterwards held conversations with many of us. endTok	52.37824458174932
startTok Following Nassau, a delegation from Parliament led by Mr Corrie and the Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Joaquín Miranda, visited Havana and a series of very illuminating exchanges of opinion took place. endTok	54.752230500667046
startTok It is my impression that this mission from the European Parliament was the final push which convinced our Cuban friends that the time had come to move forward on mechanisms of cooperation with the European Union. endTok	57.1495197096873
startTok We are witnessing events of great political significance and I hope that we in the European Parliament can promote the appropriate favourable view and a generous attitude on the part of the Union, so that Cuba' s aspirations can meet with a positive response as soon as possible. endTok	41.83711902129974
startTok That is important, for at least three reasons. endTok	47.592534239477665
startTok First, it is important for Cuba, to bring its people development and prosperity and finally break the United States blockade, which has been repeatedly condemned by the European Parliament and the United Nations. endTok	52.74660452512932
startTok Secondly, we must bear in mind that Cuba' s application has the support of all the ACP countries. endTok	30.954901558313882
startTok If the European Union responds positively to the recommendation of our associates, we will be proving our respect and consideration for those associates and this will have positive effects on the whole framework of our cooperation with them. endTok	61.25371904296904
startTok Nor can we ignore the value of such a decision in demonstrating the consistency and autonomy of the European Union and the fact that it does not bow to pressure from any quarter. endTok	28.520132922018465
startTok By accepting Cuba into the ACP community we will be demonstrating that our Europe is not involved in the shameful process of 'playing but not paying' , and that, when we get indignant about absurdities like the Helms-Burton Act, we are not being hypocritical but are ready to act and take all the consequences. endTok	95.84426075145758
startTok The ACP-EU Joint Assembly meets again in a few weeks time and I am sure this subject will be dealt with there. endTok	39.80225157374516
startTok Ideally the European Parliament' s representatives should be able to support Cuba' s intent at those proceedings, as our parliamentary colleagues from the ACP countries will no doubt be doing. endTok	65.54827811055097
startTok Of course, Cuba must meet all the standard conditions, just like any other member. endTok	150.8761746583547
startTok The Cubans know that and I am sure they accept it. endTok	59.746566963488796
startTok It must also be made clear that Cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners. endTok	34.06984965745597
startTok Cuba' s wish to join is welcome and Cuba will be welcome in our circle. endTok	188.4321622208707
startTok I say that wholeheartedly, but also with the deep conviction that, just as the blockade has produced nothing but poverty and, as a consequence of that, extreme tension and a hardening of the Cuban position, the integration we are supporting here, and the prosperity it will produce, will translate into the détente and openness we all seek and from which all of us, especially the Cuban people, will benefit. endTok	118.66933898374474
startTok Mr President, I also want to begin by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Corrie, for an excellent report which I think very well describes and summarises the work which has been done in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in the course of 1999. endTok	15.654832084983745
startTok I do not have very long in which to speak, and I really only want to take up two questions. endTok	42.07855349622988
startTok The first is about the fight against poverty, which I think is becoming an embarrassment both for the EU and the Member States. endTok	26.67163942851031
startTok In spite of the fact that, both in the Treaty and at the UN' s meetings in Rio and Copenhagen, there was an undertaking to work to eradicate poverty in the world, the budget for development aid is, in actual fact, being cut back, when the express desire was that exactly the opposite should happen. endTok	54.31121324119374
startTok We must put a stop to this trend. endTok	25.34853887519718
startTok We must begin by writing off debts. We must follow up words with action. endTok	51.92869564972066
startTok I should like us to take a leading role in this work. endTok	23.154905734358668
startTok My second question concerns the fact that, in many contexts, we talk about the ACP countries having to learn the principles of democracy. endTok	32.115511326229
startTok Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution demand, within the context of the new agreement, that working methods should be developed and optimised. endTok	65.2860361255204
startTok The ACP countries are to be urged to allow a whole range of political opinions to come up for discussion. endTok	39.945002730028385
startTok I think that is a very good idea indeed, and I fully subscribe to it. endTok	32.54792762981107
startTok However, we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements. endTok	47.216480927846185
startTok How do these operate within the European Parliament' s delegation to the ACP-EU' s Joint Assembly? endTok	58.381633340393385
startTok In contrast to how things are done here in the European Parliament and in Parliament' s committees, where rapporteurs are nominated and appointed to produce reports, there are no regulations whatsoever applied within this delegation to the Joint Assembly. The two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves. endTok	98.9409248196428
startTok In order to change this undemocratic arrangement, we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have tabled Amendment No 6 in which we request that the rapporteurs appointed to produce reports and consultative documents, together with the members of working parties, should be appointed in accordance with clear, democratic rules. endTok	52.51721966647443
startTok In this context, account ought to be taken of the smaller groups, and consideration given to introducing more representative arrangements. endTok	87.77918753826137
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the quality of his report, which appropriately reflects the tenor of the debates in the Joint Assembly he so effectively co-chaired. endTok	29.39536367129141
startTok The eradication of poverty was central to our work and many speakers highlighted the need to preserve an essential tool for achieving that ambitious aim, to whit, preferential agreements between the European Union and the ACP countries within the framework of the Lomé Conventions. endTok	63.57108554548292
startTok The challenge was immense. endTok	54.94409342040075
startTok Globalisation, free trade, and the hegemony of the WTO with its internationalist philosophy, were imperilling the very essence of the North-South dialogue. endTok	102.84225957539118
startTok So we can only applaud the conclusion of a new partnership agreement for development, and personally I am convinced that the work of the last Joint Assembly did have a decisive influence on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations, as did the new climate created by the events at Seattle. endTok	69.30594131857518
startTok However, while I welcome the renewal of the agreements, what I find most interesting is the new wind blowing through our relationships and finding expression in the balanced nature of the negotiations now drawing to a close. endTok	107.15101114833158
startTok The European Union seems to me to have finally emerged from the old paternalist, or frankly neo-colonialist, logic where those giving aid are all too eager to start giving lessons, following a formula our friend Michel Rocard is so keen on. endTok	114.31337456960648
startTok The Union has finally accepted the idea that dialogue cannot be genuine or effective unless it is the expression of a contract which respects the dignity of the partners. endTok	62.88138245673721
startTok By refusing to allow the idea of good governance to become a tool, in the hands of technocrats, for imposing new sets of conditions, the European Union is demonstrating wisdom and modesty. endTok	55.845088308228235
startTok We have spent two centuries laying the foundations of a democracy whose fragility is constantly brought home to us by events. endTok	82.59888813781053
startTok What right have we to try to impose our model on people whose history, values and identity are sometimes so profoundly different from our own? endTok	214.96603965907846
startTok Personally, I prefer the willingness that is clearly flagged up in these agreements to extend the partnership to new agents - local authorities, non-governmental organisations - which seems to me to represent the only possible way the people of these countries can progressively achieve ownership cooperation. endTok	88.64893247943075
startTok In short, this is the only way they can emerge from humiliating and childlike dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves, the proof of success. endTok	53.15023874782572
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the accuracy and rigour of the summary in his report. endTok	12.187563425091941
startTok The European Parliament' s opinion on the activities of the ACP-European Union Joint Assembly has always had a major impact, undeniably contributing to a consistent policy and role for the European Union in development and cooperation. endTok	36.167105736341796
startTok The important role of the increasingly parliamentary Joint Assembly in strengthening relations between the European Union and the ACP countries needs to be stressed. endTok	38.44087261261802
startTok In view of this positive action, there is every advantage to be gained from according the Joint Assembly a budget compatible with improving the quality of its work. endTok	70.72314228014345
startTok We back the rapporteur' s proposal to introduce regional parliamentary assemblies, under the aegis of the Joint Assembly, in the six regions of the Convention: the Caribbean, the Pacific and four African regions. endTok	64.54580247873258
startTok These regional assemblies would monitor action in their respective areas. endTok	109.2517155908263
startTok Poverty has been the common denominator of all the debates in the Joint Assembly and its eradication is the priority for the European Union' s development policy. endTok	31.442565235564544
startTok In line with the resolution at the Nassau meeting, we must concentrate on meeting the poverty reduction targets agreed by the international community. endTok	62.84199558507927
startTok Consistency and action are needed. endTok	113.8012696098259
startTok The next Lomé Convention must specify the investment in education and stimulate regional cooperation and the participation of local bodies. endTok	60.992805854708166
startTok The participation of local bodies is absolutely essential. endTok	42.52712456767699
startTok In a wider context, the priorities, as I see it, are to convert poor countries' debt into programmes for poverty eradication and sustainable development, as well as control of fraud and corruption. endTok	87.47149769984128
startTok We need to make progress with concrete and consistent action. endTok	43.43142477873731
startTok People in the poor countries are beginning to despair. endTok	35.76072327306204
startTok I call on the Commission to act on the rapid accession of East Timor to the Lomé Convention as one means, amongst others, of promoting the eradication of poverty and accelerating its economic, cultural and social development, in order to strengthen its internal democratisation. endTok	47.30857642799582
startTok Finally, I must congratulate the Council Presidency on the coming Europe-Africa Summit and call on all the participants to contribute to solid practical action to promote the development of peace, democracy and the eradication of poverty in the underdeveloped countries of Africa. endTok	54.20153124780652
startTok . (DA) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and also to thank the Joint Assembly for its work in 1999. endTok	15.7919115373256
startTok I am also delighted to be able to confirm that I shall be participating in the Joint Assembly' s next meeting, which takes place in March in Nigeria. endTok	19.207902613168514
startTok The Commission is pleased to see the Joint Assembly playing a larger role, especially in connection with promoting a more extensive political dialogue with our partners in development. endTok	57.32744547164759
startTok The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that combating poverty continues to be the central objective for development policy and will always play a key role. endTok	59.29238645397944
startTok In order to be able to develop, the countries concerned must, however, become actively involved in the global economic system. endTok	45.92937115657236
startTok With regard to trade with our partners in development, the Commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the ACP countries' special economic and social limitations. endTok	43.73646826417763
startTok Mrs Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmin system ought to be continued with. endTok	37.48705009463606
startTok I do not agree. endTok	14.114911859722728
startTok That system has proved itself to be inappropriate because it is, in actual fact, of use only to relatively few of the 71 countries concerned. endTok	83.93104230875728
startTok It operates too slowly, and it therefore stands to reason that the developing countries should have said yes to the new system of the future, because this will operate more flexibly. endTok	68.21710573624154
startTok Regarding the future accession of countries such as East Timor to the Lomé Convention, I can only repeat what I recently said to the European Parliament' s Committee on Development and Cooperation, namely, that the door is open. endTok	47.192542750134265
startTok It is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door. endTok	43.5788064651098
startTok Once they have done so, we shall adopt a position on the matter. endTok	35.86962963954246
startTok With regard to Cuba' s application for accession to the Lomé Convention, the Commission notes that, according to their recent declaration, the ACP States support Cuba' s application. endTok	69.95424309096447
startTok The EU has always called for a constructive attitude to be adopted towards Cuba, as outlined in the EU' s common position, but it has to be recognised that the discussions will be complex. endTok	46.22733064602173
startTok With regard to the Côte d' Ivoire, I can inform you that the whole of the EUR 28 million has been paid back in accordance with what was agreed following examination of the financial irregularities. endTok	26.95585210080377
startTok With regard to financing the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget, I can say that this is being considered. endTok	42.99316563747891
startTok For its part, the Commission supports this, but we cannot at this point produce new reports on the whys and wherefores. endTok	60.12358346254802
startTok Concerning Article 366A, I can say that, during the negotiations for a new partnership agreement, a new procedure was established for dealing with instances where human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law are infringed. endTok	45.99540578479255
startTok It is now the case, following adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty, that Parliament wishes, on the basis of Article 300, to be kept fully informed of all decisions, and the Commission will continue to take account of Parliament' s decisions on this subject. endTok	34.67531800609598
startTok There are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in Parliament in connection with such decisions. endTok	83.07608622125002
startTok This would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted Amsterdam Treaty. endTok	213.70088281167355
startTok Finally, I would refer to the South Africa agreement, which the rapporteur also touched upon. endTok	41.26588088390838
startTok In this regard, I am simply pleased - delighted, in fact - here this evening, as a conclusion to this debate, to be able, very appropriately, to inform you that South Africa' s President has today said yes to the solution which the EU' s Council of Foreign Ministers last Monday agreed unanimously to propose with regard to the outstanding problems regarding South Africa. endTok	75.15211613341688
startTok So the "Grappa War" is over. endTok	74.08601646541408
startTok Peace has broken out, and we can now look forward to cooperation with South Africa in accordance with the common dreams and values which ought to have underpinned the whole business from the start. endTok	59.276753649562465
startTok I think this rather nicely puts the finishing touches to a debate which has, on the whole, been quite positive, and I would repeat my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament for the cooperation which has gone into our relations with the Third World on precisely the work in question. endTok	43.609644492492166
startTok Thank you, Commissioner. endTok	17.829155313593716
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.7754887131066557
startTok The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. endTok	3.2691741867479744
startTok Stabilisation and association agreement with FYROM endTok	68.1236829978097
startTok The next item is the report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the recommendation for a Council Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with FYROM (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121(COS)). endTok	5.224604403207394
startTok Mr President, Commissioner Patten, today we are discussing a country that really has suffered hard times, a country that is, however, moving in a very promising direction, thanks to its own efforts and resolve and certainly also thanks to the support of the international community. endTok	63.027424821025384
startTok So if the European Union, the Council and the Commission are proposing - and I assume that Parliament will support that proposal tomorrow - the first stabilisation and association agreement in south-eastern Europe, in the Balkan region - I am quite happy to use that term - it is primarily in gratitude for or acknowledgement of the fact that FYROM itself has worked its way into a good position, in economic and, of course, mainly in political terms, in face of the war in the neighbouring region and also in relation to its own minority. endTok	55.70577958328662
startTok For it is no small thing to have a minority of 33% or even 35% in one' s own country. endTok	67.34433860639172
startTok That country and its politicians - no doubt with some differences here and there - have always done very good work, and we should recognise that. endTok	107.3836369181868
startTok The Commission is proposing that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the Council. endTok	26.432260348585018
startTok Let me make a few comments on aspects on which views may differ somewhat, although, even in this regard, I want to strongly emphasise and acknowledge Commissioner Patten' s activities and interest in relation to FYROM and the region as a whole. endTok	72.69007206594443
startTok Firstly, there is the regional approach. endTok	67.13487548802948
startTok I believe that if it is understood properly, the regional approach is both important and necessary. endTok	65.01699919296435
startTok There has to be a willingness to cooperate. endTok	35.484969108700284
startTok Provided it is not seen as some kind of constraint but as a willingness to cooperate, as an opportunity that each country should grasp, then this is the right approach. endTok	66.13304262865988
startTok The problem is that, when we look at FYROM, we can see how very difficult it is to cooperate economically with some neighbouring countries, such as Kosovo and Albania, or to cooperate politically with, for instance, Yugoslavia. endTok	95.95487792775754
startTok On the other hand, cooperation with Bulgaria, and in particular with Greece, has made good progress and I think we should acknowledge that too. endTok	45.57564027182113
startTok In this context, the European Union must consider, as it began to do early this week, how to include the neighbouring Yugoslavia in regional cooperation in spite of everything, i.e. without taking back any of our criticism of this terrible regime. endTok	71.44691696328248
startTok Tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while easing them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation. endTok	91.36853481917753
startTok In that regard allow me to say, since I come from a country through which the Danube flows, that I am grateful that the Commission, i.e. Commissioner Patten and also Vice-President Palacio, with whom I was recently in Budapest, is considering opening the Danube to shipping again. That would provide for a modicum of economic recovery in this region too, which, of course, would be of particular importance to Romania. endTok	63.15986067374317
startTok In my view, this regional approach, provided it is understood correctly, i.e. as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself, is in fact the right one to adopt. endTok	67.55271580565419
startTok As I said, it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition. endTok	38.6713276661242
startTok Secondly, let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer FYROM accession to the European Union. endTok	54.82339462250224
startTok In our view, it would be an illusion to think there was any point in FYROM applying for accession right now, but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date. endTok	88.21948710651826
startTok FYROM wants to be told here and now that, in principle, accession will be possible when the time is right. endTok	150.1398383952217
startTok This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined. endTok	59.45812671808976
startTok It sees, in the whole readjustment of aid instruments, a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train heading towards Europe but that this train will continue through Europe while leaving FYROM on a siding. endTok	113.36278972370074
startTok I think Commissioner Patten understands that too. endTok	37.36565091799324
startTok So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks. endTok	44.25079607057186
startTok Thirdly, I believe that, so far at least, FYROM has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly. endTok	54.24075275813667
startTok Even though there will of course be readjustments here, FYROM will continue to show that many of the tasks that are still being dealt with in Brussels today can in future be handled in Skopje, in the country itself. endTok	51.91421217387273
startTok I hope that the honourable Members will agree to support these proposals as a sign of goodwill towards FYROM. endTok	32.191404510319934
startTok Mr President, since the start of the Yugoslav wars, the Republic of Macedonia - I prefer to use this abbreviation - has behaved as a constructive peace-keeper. endTok	70.77020210416622
startTok We would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, which had non-violent liberalisation and a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure in view. endTok	72.67045640179292
startTok As you can see, our Macedonian friends have always played a very positive role and it is for this reason that it should be pointed out at this stage that Macedonia is not just a pawn in our so-called strive towards stability, but actually took the initiative. endTok	44.45808532860383
startTok The former President, Mr Gligorov, can take special credit for this, and the current President too has already adopted the profile of President of all Macedonian citizens, so much so that the European Union should only be grateful to have him as interlocutor in the Balkans. endTok	61.137552092724796
startTok Despite the obvious reasons for any internal tension, both population groups have struck a reasonable modus vivendi and the outlook for reaching a sound solution to the remaining problems is good. endTok	98.35332019646268
startTok It was, in fact, in Macedonia that I heard at the time about the Roma population actually not having too bad a time there. endTok	136.88495324995762
startTok I was unaccustomed to hearing this type of comment about the Roma in Europe. endTok	37.0719699262272
startTok With regard to the problems afflicting Macedonia, higher education for the Albanian-speaking citizens deserves our special attention. endTok	204.53825108921865
startTok Accessible higher education, with which you have a certain affinity, is an important instrument in the emancipation of population groups. I am speaking from personal experience as someone who attended the Protestant university in Amsterdam. endTok	94.87591369473103
startTok I might never have studied otherwise. endTok	145.8503562094684
startTok Such an affinity and this type of higher education is also important in the development of the constitutional state and for the aptly termed mainstream society which needs to be strengthened in countries like this. endTok	45.702471443982
startTok The agreement with Macedonia should partly compensate for the damage which this country incurred following the boycott we instituted against Serbia, which is at no cost to us but costs Serbia' s neighbouring states all the more. endTok	149.71932275552538
startTok It would be beneficial if we could reorganise this, especially vis-à-vis the neighbouring states. endTok	27.366215568256766
startTok It is only fair that we should regulate aid to Macedonia properly now. endTok	103.66680374411838
startTok We are therefore quite prepared to support the liberals' amendment to keep aid independent from the donor states' interests, for we need to give industry in Macedonia and the region the best possible opportunities with the aid money available for reconstruction. endTok	156.0806838001088
startTok I am more than happy to include Bulgaria and Romania in this, as it seems to me a tactical and psychological error only to talk about the five countries of former Yugoslavia, plus Albania. endTok	66.34744692027499
startTok It is important to us that the economies in the region can stand on their own two feet again, which can quite easily be done with the aid money. endTok	48.88783110995395
startTok The agreement with Macedonia should be seen as a door opening to the European Union, allowing this country to join, even though this will not be the case in the foreseeable future. endTok	42.12624400103526
startTok In the meantime, we constantly need to start from the premise in our policy that it is desirable for Macedonian legislation to resemble that of the Member States, and our policy should reflect this, even in the naming of aid programmes for Macedonia. endTok	54.38085766863484
startTok I would quote the PHARE programme as an example. endTok	47.22445175926228
startTok Mr President, the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the Greek sensitivities surrounding it. endTok	41.81192042860166
startTok I assume that the Member States will feel increasingly freer to use the name in their own language which fits the republic. endTok	54.157896102880784
startTok If certain countries wish to use the words "former Yugoslavia" , then that is their business; others need not feel obliged to copy them. endTok	263.1120167462656
startTok It will not do to keep us under constant pressure. endTok	74.61853217554457
startTok Hence my support for the sound report by Mr Swoboda; we have come to expect nothing less of him, and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected Republic of Macedonia. endTok	141.84897505001197
startTok Mr President, let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of Mr Swoboda' s work as rapporteur. endTok	24.85633358483106
startTok Today we are expressing a positive opinion on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia. endTok	27.913099056308376
startTok We do so in the awareness that this decision, the very first relating to that area, is actually set in the context of an entirely new phase of our relations with the Balkans. endTok	74.33921258178893
startTok This new phase, or rather policy, identifies the prospect of integrating the region into Europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully. endTok	138.24547305446387
startTok Our agreement to the negotiations, as set out in the rapporteur' s explanatory statement, is born of the conviction that it is right for Union policy to combine both a regional dimension and a more precise assessment of efforts made and results achieved by individual countries in moving towards the acquis communautaire. endTok	82.28628196960716
startTok This is the dual objective which I believe should be pursued. On the one hand, we must maintain programmes on, for example, infrastructure, preparations - still premature - for free trade, and encouragement of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries in the area, and on the other, it is now appropriate to create a model of closer integration with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an example of the policy. endTok	45.9932893647428
startTok And there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive. endTok	38.152901157931765
startTok As we were able to ascertain during our missions to Skopje, there has been considerable progress in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as regards the economy, movement towards democracy and - an area which is difficult and contentious enough in the Balkans - multi-ethnic coexistence. endTok	53.54336447953193
startTok On the other hand, the price Macedonia has been paying for the war in neighbouring Kosovo is very high, both in terms of logistic availability of NATO forces and in terms of reduced exports to Northern Europe. endTok	55.43161341111612
startTok I conclude, Mr President, by affirming that this progress is indeed difficult, fragile, and uncertain and it calls for constant vigilance on our part during the various stages of close and precise inspection that have long been advocated. endTok	79.35624481952283
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, I rise to express the warmth and optimism with which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the start of negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. endTok	16.80528099563704
startTok We are extremely hopeful that, along the lines set out by the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, this agreement can represent an example to be rapidly extended to the other countries, especially Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Kosovo and, as soon as possible, Serbia. endTok	62.92598474288241
startTok We are convinced a rapid start to these negotiations and their speedy conclusion is the only way to achieve peace in the region - peace which did not automatically come with the end of the Kosovo war - thus avoiding the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence, with all the consequences of that in terms of continental, if not world, instability. endTok	79.80763060904341
startTok If the maintenance of peace and security is the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the Union to the countries of Eastern Europe, that motivation must be present even more strongly in relations with Albania and the countries of former Yugoslavia. And that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreements we are discussing represent. endTok	64.29342645852873
startTok It is in that quasi-provocative spirit that we have presented an amendment suggesting the transfer of responsibility for south-east Europe from Foreign Affairs to Enlargement. endTok	66.09120932890544
startTok Very rapid and direct involvement of south-east Europe in the life of the European institutions has also led us to suggest that a limited number of observers invited from the national parliaments should be accepted into the European Parliament, and that staff from those countries could work in the Court of Justice and the Commission. endTok	50.49303583508317
startTok But if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market-based economy is to be encouraged, we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development. endTok	70.9599051745934
startTok With this in mind, we have presented some amendments which I hope Parliament will accept. endTok	59.86828346410975
startTok First, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by Macedonia to European products, on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of Macedonia is accepted. endTok	108.46997098929697
startTok Secondly, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be encouraged, with adequate financial support, to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the Europeanisation of the whole Macedonian economy, with the additional aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system. endTok	58.19871511520184
startTok Thirdly, world aid and assistance coming into the region, and hence into Macedonia as well, should be clearly multilateral, and should not subject the beneficiary country to direct obligations towards the donor country. endTok	241.17647958090257
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, we hope the agreement can achieve all its objectives but we cannot delude ourselves that peace, stability and prosperity in south-east Europe can be achieved without dealing with the very wide-ranging problems we are trying to eliminate. endTok	50.77140766805962
startTok I am referring to the future constitutional state of Kosovo, the need to involve Serbia in the region' s reconciliation process and - why not? - new discussions on relations between the European Union, NATO and the UN, in the light of the new balance that needs to be found between humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty, which I think calls for a change in the existing UN Charter. endTok	62.47917716537598
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, the war in Kosovo has knocked everything off balance. endTok	63.6447586151797
startTok This is certainly true for the relations between the European Union and the western Balkans. endTok	13.682902234262428
startTok Since then, expectations have been high. endTok	121.10027706343244
startTok This applies to them and us. endTok	56.59443203240247
startTok This is true on their part because - whether we like it or not - they are asking us for direct aid and they are wondering what Europe wants from them at the end of the day? endTok	70.85813090755732
startTok Is there any prospect of membership? endTok	38.357762549798856
startTok This is very much on their minds. endTok	41.6766446375147
startTok But here too, within the European Union, expectations are high. endTok	80.79498077796109
startTok If we do things properly, this may well be a first taster of a genuine common foreign and security policy. endTok	40.11957984210185
startTok Will the Union manage to display a united front and develop a common policy, for the first time, concerning such a difficult regulation? endTok	54.48482279623163
startTok It also remains to be seen whether the European Union has learnt any lessons from the bad experiences in Bosnia when it comes to providing aid and the slightly better experiences in Kosovo. endTok	49.69315015505053
startTok Can we, based on the experiences in Macedonia and in four other countries, improve on this? endTok	113.302209599277
startTok Against this background of extremely high expectations, I do not think that I am exaggerating if I say that this first step, namely the stability and association agreement with Macedonia, is vitally important. endTok	42.87979254157737
startTok This is not the Union' s only contribution. endTok	33.40442745931372
startTok The debate on the Stability Pact, the debate on the CARA programme and the financing arrangements in the short term are all pending. endTok	34.50586641726908
startTok We are now dealing with the stabilisation and association agreements, that is to say a medium-term issue. endTok	21.875571128163482
startTok This is why I think that this first agreement with Macedonia is so crucial, because it serves as a model. endTok	31.457411793206067
startTok I am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen. endTok	30.03441793083794
startTok What does the European Union intend to do with Macedonia? endTok	29.259449557894303
startTok Will it do the same to us? endTok	69.39694814522113
startTok This first step is so important because of this model function. endTok	71.1450278826725
startTok Macedonia also serves as a model for another reason. endTok	105.17502005512088
startTok The rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms, namely, the issue of interethnic relations. endTok	47.66135778434845
startTok There is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture. endTok	22.66041962776769
startTok During the presidential elections, it appeared that things were not running too smoothly, but compared to the rest of the region, Macedonia could serve as a model. endTok	79.0501434546924
startTok We would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western Balkans with the help of the Macedonians. endTok	43.65007772241238
startTok This model function also applies to regional cooperation. endTok	80.53930353328526
startTok I could not agree more with the rapporteur: a balance must be struck between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand and maintaining the openness towards Bulgaria and Greece, and not cutting them off on the other. endTok	72.71017841606641
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, if we manage this first step successfully, we will have gained a great deal. endTok	44.551056393188354
startTok If we mess it up, then we will have lost a great deal more. endTok	46.74770606066839
startTok Mr President, let me begin by saying that I have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle. endTok	24.754705888099053
startTok I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support. endTok	46.70246600187685
startTok I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia. endTok	21.49340539811377
startTok Do not misunderstand me: I too believe that we need to take effective action against the Milosevic regime. endTok	45.61358954575495
startTok But firstly, these sanctions have a far-reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbouring states too, including Macedonia, which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it is. endTok	96.47072711754141
startTok Secondly, the entire population of Yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of Milosevic and his circle, which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive. endTok	79.79290458848169
startTok So I believe that we should take today' s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions, as stated in Amendment No 10. endTok	38.53850301067023
startTok Mr President, we did not need to witness the end the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after various wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their untold negative effects on the stability of the Balkans, a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed, aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south-east Europe. endTok	57.9625048453991
startTok This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region. endTok	74.99374777108945
startTok The European Union' s contribution under the Stability Pact, now converted into what is called the "stabilisation and association process" , represents a development in the regional concept the European Community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. Its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, and it should therefore contribute to regional stability. endTok	50.547924991089936
startTok So establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on a completely new basis, and offering that country the prospect of full integration into the structures of the European Union through the mechanism of the stabilisation and association process, constitutes an important contribution to stability in the Balkans. endTok	38.708326625869645
startTok The assumption is that the countries are prepared to accept a certain set of conditions. endTok	41.4666016926216
startTok The expectation is that we send them a politically relevant signal that it is possible for them to join us one day, maintaining respect for their sovereignty of course. endTok	74.95903303711604
startTok We are not deluding ourselves by believing that, once agreement is obtained, the mandate we are giving the Commission today could constitute a first major step towards peace and stability in that long-suffering region, where the people have already shown they have the right to seek membership of our area of freedom and development. endTok	92.60663984382685
startTok They have suffered enough, first under the Soviet yoke and then from the high price they paid for being forced to become part of the communist bloc. endTok	87.34525033252201
startTok The evidence is that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is politically and economically capable of establishing new contractual relations with the European Union, going beyond the cooperation agreement in force since 1 June 1998, which in practice targets respect for the acquis communautaire, especially in key areas of the internal market. endTok	52.73719868752266
startTok It is true that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia still has a long way to go, but, given the political and economic reforms already made in the context of the cooperation agreement, and with transitional periods accepted for certain domains, the country will be able to fulfil the conditions for a stabilisation and association agreement. endTok	37.17752962517358
startTok We share the view that its development is a factor for stability in the region, we approve the terms of the negotiating mandate as proposed, emphasising that what is involved is a bilateral agreement with the European Union, and we agree with the rapporteur when he stresses that this is the first concrete application of an integrated long term strategy for south-east Europe, and that the issue is how the Balkans can be structured in the long term in order to guarantee peace and stability. endTok	45.946117393902554
startTok The various references made to regional cooperation with the neighbouring countries in fact become politically relevant in this context. endTok	81.76272607901652
startTok This agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region. endTok	45.38886667768883
startTok That is why it is so important. endTok	12.914344135773566
startTok The point is that underlying this whole process is an effective political will on the part of the European Union to draw closer to these countries. endTok	39.41891725098759
startTok We are aware that some of them are already undergoing processes of democratic stabilisation, that others still need to affirm the democratic authority of their governments, and that equilibrium in others depends on the military presence in the zone, but they are all countries which now know that, once they have overcome their difficulties, a bridge is available to provide an effective link with the European Union. endTok	60.04044310137163
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to join in the unanimous chorus from my fellow Members. endTok	23.18438218706676
startTok I think this report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy. endTok	27.22502951908302
startTok Paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example. endTok	235.5080892553097
startTok We know there are 13 applicant countries, from Lithuania to Turkey, and just one black hole in Europe, the Balkans, but because these countries are denied the opportunity to become applicants, we want to make them believe that this agreement is a miracle. endTok	65.29721304219996
startTok Paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status. endTok	240.0987966472182
startTok But this is not just a masterpiece of hypocrisy, it is also an aberration, because, if negotiations begin tomorrow, this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years. endTok	48.54827113983905
startTok And I defy you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia, amongst the Balkan countries, three years hence. endTok	186.48390168164426
startTok A few days ago Mr Racan announced that Croatia' s formal membership application would be presented at the end of 2000. endTok	80.09917026649848
startTok There are bound to be other applications and this great work, this fine intellectual architecture, will crumble, left behind by events just as we have been left behind by everything that has been happening in the former Yugoslavia for the past 20 years. endTok	78.19462838298311
startTok This would not be so serious if this region of Europe were not so beset by the problems we are all aware of, problems which are being addressed, but which have not yet been resolved, by the new government of Macedonia. There are the problems of coexistence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority, the connected problems of Kosovo, the notorious economic problems, the problems of being neighbour to a particularly developed mafia in Serbia, and then there is the problem of the Greek veto which must be condemned for what it is. endTok	59.116790088481864
startTok After nearly 10 years, Greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name, and I hope the interpreters have not used the term FYROM when I have been saying Macedonia. endTok	140.97722956036569
startTok It is absolutely absurd. Apart from anything else it is offensive, in my opinion, to the Greek MEPs and the citizens of Greece. endTok	53.380912156433425
startTok This question needs to be resolved urgently. endTok	40.71171093546301
startTok Finally, by happy chance, a letter from Mr Georgievski, President of Macedonia to Mr Fischler, dated 8 March, has come into my hands. In it, referring to Article O, now Article 49 of the Treaty, he asks if Macedonia can join the European Union. endTok	122.12814680027452
startTok Why has the Council not informed us of this? endTok	59.189732018156384
startTok Why has the Commission not informed us of this formal request from Macedonia? endTok	75.99122739897844
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, the Balkans are not purely a dark cave, politically speaking. endTok	51.08288485486936
startTok The decidedly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves. endTok	102.68202696449305
startTok The gruesome escalation of ethnic violence in neighbouring Kosovo did not reach its territory. endTok	76.98794957053481
startTok Paradoxically, but truly, the war in Kosovo Polje generated exactly the opposite effect: the perilous gap of confidence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority became decidedly smaller. endTok	98.24443525650109
startTok From the point of view of the Macedonian majority, the Albanian minority behaved loyally towards the common state during the international explosion of the Kosovo conflict. endTok	47.91745747206798
startTok In the eyes of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of Kosovo' s Albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme. endTok	71.2092082192026
startTok This remarkable upshot of the Kosovar war negotiations can therefore justifiably be seen as the internal, political establishment of the Republic of Macedonia the second time round. endTok	80.19318327664311
startTok Mr Swoboda' s well-balanced and laudable report fits in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level. endTok	43.015178814338036
startTok In brief, the European Union knows what to do in Macedonia: to help this local port of refuge - recently used by scores of war refugees - to fulfil its role properly as a catalyst for the planned Stability Pact in the Balkans. endTok	86.62433262766199
startTok Mr President, as one who has been concerned with Macedonia for eight years, I have to contradict Mr Dupuis. endTok	31.72796223248695
startTok What we are doing here is not hypocritical. endTok	28.325005276828144
startTok We have reached a propitious moment and I think the Macedonians are glad about it. endTok	35.23462844697668
startTok Please stop being so unpleasant and pouring cold water on everything. endTok	204.05808312708578
startTok I think we should take a more positive approach here. endTok	27.503130150609664
startTok Macedonia did not go through a war. endTok	98.55279400499835
startTok But it suffered from the war in its vicinity and from the sanctions, as it is still suffering from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on the neighbouring countries. endTok	46.981060778262034
startTok It suffered enormously from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo war. endTok	50.13015802933303
startTok So we must admit that developments in Macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines. endTok	89.87602365586311
startTok This is a country that has difficult inter-ethnic problems to deal with at home, and is resolving them with increasing success. endTok	76.5937712766758
startTok Let me emphasise that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation on ethnic minorities and the way it applies it and that the consistent policy of integrating the 30% of ethnic Albanians in government activity, in government policy and in society, is a precondition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia. endTok	88.54711762915635
startTok I am glad to see that the hope Mr Swoboda expressed in his report will be fulfilled early in March, i.e. that we will finally have an EU delegation there and that we, as the European Union, will finally have a greater role to play there. endTok	50.1534578144419
startTok I believe that the opening of these negotiations on the stability and association process is the logical conclusion of a salutary and positive trend in that country. endTok	29.03588326918821
startTok As a sign of our political commitment, we must finally show Macedonia in practice that we are indeed rewarding its own welcome regional cooperation by genuinely embarking on regional projects. endTok	115.88107274502244
startTok Let me name just two small ones: the rapid resolution of the problem of the frontier crossing with Kosovo in Blace and the creation of Corridor 8, from Albania via Macedonia to Bulgaria. endTok	95.13318188377761
startTok I think Mr Swoboda has drafted an excellent report, and it has my wholehearted support. endTok	31.521760287743525
startTok Mr President, I too would like to compliment Mr Swoboda on his report. endTok	7.219113307873246
startTok I think it is a good thing that so many of us are expressing support for the approach he has adopted in it. endTok	32.074993438447336
startTok The report tackles stability in the region in a structural manner. This is also the purpose of the pending agreement with the Republic of Macedonia which we are debating today. endTok	31.84303029817827
startTok Although the actual implementation of the Stability Pact has not yet started, the Commission has already developed the new instrument, entitled the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. endTok	58.87556222054724
startTok This marks the beginning of the treaty-based stabilising process for the countries of the former Yugoslavia. endTok	22.958849704775638
startTok These countries do not yet qualify for a pre-accession agreement. endTok	52.753483920172904
startTok The present agreement is a kind of pre-pre-agreement, but with a view to joining in future. endTok	69.92289474154555
startTok The instrument of joining countries together by means of active treaties is excellent, provided that the agreements stipulated in them are implemented dynamically, so that the required stabilisation can actually be attained. endTok	103.47720717795102
startTok Macedonia remains a potential minefield and has a history to match. endTok	129.26241198923194
startTok It does, however, have the ambition to break free from this image. endTok	107.61461248388231
startTok This requires internal stability. endTok	98.99793311798678
startTok The new government would like to tackle this matter and the agreement could be an agenda for reforms, including a direct role and equality for the Albanian minority. endTok	71.72385039179007
startTok More than anything, the country needs peace and quiet now, in order to put its internal house in order and to find the road to greater prosperity. endTok	95.30385445017271
startTok We, the social democrats, would urge the opposition to back these ideas. endTok	84.64710155198681
startTok They need to help support the much-praised Macedonian model. endTok	77.12036873769391
startTok But the country also - and especially - needs external stability. endTok	381.05403484554614
startTok What is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable? endTok	67.54124943328118
startTok This stability is required in the relations with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria. endTok	82.76364725081643
startTok The region should recognise that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist. endTok	52.31337244138509
startTok External stability also means open borders and regional cooperation. endTok	144.83987948546434
startTok Minorities and majorities need to be given room for human and cultural exchange. endTok	62.43518929238636
startTok Macedonia' s stability is very much linked with the developments in the neighbouring countries. endTok	43.77992073331459
startTok The Kosovo problem is well-known and the international community is present there on a massive scale. endTok	54.30221456916669
startTok It seems that the Albania factor is being underestimated. endTok	34.18331995269953
startTok The Union considers it untimely to reach a stability and association agreement with this country. endTok	37.14824625937699
startTok But what then instead? endTok	234.98244358928284
startTok It is the very argument to conclude an agreement with Macedonia and not yet with Albania that cause us so much concern, so much so that a passive stance from the Union vis-à-vis Albania is really not acceptable. endTok	89.7306872558826
startTok What does the Commission intend to do regarding this issue? endTok	25.97279902318926
startTok Yugoslavia is just as much a weak link in the stability process and, as such, a threat to Macedonia' s stability. endTok	83.3813150359014
startTok We need to wait and see what happens there. endTok	53.40969566359386
startTok The mood in Belgrade is becoming less predictable by the day. endTok	34.845377427742264
startTok We, however, second the Council' s decision to give the sanctions a different focus. endTok	175.78110880442102
startTok In this way, at least a serious attempt is being made to give the opposition, which is preparing for a new round of demonstrations, a shot in the arm. endTok	39.979702856611624
startTok What else will the Union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bringing forward elections - is met? endTok	99.18154528169848
startTok What else can we do to support this opposition? endTok	56.8504077895237
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, Kosovo was hopefully the last occasion on which international law could be interpreted as saying that dictators could persecute minorities in the most repellent way on the grounds that "it is happening within their own nation" . endTok	63.62864576847935
startTok When the USA and NATO and, finally, also the EU, reacted, it was already late, in fact very late. endTok	79.1084776564489
startTok A great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the EU, among others, has acted earlier and more decisively. endTok	85.31331575805679
startTok We, the European Union, therefore have a special responsibility to help, support and rebuild the Balkans now. endTok	76.11993585443379
startTok Our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south-east Europe to be integrated with other countries in the EU - economically, politically and in terms of trade. endTok	53.67365662993072
startTok Fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is best provided through trade and economic integration. endTok	95.11444879451747
startTok We Liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly, just as Paolo Costa reported. endTok	67.97889390549581
startTok It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia, and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report. endTok	25.59885823954217
startTok Macedonia deserves our support, especially in view of the self-sacrificial, disinterested work which the people and leaders of Macedonia undertook during the Kosovo war. endTok	142.41671895995492
startTok Now that Macedonia is prising itself loose from the crushing embrace of Communism and nationalism, it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms. endTok	48.61350425560823
startTok We should do exactly the same for the other countries in the Balkans. endTok	23.28997774905373
startTok This is an urgent duty for the EU. endTok	36.35005353719402
startTok Mr President, allow me in this context to remind MEPs - especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening - of the fact that the man who is mainly responsible for war, human degradation, murder and driving innocent people from their homes is still governing what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia. endTok	82.15039830354578
startTok The man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the Hague still goes free. endTok	68.9193416428548
startTok I am talking about Milosevic. endTok	26.703096932069013
startTok As long as Milosevic is still there and Serbia is not pursuing a democratic path, Serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkans, including in Macedonia. endTok	93.4219253337864
startTok Mr President, the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the Stability Pact in south-eastern Europe, endTok	42.53462827948992
startTok Its terms, which the Swoboda report accepts, are certainly not directed towards peace, but towards greater political and economic dominance of the country, and towards controlling its natural wealth, overexploiting its workforce and continuing to use that country as a springboard against the countries and peoples in the area who are resisting the new order. endTok	108.04250138906738
startTok All this, in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union. endTok	58.58297392761902
startTok The report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the European Union on south-eastern Europe. endTok	28.119021955755237
startTok It is characteristic that the report congratulates FYROM on the constructive stance it maintained during the NATO attack, eulogises its pacifist role because it allowed its territory to be used as a base for NATO forces, but, of course, remains silent about the indignation of its people, which was manifested by mass demonstrations during the NATO bombardments. endTok	80.6361785670083
startTok Finally, because we consider that both the stability pact and the stabilisation and association process the European Union is implementing in countries in that area, will create new problems there, new tribulations for their peoples, and will reinforce the dominant role of the American and European imperialists, we will be voting against the report in an expression of our solidarity with the people of FYROM. endTok	57.315336966295774
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, one of the most basic aims of the European Union' s stability and association agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to establish stability and peace in the area, and this, of course, presupposes developing and maintaining good neighbourly relations between the countries involved. endTok	32.37241283471756
startTok I shall not bother you with details of the problem concerning the name FYROM, which as you must know, is the subject of a difference of opinion with Greece and of negotiations between the two countries lasting over four years, under the aegis of the Secretary General of the UN in the context of related Security Council resolutions, but also the conventional obligation of the respective parties pursuant to Article 5 of the so-termed Intermediate Agreement of 1995. endTok	80.7315917806965
startTok I do, however, think it appropriate to say that, at the forthcoming negotiations and with the conclusion of the association agreement, the European side must point out to the Skopje government the need for it to show appropriate constructive political will, so that it may contribute positively to a successful outcome of the talks in New York. endTok	59.94907003187867
startTok I should like to hope that such an appeal from Europe, with parallel emphasis on the difficulties that any further indecision would create for completing and implementing the association agreement, would be duly heeded and appraised accordingly by the Skopje government, so that it can respond appropriately, on the one hand, to Greece' s demonstrably conciliatory attitude concerning the specific issue, and, on the other hand, to the more general practical, declared intention and disposition of all the partners in the European Union, including Greece, to facilitate and support FYROM' s progress towards a United Europe. endTok	59.95204304379133
startTok Mr President, this is because I do not think that the harmonious day to day relations, contacts and communication between FYROM and Greece that have actually been achieved at both bipartite and multipartite level, and this mainly thanks to the practical arrangements of the intermediate agreement, I repeat, I do not think these sufficiently cover the conditions and criteria of good neighbourliness necessary, inter alia, for negotiating and concluding an association agreement. endTok	91.83029771379626
startTok On the contrary, I think that this demand can only be considered satisfied by a de jure full normalisation of FYROM' s relations with all its neighbours. endTok	46.885746134107116
startTok That, combined with the essential improvement of certain aspects of the internal situation in that country, in the area of minorities and democratic institutions, would round off the image of political maturity which FYROM has, in fact, presented in other respects and which has made our European family welcome closer relations with it. endTok	100.0131679675545
startTok Mr President, the agreement we are debating today, as analysed by Mr Swoboda, which I hope we will adopt tomorrow, constitutes the second politically positive step, after the stability pact for the area. endTok	67.31313269957944
startTok There is another small step, which is related to the recent partial lifting of the embargo decided by our 15 governments for Yugoslavia. endTok	78.87167544119114
startTok For about 10 years, the situation in the area has been fluid. endTok	39.37815953699123
startTok Both as an historical period and, in particular, as a political period, 10 years is a very long time. endTok	68.62054083169119
startTok Under those conditions, then, there has been a real failure. endTok	94.57982610467847
startTok In that sense, the agreement we will be voting on tomorrow, which contributes towards stability in the area, is de facto a move in the right direction. endTok	60.00054681970282
startTok In essence, FYROM is a miniature version of the former Yugoslavia, regardless of where one or another minority holds supremacy. endTok	81.39485131488581
startTok From that standpoint, the fact that so far it has resisted any influences from its wider environment is a very positive element and under no circumstances should any of us, any State, any policy or any view, impel that small republic towards external, disruptive movements in an effort to solve other problems, granted - let it be noted - that it has institutions which it can build upon still further and so become a real democracy. endTok	182.01995873656116
startTok In that area, there have been various policies from time to time, and what the European Union should guard against is the risk that, for ultimately superficial reasons, it may help to create banana republics elsewhere. endTok	82.403684741808
startTok We must be sure that, in seeking allies in the area, we must not always choose anyone who offers. endTok	55.12130303133867
startTok We must choose those which are moderate, which have breadth of vision and which have a perception of peace and stability in the area. endTok	51.051302013914935
startTok I hope and wish, and am indeed certain, that the European Union, with maturity and with the measures it has begun to adopt, will little by little construct, in the wider area, the necessary environment which it needs itself. endTok	87.26577768831817
startTok Let us not deceive ourselves: a Europe, one part of which is being held back because of frictions, misinterpretations and conflicts, and because of nationalistic clashes, will never be a Europe that has brought its own house to the level it wants. endTok	57.07081851749012
startTok In any event, speaking now as a Greek, I want to tell some of the speakers I listened to earlier that much of what was said is fixated on other times and places. endTok	76.48913207657036
startTok They have quite failed to grasp the new conditions created in the area; the new and positive conditions which have been created, in very many cases on Greece' s initiative. endTok	61.17689167778037
startTok You should know that the country which cooperates most with FYROM and has the best relations with it, in the entire area, is Greece, and this has contributed greatly to the stability of the area. endTok	76.30935012426238
startTok I say this just so that we know where we stand. endTok	66.65370102503202
startTok . This has been a very interesting general debate about the Balkans as a whole. endTok	28.014318367577253
startTok It was none the worse for that, but perhaps I will be forgiven for concentrating very largely on the report because there are some extremely important issues that I want to touch on. endTok	45.731672005263775
startTok I am delighted to be able to be able to set out the Commission's position on the report. endTok	10.976385923993522
startTok It is very helpful. endTok	12.970538065592898
startTok It is an excellent contribution by Mr Swoboda and his colleagues. endTok	24.1027417980077
startTok We are very grateful for his leadership on this issue and for that of some of his colleagues, a number of whom are in the House this evening - Mrs Pack, Mr Lagendijk and others. endTok	35.97376410533069
startTok I am very pleased that at our overall relations with FYROM are in such a good state. endTok	49.94568510965994
startTok Perhaps Mr Dupuis will forgive me for using that expression - both he and his interpreter - in the spirit of entente cordiale. endTok	60.20557577494971
startTok That has been helped by our excellent European Union representative in the country. endTok	66.71974693605134
startTok He has been a great friend to Parliament and a great servant of the Commission. endTok	29.444610860422493
startTok The imminent commencement of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement is the most powerful example of our good relations. endTok	44.01690626483487
startTok So to is the cooperation of FYROM in the rebuilding of Kosovo. endTok	89.80696596118925
startTok I am grateful to the authorities in Macedonia for their assistance in recent weeks in helping to cope with the considerable difficulties with the power supply in Kosovo. endTok	48.77386584687787
startTok Like honourable Members I recognise the stabilising role that this country has played during the Balkan tragedy, in particular when it comes to integrating the Albanian minority into the political and social life of the country. endTok	53.18244806657462
startTok I saw the newly-elected President Georgievski a few weeks ago and I was extremely impressed, as others have been, by his commitment to multi-ethnicity and pluralism. endTok	38.97739984475073
startTok Let me set out where matters now stand on these negotiations to which - as Mr Lagendijk said - other countries in the region are looking with very considerable interest. endTok	88.2715805969929
startTok The Council adopted on 24 January this year its negotiating directives for a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. endTok	39.65011170126235
startTok This represents the most important step forward in the stabilisation and association process of the western Balkans region initiated by the Commission in May 1999. endTok	27.807213023052547
startTok Let me make clear the main elements of those draft directives. endTok	75.96213590984313
startTok They cover the inclusion in the agreement of arrangements establishing a political dialogue with FYROM. endTok	131.861421938153
startTok They cover provisions for enhanced regional cooperation including the prospect of establishing free trade areas between the countries of the region, though I must make it clear that there is no question of any attempt to recreate the state of Yugoslavia. endTok	46.51146268193934
startTok They cover the prospect of the establishment of a free trade area between the European Union and them within ten years of the entry into force of the agreement. endTok	37.55831474266775
startTok They cover provisions on the movement of workers, freedom of establishment, supply of services, current payments and movement of capital. endTok	131.8972663717971
startTok They cover a commitment by FYROM to approximate its legislation to that of the European Community, notably in key areas of the internal market; and they cover provisions on cooperation with FYROM in a wide range of fields, including justice and home affairs. endTok	59.86679901656167
startTok We are now making in the Commission the necessary preparations so that negotiations can start in March. endTok	45.4543084306254
startTok I am due to visit FYROM in the second week in March. endTok	69.83126478729486
startTok I hope to be able to set the process in motion then, although the formal negotiations will start very shortly thereafter. endTok	102.37573397360609
startTok At the time of that visit I will also, as recommended by honourable Members and others, be upgrading our representation in FYROM. endTok	57.23853627581321
startTok The target date for concluding the negotiations is December this year but this will depend to a very large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiators. endTok	49.95815432020595
startTok The agreement could enter into force in three to four years from now, given the time needed for ratification in Member States' parliaments. endTok	74.21854031940285
startTok I should like to comment very briefly on a number of other points in the draft resolution. endTok	14.228733754510232
startTok We accept that the agreement should to a certain extent serve as an example for other such agreements, although obviously we will also want to take account of the fact that we are dealing with different countries, each of which has its own identity and its own concerns. endTok	50.52446604035526
startTok I share the wide-spread concern that we should treat each country on its merits and not shackle everyone to the pace of the slowest in the development of relations with the Union. endTok	47.25568380710412
startTok That has never been the intention. endTok	37.486996469019104
startTok The very fact that negotiations are beginning first with FYROM, before all the others, is evidence that we can and do differentiate. endTok	108.83647383055416
startTok On the provision of regional aid referred to in the report we agree that our technical and financial assistance should go in part to projects having a cross-border or regional dimension. endTok	107.06561672226533
startTok We agree that there should be an evolutionary clause on the prospect of EU membership contained in the stabilisation and association agreement. endTok	29.048284461713283
startTok It will reflect the European Union's position on its relations with the countries of the western Balkans as set out in the Cologne European Council conclusions. endTok	30.150042784875847
startTok We strongly agree on the need to decentralise our assistance programmes to the maximum possible extent. endTok	40.90139770039844
startTok As for the arrangements covering European Union assistance to the western Balkans, Members will be aware that we are drawing up a new regulation to simplify and streamline their management and to put everything under one regulation. endTok	62.31110639949491
startTok I am aware that there is concern in FYROM and elsewhere at the end of the PHARE programme in these countries and, especially, at the loss of association with the PHARE name. endTok	61.71300567342163
startTok I note with considerable concern what Members say on this score. endTok	189.63812756139052
startTok I will take another look at the issue, although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion. endTok	151.3535530937776
startTok I want to stress, however, that whatever the programme is called, our commitment to the integration of FYROM and its neighbours into the European family is stronger than ever. endTok	54.978713711018536
startTok In general I trust that Members of this House will share my pleasure that Macedonia has reached this stage relatively rapidly. endTok	76.37276284434617
startTok I hope that the other countries of the region will redouble their efforts to make similar progress. endTok	29.295572619232452
startTok I look forward to many similar debates to this over the next few years marking, I hope, the success of what we are trying to do in the Balkans which, for me, remains the single most important litmus-test of what Europe is able to do on its own doorstep. endTok	50.63603837838536
startTok Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten. endTok	4.905951086083287
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m. endTok	2.8274194969118276
startTok Agreement on comitology endTok	340.0737812198914
startTok The next item is the report (A5-0021/2000) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the implementation of the new Council decision of 28 June 1999 on comitology (1999/468/EC). endTok	8.389368792601138
startTok . (IT) Mr President, the approval of this agreement with the Commission on procedures for implementing the Council decision on comitology marks the end of a saga which has kept Parliament busy for two years, along with a few enthusiasts scattered among the various institutions of the Union, whom many people do not hesitate to call masochists. endTok	40.256366052141715
startTok Until 1993, the way the Commission exercised its executive powers, and in particular the mysterious and even suspect committee arrangements, was creating conflict and mistrust between the institutions, and threatening to have serious consequences on the legislative procedure. endTok	92.06231694759347
startTok That is why, in accordance with Declaration No 31, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union institutions have undertaken a complex task of negotiation and consultation, resulting in the new Council decision, which revises the old system quite substantially, although we are not entirely satisfied with it. endTok	62.07220366053024
startTok In particular, the decision outlines a form of parliamentary control whereby Parliament can sound the alarm if an implementing measure, deriving from an act adopted under the codecision procedure, oversteps the implementing powers delegated to the Commission. endTok	78.87077283166201
startTok During the protracted interinstitutional negotiations - which saw Parliament actively involved, thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Adelaide Aglietta - it was understood that the European Parliament and Commission would conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the procedures for implementing certain aspects of the new decision. On the one hand, certain points which the Council did not intend to incorporate into the decision were to be made explicit and, on the other, the system for providing information about implementing measures and monitoring them was to be organised more precisely. endTok	71.17044194082487
startTok During the trialogue held on 6 October 1999 in Strasbourg, the Presidents of the European Parliament and the Commission approved the idea of concluding this agreement soon. endTok	47.71949403710576
startTok We believe we have respected that commitment, and indeed this was made relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiations with the Commission. endTok	127.15259945196473
startTok Essentially, the agreement deals with two points: one is the right of the European Parliament to be informed, which is the sine qua non for the genuine exercise of its right to intervene pursuant to Article 8 of the decision. endTok	55.219850454476656
startTok Hitherto, such information had been supplied on paper and unsystematically, and was of no use to our services; and indeed this was often the fault of Parliament itself. endTok	90.30199227361175
startTok From now on, the information will be provided by means of an electronic system called CIRCA, to which the European Parliament will have access. This represents a real innovation, not only for us, but also - I am sure - for the Commission. endTok	52.03093748732487
startTok The other point is that Article 8 of the Council decision does not specify either the method by which the European Parliament is to sound the alarm, or the time limit within which it must exercise its restricted power of control. endTok	61.929733045609126
startTok Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the agreement confirm that, as a general rule, the European Parliament will adopt its resolution, stating its reasons, at a plenary sitting and has one month to exercise its right of intervention before the Commission adopts the draft implementing measure. endTok	108.21491727852121
startTok But we all realise that it is not always possible to wait a month before implementing a measure. endTok	57.08940835605819
startTok Therefore, the agreement contains explicit provisions on urgent procedure, including possible action by the committee responsible. endTok	182.12665967698464
startTok I want to end by stressing that we cannot assess whether this is a good agreement or not, we must wait and see how it works in practice. endTok	54.12026997451584
startTok The European Parliament needs to acquire the resources, which it currently lacks, to ensure efficient monitoring of implementing measures, and the Commission must accept that some of its practices need reorganising to provide proper information to Parliament and ensure that control can be effective. endTok	69.85944069806288
startTok Finally, it needs to be borne in mind that - whatever happens - the real solution to the problems of comitology for the European Parliament is still to change the procedure for implementing legislation laid down in the Treaties, and gradually to dismantle the committees whose existence represents an anomaly that severely restricts the Commission' s executive power and may prejudice the European Parliament' s legislative powers. endTok	59.791197999110686
startTok Mr President, comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means. endTok	85.98272338437495
startTok It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies, which is the way things used to be. endTok	93.87459187828672
startTok In fact, it implies nothing other than fixing the procedures for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission. endTok	42.02875251135638
startTok The procedures for exercising these implementing powers take the form of a limited number of committee procedures. endTok	74.25305374561276
startTok Up until the Amsterdam Treaty, there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures, which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens. endTok	274.23686786620647
startTok On the contrary, for a long time even the European Parliament was not informed. endTok	24.71669093244261
startTok For the European Parliament, the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed, at least, of all that the European Commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees. endTok	50.34986093722792
startTok Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors. endTok	79.78232788384551
startTok A further step towards transparency and the involvement of the European Parliament came with what is known as the modus vivendi of 20 September 1994, which granted Parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases. endTok	65.67580085985799
startTok It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny. endTok	64.53130774524166
startTok With the Amsterdam Treaty, the situation improved decidedly when the number of committee procedures was drastically reduced - as the European Parliament had long wanted - to three procedures, the administrative procedure, the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure. endTok	112.52420714364429
startTok Now, following the Amsterdam Treaty, the rights of information and control granted to the European Parliament in the past need to be enshrined anew in an interinstitutional agreement. endTok	46.63722865371896
startTok Mrs Frassoni, our rapporteur, has done very careful work and identified the questions that have to be clarified in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedures that may have to be changed within Parliament. endTok	60.890139871172835
startTok A key problem is the time factor. endTok	51.18446204791307
startTok When the European Parliament is informed, it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks, should it so wish. endTok	64.87547193167497
startTok In matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the European Union, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative, must be in a position to react very rapidly, if necessary within a few hours or days. endTok	35.01965219570098
startTok Nevertheless, the European Parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react. endTok	83.21576280319042
startTok Our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties, which I and my group can only support in full. endTok	101.39219779164104
startTok I just have one more request. endTok	138.49131145526718
startTok In the German version, paragraph 2 of the resolution has been translated rather misleadingly and I urgently ask for clarification, which I would also like to see in the printed version later. endTok	37.9815025438953
startTok In my view, instead of "weitergeführt werden müssen" the wording should be "erhalten bleiben müssen" . endTok	25.75887677614561
startTok The German version is not very clear here. endTok	39.29264831230714
startTok I would ask for that to be checked again. endTok	24.058115295607436
startTok For the rest, I warmly thank our rapporteur. endTok	55.82748930415254
startTok It is a difficult subject and I hope we have managed to make it somewhat easier to deal with now. endTok	30.80159666227994
startTok Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report. endTok	7.689915841966205
startTok I must add that it is a welcome change to see Mrs Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and willing to reach compromises with the other institutions. endTok	42.29509434259303
startTok When it comes to the IGC, she is one of what the French call "les pures et dures" : no compromise, no deals with the other institutions; we would rather see the whole thing blocked than compromise our positions. endTok	79.38868033181795
startTok Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved, which are far from matching Parliament' s original position on the issue of comitology. endTok	54.48920066749317
startTok Let us remember what is at stake here. endTok	23.948774383720156
startTok Parliament had four main criticisms of the comitology system as it existed prior to the new Council decision supplemented by this interinstitutional agreement. endTok	52.11625549838178
startTok Firstly, the whole system is obscure. endTok	29.351131923180127
startTok It is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees. endTok	78.31612623212821
startTok Here is a real step forward, in the new system that has been agreed. endTok	25.684201463658436
startTok We are to know who is on each committee. endTok	83.10279018971222
startTok We are to know when they meet. endTok	57.16295603911994
startTok We are to get the agendas. endTok	41.999282726913556
startTok We are to get the documents that are sent to them. endTok	38.575991099541305
startTok The whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex. endTok	67.78048092084896
startTok So that is at least a step forward. endTok	24.166826072959154
startTok Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission. endTok	23.202342744414103
startTok We adopt legislation in the European Union. endTok	33.51241349103931
startTok We expect the Commission to implement it. endTok	25.239975804512806
startTok And then we have a system designed to hinder the Commission and make it more difficult - especially what was called the "contre-filet" system, under which the Council could block the Commission by a simple majority even when the Council was not capable of finding an alternative to the implementing measure concerned. endTok	49.03804783504975
startTok Here too there is at least some progress. endTok	74.74537899534735
startTok The Council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period unless it has a qualified majority to block it, in other words, unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States represented in the Council. endTok	35.641617453945926
startTok That is a more reasonable system. endTok	30.234364580352278
startTok That, too, is a step forward. endTok	30.04308370428621
startTok But on our other two criticisms, we are less satisfied. endTok	55.08604134045979
startTok The first criticism is of the system whereby the Commission is monitored, scrutinised, controlled if you like, only by a committee appointed by Member States or the Council not by Parliament. endTok	64.87760648425149
startTok The legislative authority, Council and Parliament, should be equal. endTok	64.51918513942982
startTok We confer implementing powers on the Commission, but then it is only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implementing measure. endTok	82.8498042195312
startTok Parliament has no equivalent power. endTok	55.831668898151825
startTok True, we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system. endTok	44.33366107421277
startTok We are to receive all the draft implementing measures forwarded to a committee at the same time as it is sent to the committee. endTok	33.49277986880247
startTok We will have the chance to scrutinise, to debate, to question. endTok	41.646627390651325
startTok But we will only have the right to formally challenge the Commission if we think it has gone beyond the delegation that we have given to the Commission in the legislation. endTok	39.84231782246001
startTok In other words, we can challenge the measure for being ultra-vires but not on its content. endTok	47.131688473887486
startTok And in a democracy, Parliament should be able to challenge the content. endTok	49.01090749562
startTok Not that we do so every week. endTok	95.92102531075047
startTok We are not seeking to immerse ourselves in implementing decisions, but it is a democratic safeguard that we should be able to do so on those few occasions when it really would be necessary. endTok	28.871947668038015
startTok That is lacking in this new system, or at least is only there in embryonic form. endTok	58.1284080460654
startTok Finally, our fourth criticism is that if an implementing measure is blocked through the comitology system it is referred back, not to both branches of the legislative authority, but to the Council alone, which has the right possibly to take an alternative measure. endTok	65.90063133751462
startTok That is not correct. endTok	25.167788850152316
startTok Both branches adopt the legislation - Council and Parliament - that confers implementing powers on the Commission. endTok	177.0380884986127
startTok If such implementing measures are referred back, it should be to both branches, not to one branch alone. endTok	78.48802249597426
startTok Overall we have a system which has made some progress. endTok	64.50306621734902
startTok The supplementary aspects that arise from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome, but that could not change the basic decision of the Council. endTok	57.69013197153302
startTok Even here, we have renounced voluntarily - because this did not happen automatically - the Plumb-Delors agreement as part of the overall compromise. endTok	65.34664479356829
startTok We have been willing to relinquish the provisions in that. endTok	29.891465182026746
startTok We shall have to be very vigilant on what used to be covered by that agreement and is not fully covered by the new decision. endTok	47.711792284836534
startTok We must be very vigilant. endTok	18.530664826309692
startTok So it is a step forward. endTok	17.093061790713936
startTok My group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward. endTok	35.06122314463458
startTok We are not as enthusiastic about compromising as Mrs Frassoni. endTok	41.18335901769897
startTok We recognise that there are limitations and the issue will no doubt come back in a few years' time. endTok	26.809642450961483
startTok If we want a Union that is democratic and transparent to the fullest degree we will have to revisit this subject. endTok	41.636659536667
startTok Mr President, first I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, for her work. endTok	9.842207084701261
startTok It is never easy working on comitology. endTok	77.27309449863763
startTok Mrs Schleicher referred to a kind of committee magic, something we have long talked about. endTok	49.98937076364983
startTok Certainly the process has always been very complex, as a result of historical decisions, and these must eventually be rationalised. endTok	48.329964813622475
startTok In my opinion, the agreement reached between Commission and Parliament is a clear rationalisation of the process. endTok	39.355774365661475
startTok From our point of view, it satisfies the fundamental interests of Parliament. endTok	48.42147292535304
startTok Mr Corbett set out Parliament' s concerns. endTok	85.81536146863196
startTok He says some of them have been satisfied and others have not. endTok	57.361652829464326
startTok I would say the ones the Commission was able to satisfy have been satisfied. endTok	47.45826271377567
startTok Mr Corbett is raising issues the Council decision does not cover, and unfortunately we can go no further on those. endTok	119.8359534100795
startTok So how far have we come? endTok	232.84981542673006
startTok There is no doubt that we have reached a fundamental point, highlighted by Mrs Frassoni, given that we now have an automatic information system. endTok	30.98763538503563
startTok This will facilitate two activities Parliament is especially interested in. endTok	203.04873922373605
startTok One is knowing how the committees operate, about their composition, agendas, descriptions, and so on, and the other is the right of scrutiny over actual decisions. endTok	119.95624100361775
startTok I think this is a good agreement. endTok	15.552304277787222
startTok It is a good agreement which undoubtedly improves the transparency of the process. endTok	35.71577678276263
startTok From here on things are going to be easier. endTok	118.49456064601686
startTok But the agreement we are reaching today should not be regarded as a backward step compared with the Plumb/Delors Agreement. endTok	44.09520143346355
startTok Mr Corbett referred to that, but the new model is certainly much more complex, different because the situation is now different, and, in our opinion, much more coherent. endTok	79.04995498468828
startTok We have made a start, and we hope the work will produce some excellent results. endTok	55.036550156464514
startTok We think there are other positive advances too. endTok	83.88103041531923
startTok To a certain extent we have gone beyond agreements which are already dated and, by realigning old procedures with the new situation, we aim to clear up everything still outstanding from the past. endTok	81.28853686950119
startTok From the Commission' s point of view, our conclusion is that this is a good agreement, and we want to thank the Members of Parliament who worked on it - especially Mrs Frassoni. endTok	30.557918552208804
startTok We hope that this new climate means we have achieved the result we were seeking, which is greater transparency and better information about the decisions of the Commission as an executive. endTok	69.79418050766202
startTok Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira. endTok	5.802747644845111
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001

startTok Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure endTok	51.75165603669399
startTok The next item is the report (A5-0013/2000) by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(1999) 444 - C5-0174/1999 - 1999/0196(CNS)) endTok	6.198318937827945
startTok Mr President, I am also pleased to welcome the Spanish Commissioner, Mr Solbes Mira, whom I have congratulated more than once, inside and outside this Parliament, on the excellent work he did in Spain on the subject of European convergence. endTok	40.788648748818815
startTok The proposal for an amendment to this regulation on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure, annexed to the Treaty of Maastricht, raises fundamental issues concerning the switch to the 1995 European system of accounts, which, as you know, replaced the previous System of Accounts adopted in 1979, and in particular the emergence of new financial product categories, consistency in the calculation of the ratios of government deficit to gross domestic product on the basis of ESA 95 and, finally, recognising the importance of calculating interest expenditure and the consistency of the latter with this new methodology. endTok	44.71356819975303
startTok In our view, the main purpose of the proposal for a regulation is to update the definitions and the assessments of some of the economic operations involved in the calculation of deficits, as reflected in the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Treaty of Maastricht, which lays down the maximum percentages which the government deficit must not exceed as a ratio of GDP at market prices in the various Member States. endTok	36.076067725932255
startTok To date, the Member States have calculated this GDP in accordance with the criteria laid down in ESA 79. endTok	36.50362725637374
startTok The most recent estimate of the deficit was submitted in September 1999 and it relates to the 1998 financial year. endTok	60.09755750107987
startTok Therefore, if the regulation is adopted, the estimate which is due to appear in March 2000, the first estimate of the deficit for the 1999 accounting year, will be made using the new system. endTok	71.01149046679821
startTok We know the Member States have done their duty - if I can use that expression - doing their calculations and preparing their national accounts in line with ESA 95, and they have already published their corresponding estimates. endTok	94.41922914489888
startTok In addition to incorporating a new methodology, this has meant making slight changes to most accounting aggregates and operations, on account of the aforesaid methodological changes, and also the improved statistical information included in the estimates. endTok	70.36744828561865
startTok These changes may of course alter the government deficits in terms of the Member States' national accounting. endTok	58.44346760416589
startTok I will now describe, very briefly, the five areas where the most important changes may occur. endTok	69.98196806987708
startTok First, the adjustments to the scope of what is meant by 'government institutional sector' under ESA 95. endTok	127.41516023389673
startTok This is important, since government deficit means the deficit accumulated by all forms of government. endTok	150.40044533691477
startTok The non-availability of precise criteria for the definition of government deficit would produce distortions in the estimates of the Member States' government deficits. endTok	74.44325341947086
startTok Secondly, the deficit - or, if applicable, the surplus - means the ESA 95 government sector' s net borrowing requirement or lending ability respectively endTok	429.92715998299076
startTok Thirdly, government investment means the gross fixed capital formation of the general government sector, as defined in ESA 95. endTok	177.10479154920924
startTok Fourthly, government debt is defined in accordance with ESA 95, as are the flows or interest stemming from assets/liabilities. endTok	143.23970716075704
startTok Fifthly and finally, the aggregate to which government debt will relate will be gross domestic product at current market prices, estimated in accordance with the 1995 European System of Accounts' definitions. endTok	125.90941325825435
startTok To summarise, I consider that this proposal constitutes a satisfactory adaptation of the criteria laid down in the 1995 European System of Accounts, and I therefore approve it in full, as did the committee. endTok	56.5715792276858
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, let me say at the outset that my group welcomes this proposal because it makes the basic statistical data for an economic and monetary union directed at stability and real growth more harmonised, directly comparable and more accurate. endTok	51.134172453253456
startTok We have already heard about the various aspects involved. endTok	40.36890447084678
startTok What I think is crucial is that henceforth the statistical data will be more reliable and comparable. endTok	40.328837505301145
startTok We need that because the various European Union bodies and all the Member States within monetary union have to be able to depend on one another. endTok	49.502400812566975
startTok It is important to adjust the procedure for two reasons. endTok	19.974758555009874
startTok Firstly, for the single market. endTok	50.04512032274383
startTok It is most important quite generally in a single market to have reliable and directly comparable data and statistics so as to give an accurate picture of the situation and development trends. endTok	56.69217987012062
startTok Secondly, for economic and monetary union. endTok	26.901318303412094
startTok The regulation dating from 1993 on the application of the Protocol must be brought into harmony with the methodology of the European system of accounts at national and regional level. endTok	30.633965145294713
startTok That is vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficits. endTok	34.95236283479069
startTok This adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficits and debts in the Member States more precisely. endTok	41.476499168289514
startTok These technical changes will have a very real impact on the actual position of the countries, since the data will automatically be amended in line with the public deficit. endTok	37.61600872472791
startTok I also welcome the fact that the estimates of the deficits for the 1999 financial year that are due to be published in March 2000 are already based on the new ESA, i.e. the analysis is based on consolidated aggregates that are economically relevant. endTok	47.20617037951042
startTok Let me also briefly use this debate as an opportunity to urge all the governments and political parties to do their utmost to ensure that this procedure never has to be initiated for an excessive deficit. endTok	45.50969832237701
startTok It is good that the procedure exists. endTok	27.578898517413972
startTok We need it because it lends our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility. endTok	72.14279528546835
startTok The citizens ask what happens if the criteria are not met. endTok	71.38534757816016
startTok Thanks to these procedures and other measures we can prove that we are taking the criteria and ourselves seriously. endTok	66.24666501523238
startTok Another important point is that we must do all we can, not just to prevent excessive deficits, but also to further reduce public deficits. endTok	55.11220955712481
startTok I know what I am talking about and I will conclude by telling you why I am so glad we are holding this debate! endTok	34.33490160740166
startTok We are currently holding a debate in my own country on whether the former minister for finance actually gave us accurate information on the deficit. endTok	56.92774635809583
startTok In my country, Austria, new elections had to be held in 1995 in order to meet the Maastricht criteria and persuade our political partner to rethink his approach. endTok	83.07755194347996
startTok I must also tell you that in the year 2000, when there is so much talk about us, the coalition talks with the SPÖ failed - and unfortunately so - because the Socialist Party brought down the negotiated austerity and consolidation programme. endTok	56.59486381529984
startTok That is a prime reason why the new government had to be formed in Austria; for the Austrian People' s Party, the ÖVP, wants to continue to act as guarantor of economic stability. The ÖVP wants to ensure that we continue to meet the Maastricht criteria and reduce the public deficit, as we have agreed here. endTok	39.397730000937045
startTok Mr President, the beauty of statistical data is that it is not only reliable but also comparable. endTok	20.244112254531263
startTok This is of great importance, especially in the light of European unification and the completion of the internal market. endTok	17.866784808448138
startTok This is why this report is also so politically charged: a report, by the way, on which we would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly. endTok	42.133224936463115
startTok It also inspires a few political comments. endTok	31.549963062091464
startTok The Stability Pact is a given in Europe. endTok	41.11871322158349
startTok All countries participating in the euro have committed themselves, in the medium term, to striving towards a budget which is either balanced or shows up a slight surplus. endTok	82.45466370545027
startTok This, of course, does not mean that, if the economic climate is less than favourable, the budget could not fluctuate up or down slightly. It means that, in the long and medium term, there should be a balance or surplus. endTok	57.03297710830838
startTok The stronger the position of the participating countries, the stronger the euro will be. endTok	127.26293523797058
startTok As a result, the three percent standard will rarely be exceeded, not even in a bad economic climate. endTok	54.43702686836361
startTok This is the theory behind it, anyway. endTok	44.079466108138
startTok We have always been of the opinion that these criteria should be stringently met. endTok	30.584187050514394
startTok That is of great importance in order to turn the EMU into a success, now and in the future. endTok	39.72639768597589
startTok Strict compliance with the Stability Pact can thus contribute to a culture of stability within all EMU Member States. endTok	57.70031112493605
startTok Various Member States have taken one-off measures to be able to meet the criteria. endTok	53.44170545150738
startTok We are of the opinion that the Member States' budget policy should be strictly supervised, to ensure that the measures continue to be taken in the spirit of the prescribed criteria at all times. endTok	34.40428314002409
startTok A drop in standards should not be allowed. endTok	44.72207612430443
startTok We are also of the opinion that a further reduction in the burden and reducing the national debt should be prioritised. endTok	35.15659789106092
startTok Indeed, we still have not managed to stop passing on the burden to future generations. endTok	58.27847147707044
startTok . (ES) Mr President, many thanks, first of all, to the rapporteur for his splendid work. endTok	31.144398187654932
startTok It was a subject which called for a large dose of technical skill and I think Mr Knörr has handled it with great precision and professionalism. endTok	46.04341873993192
startTok I would not presume to be able to summarise the content of our proposal better than he has done; I would just like to add one small point: in addition to adaptation to ESA 95, there are two small technical changes which Mr Knörr knows all about, relating to interest and the valuation of debt in foreign currency. endTok	55.30841948422535
startTok I just mention that to complete the view of the process. endTok	58.78119680199772
startTok Secondly, I would like to thank Mr Knörr for his speediness. endTok	8.03790657112839
startTok He has done really good work in a very short time. endTok	44.623747496877996
startTok This is an important subject for certain references which we have heard subsequently. endTok	33.178271517095936
startTok What we are seeking with this legislation is not to make the statistics reliable and comparable - they already are - but to make them more reliable and more comparable. endTok	71.4405123639269
startTok Obviously, the fact that Parliament has taken its decision so quickly will mean that the March figures can already be calculated on the basis of these new criteria. endTok	72.28914508187778
startTok That being so, I believe the final result will be better. endTok	94.79944307864652
startTok The figures will be more reliable and more comparable and I think the concerns some Members have raised about compliance with the stability pact can be better addressed. endTok	47.29877578064465
startTok This regulation is purely instrumental. endTok	24.190201552150288
startTok It does deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raised. endTok	60.614905300749705
startTok But we do need to think about how we deal with the substance of the problem. endTok	29.88911346992565
startTok The stability pact is in place and we will continue to press ahead with monitoring compliance by the various Member States, despite the fact that the results are clearly positive in all the Member States where we have analysed the position as regards the stability of the government deficit. endTok	32.90795990795995
startTok But we see no reason to lower our guard. endTok	162.80390878444845
startTok We must press on in that direction because we know it is vital. endTok	39.9530224321006
startTok So, once again - and finally - I want to thank you for your help in allowing us to measure stability with greater technical certainty and better comparability. endTok	71.49009485130885
startTok Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira. endTok	5.802747644845111
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m. endTok	2.8274191598571785
startTok Increasing penal sanctions against counterfeiting of the euro endTok	61.513988403308566
startTok The next item is the report (A5-0020/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on a draft Framework Decision of the Council on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro (5116/1999 - C5-0332/1999 - 1999/0821(CNS)). endTok	8.416244181922686
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok (SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen (all the more welcome for being so few in number), one might have thought that it was an unimportant subject which was to be discussed at this hour, but that is not the case. endTok	40.51669206069214
startTok It is a definite and concrete issue. It is about our common currency. endTok	42.674662743908826
startTok How many people here know that this currency is being counterfeited and that we have a quite unacceptable state of affairs? endTok	49.994984642775776
startTok We cannot permit our common currency to become weaker through its being counterfeited. endTok	96.84802578304867
startTok The ECB, ECOFIN, Europol, OLAF and the Commissioner responsible for legal questions have therefore realised that common countermeasures must be taken quickly in order to close the loopholes left by the legislation. endTok	60.15931584821497
startTok It is easy to forget that it will be possible to exchange the old currencies for twenty years after the new currency has been introduced. endTok	31.63046930055439
startTok It is therefore important to include these currencies too in the section of the present programme of measures which deals with penal sanctions. endTok	49.29412844660146
startTok This is something which Parliament has said it wants to see added. endTok	48.65559548337968
startTok The Council ought to have given Parliament the stipulated three-month period within which to consider, too, the last document produced on this matter, but we are all aware of how urgent it is to have these measures put safely in place. endTok	82.64005699302199
startTok Because the issue is to be decided upon in March in the Council, Parliament has cause to adopt a position on the proposal now, so that the Member States have time also to take due account of Parliament' s points of view in the decision which has to be made in March. endTok	37.31362493019494
startTok Any country which began to make difficulties would incur a responsibility for the currency, and that country would be accountable, both morally and economically, if its actions were to contribute to a delay. endTok	86.94363445299527
startTok A country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself. endTok	100.76153938692337
startTok On 1 January 2002 the euro will be in circulation. endTok	30.506678394482513
startTok The whole of the Union must have the same protection, a type of protection which prohibits counterfeiting, not only of currencies in circulation but also of currencies which will be in circulation. endTok	57.306072817146834
startTok It is important that, in time, there should be a more or less similar-looking form of protection under criminal law in all countries. endTok	52.309805433740834
startTok The Commission has proposed measures aimed at providing information, together with penal sanctions, preventive measures and the pooling of experience. endTok	36.21987328708709
startTok These measures do, in fact, entail a certain necessary harmonisation in as much as the lowest acceptable maximum penalty for currency counterfeiting is to be eight years' imprisonment. endTok	101.10030935192931
startTok Trading with counterfeit currencies and the possession of counterfeiting equipment will also become criminal offences. endTok	114.27893015749565
startTok Quite simply, we are to have a minimum level for the maximum penalty. endTok	36.670009036676866
startTok The denominations of the euro are well known. endTok	16.3615299128002
startTok Modern computer equipment can be used to cause a very great deal of damage if we do not protect ourselves. endTok	44.5000372599459
startTok Parliament has tabled a number of amendments to the present proposal, for example in regard to jurisdiction, the idea being that a person may only be prosecuted and sentenced in the one country for the same crime. endTok	61.30099590200091
startTok There are also proposed sanctions against companies which are involved in counterfeiting, this being a measure which we would encourage. endTok	87.78316398426809
startTok The new applicant States are also encouraged to adapt to these regulations. endTok	37.071695929201525
startTok It has taken two years for the Council and the Commission to produce this proposal. endTok	16.83049396462273
startTok It is essential that the decision should now be taken in March. endTok	17.793501278398043
startTok To delay, or perhaps even risk damage to the euro, would be indefensible. endTok	126.1559914809462
startTok It would also be a betrayal of the people who will be handling the new, unfamiliar notes. endTok	21.02156209618915
startTok In particular, it is believed that counterfeiters will turn their attention to countries outside the euro zone, where people are less familiar with the new currency. endTok	76.7428193865034
startTok The protective measures cover these countries too, and the views expressed by these countries have carried a lot of weight. endTok	74.43998773863697
startTok The present proposal is therefore staunchly inclusive and reciprocal in character, accepting responsibility for a variety of interests in a way which imposes obligations upon others. endTok	47.91756029188742
startTok The Council must now convene in March and make the relevant decision. endTok	57.35352981091649
startTok Thank you for listening. endTok	30.53921492058638
startTok Thank you, too, those who contributed to this matter' s being dealt with swiftly. I am thinking in particular of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. endTok	33.737339878650616
startTok Mr President, first I want to compliment the rapporteur, Charlotte Cederschiöld, on drawing up this report, which is an excellent point of departure for increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro. endTok	21.203309056749227
startTok The euro will enter into circulation on 1 January 2002 and will become one of the world' s most important reserve currencies. endTok	35.05362541243766
startTok Due to its importance on a world scale, the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and forgery. endTok	66.36747611836022
startTok This draft decision therefore lays down a set of minimum standards intended to harmonise criminal law in this field and make its application by each Member State simpler and more effective. endTok	45.19417291099745
startTok It also provides for the euro to be protected even prior to its circulation, which will fill a gap in legislation in some Member States. endTok	55.06237979234261
startTok I expressly support the rapporteur as regards the need to extend this protection to national currencies which can continue to be exchanged after they have been withdrawn from circulation. endTok	61.80046594081824
startTok This means that every Member State must guarantee the establishment of effective, adequate penal sanctions, which act as a deterrent against the offences covered by the draft framework decision. endTok	58.918053592893024
startTok As to the proposal to establish a maximum custodial sentence of not less than eight years, I do not think that this will raise any problems as far as my country is concerned, even though the maximum sentence for counterfeiting under its criminal code is currently five years in prison, as it has already expressed willingness to make this amendment. endTok	67.80876704179923
startTok I also call on those few Member States still harbouring reservations to resolve them so that a decision can rapidly be reached on this matter, for the reasons our rapporteur set out earlier when she called for this to be done. endTok	57.455766703887626
startTok Mr President, this draft framework decision represents the first time a common proposal on crime has been put forward, with legislation to be applied by all fifteen Member States at the same time. endTok	32.20244309406924
startTok We are therefore making progress towards the aim of developing and confirming the status of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, as expressed at Tampere. endTok	31.78839984610549
startTok Mr President, I need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points Mr Coelho made. All that is indeed very true and correct. endTok	73.54614809951829
startTok It is easy to counterfeit the euro. endTok	16.551841018649874
startTok We are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history. endTok	85.81057396766856
startTok It is that a currency that does not even exist yet, that is not in circulation, but exists only as bank deposit money, can nevertheless be counterfeited already. Yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such, counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence. endTok	130.39760758876238
startTok It is a highly complex problem. endTok	30.843932630109176
startTok If we do not act promptly - as Mrs Cederschiöld rightly said - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation. endTok	84.20664120165887
startTok Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people. endTok	33.36987259506673
startTok So what is the European Union doing about it? endTok	33.571567534121336
startTok It is doing a number of things that are right, as Mrs Cederschiöld has described; but, in the context of these things she described, Parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision, not so much at the report drawn up by Mrs Cederschiöld, but more at the procedures that are being applied. endTok	53.13860712072885
startTok The manner in which the Council, which is by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe, consulted the European Parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy. endTok	51.64572704355109
startTok We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time, incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment. endTok	65.7868182029096
startTok Now the European Parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex, difficult and, at times, contradictory Council document in the space of three months. endTok	74.61529438490878
startTok It is only thanks to the immense efforts of Mrs Cederschiöld and to Parliament' s decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the documents available in all the languages, that we have now managed to give our position by the date set by the Council, so that the decision scheduled for March can indeed be taken. endTok	64.50971017059493
startTok On a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the Council is demanding of us. endTok	136.04306589225772
startTok So let me state quite clearly here, on behalf of my group, that we discussed at length with Mrs Cederschiöld whether it is reasonable to work like this. endTok	55.71353639829432
startTok We concluded that it is not, but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure. endTok	51.663990897352605
startTok This framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress. endTok	102.8843436549213
startTok Only, as Mrs Cederschiöld pointed out, in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with. They relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish, the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all Member States, including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited. endTok	52.26593617520174
startTok One reason they have not been dealt with is that as ever the leopard cannot change its spots, i.e. in the case of this framework decision, which specifically relates to judicial cooperation, the Council once again prefers to adhere to the level of government cooperation. endTok	60.13717417959659
startTok That is why, and I quote, this framework decision "is confined to supplementing the provisions of the International Convention of 20 April 1929 for the suppression of counterfeiting and its Protocol" , i.e. the provisions of a timeworn international convention that is a good 71 years old. endTok	51.53940047225855
startTok That means that the legal basis we are now seeking to establish to protect the euro does not derive from Community legislation, as it should, but merely takes the form of provisions supplementing an international convention dating back 71 years. endTok	79.72824882057705
startTok I leave it to the assembled company in this Chamber to decide whether that can be the future of a European Union based on judicial cooperation. endTok	38.31806548785308
startTok Thank you for your attention during our night sitting together. endTok	76.75156580975317
startTok Mr President, the launch of the euro could well be a heaven-sent opportunity for counterfeiters. endTok	43.94188249677099
startTok The fact is people are suddenly going to lose all their currency references, and that means they will be at serious risk of easily accepting forged euros because they are not very familiar with the genuine article. endTok	141.97070956933138
startTok So the Council is naturally worried and is seeking to establish sanctions, primarily criminal, applicable in all the countries of Europe, against offences of this kind. endTok	118.0284293155571
startTok No doubt the Council could have been satisfied with a simple resolution recommending that Member States adopt national legislation to that effect. endTok	92.93398836796064
startTok That is what I would have preferred, personally. endTok	37.8360967695052
startTok But, probably through lack of confidence in the zeal of certain members, the Council has preferred to implement a legal instrument which is more binding at European level: a framework decision. endTok	58.363568928355605
startTok Now that is where the difficulties begin, because criminal law comes under national sovereignty and the Treaty of Maastricht contains no specific provision covering this situation for the euro - so as not to frighten the voters by over-egging the pudding. endTok	106.91486174378753
startTok The draft framework decision before us today tries to cover up this lacuna by referring to Articles 31 and 34(2)(b) of the Treaty. endTok	66.09940367040662
startTok However, I find these passports inadequate. endTok	121.86346369855131
startTok Article 31 only envisages minimum common rules for criminal acts in certain cases, specifically restricted to organised crime, terrorism and drug trafficking. endTok	143.2568519924768
startTok Counterfeiting is not on the list. endTok	127.44080196508384
startTok Article 34, a product of the Treaty of Amsterdam, only lays down the new form of a framework decision, and clearly this only applies to the existing powers of the European Union. endTok	37.28940827204681
startTok So we come back to the previous problem. endTok	52.739851768658596
startTok In other words, the Council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis. endTok	38.124449260025855
startTok In a way, this is deferred punishment for its lack of honesty, at the time, in presenting the Maastricht Treaty to the voters. endTok	44.65401544456101
startTok I would also like to make a more general point. endTok	12.372113070079926
startTok Not so long ago we were dealing with one or more reports on questions of principle relating to the euro in virtually every part-session. endTok	86.3078907738487
startTok But there has been nothing for a year. endTok	34.66242350971258
startTok Just a few little technical reports like this one on counterfeiting. endTok	249.56909560412336
startTok The Commission' s communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, which we have debated this week, contained absolutely nothing on this vast subject, except the reminder, in a single line, that the euro coins and notes are due to come into circulation on 1 January 2002. endTok	43.82597628511289
startTok However, there are many underlying problems yet to be resolved. endTok	52.39183323007096
startTok Let us mention, for example, the disturbing lack of public interest, the definition of monetary policy objectives abusively reduced to the mere fight against inflation, the strange coupling of monetary federalism to a lack budgetary or fiscal federalism, the status of the present applicant countries, when they become members, vis-à-vis the euro zone, the confused reaction of the international markets to this currency with no homogeneous popular foundation, and so on. Do I also need to mention that investors who sold dollars to buy euros have lost 20% since 1 January 1999, 40% if they bought bonds, and no less than 55% if they sold yen to buy euros? endTok	118.75447477757186
startTok Mr President, for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money. endTok	310.9964134195482
startTok These are gigantic problems but they seem to be taboo here. endTok	40.41164148150322
startTok I should like to take over the baton from the previous speaker. endTok	15.172116391627807
startTok There are a number of questions of principle which are demanding solutions, because the point of departure is, of course, that the regulation of criminal law is a national concern. endTok	45.2465164580866
startTok Criminal law is part of each individual nation' s own cultural tradition, and it is very difficult to arrive at common definitions of what is to be understood by these basic legal concepts. endTok	59.83355133004024
startTok I appreciate Mrs Cederschiöld' s work, and my point of departure will be her search - in connection with the Tampere Summit - for common definitions and common regulations regarding what is punishable and what common sanctions can be applied. endTok	74.55675375966055
startTok She would like to devise these sanctions jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offences which have particular relevance for the EU. endTok	121.21275900258934
startTok But the problem is that there is no legal basis for this, and with good reason, because the regulation of criminal law belongs to the sphere of national jurisdiction. endTok	36.71903649748936
startTok In that context, I want to ask the following question of the Commission' s and the Council' s representatives: is the legal basis which has been invoked adequate? endTok	27.258738415660517
startTok In my view, it is clearly in conflict with, and far exceeds the scope of, Article 34, paragraph 2, point b where a legal basis is established for so-called framework decisions which are binding upon the Member States in regard to the desired objectives, but in which it is left to the national authorities to determine the form and methods of implementation. endTok	64.73088825158503
startTok What of course characterises the present draft framework decision is the fact that the Member States' obligations are laid down in detail. There is no freedom of choice regarding methods and implementation. endTok	44.08515204057784
startTok In my view, this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis. endTok	29.270829620490748
startTok I should like an answer from the Commission and the Council, for I consider it obvious that Article 31 does not supply the relevant legal basis. endTok	37.61818809820952
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by warmly congratulating and thanking the rapporteur and pointing out that, in her report, she does not just welcome the draft framework decision but also proposes a few changes, which have been referred to by various speakers but which we cannot discuss in detail now, to supplement and improve the text. endTok	50.017911545069964
startTok It is crucially important to continue the success story of the euro and we must make every effort not to spoil this success story or put it at risk by taking inadequate measures to prevent counterfeiting - and we are well aware of the initial attempts that are being made. endTok	48.60794119988221
startTok We have all noted that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risks with it. endTok	74.44982071137349
startTok So, in addition to the efforts to combat counterfeiting, to ensure the sound implementation of the provisions, the planned information campaign will of course play a key role and here we still have serious work to do. endTok	73.26731408234949
startTok We are also concerned with the question of cooperation. endTok	22.21347191644407
startTok We need to define the precise responsibilities of the ECB, the national central banks, the Commission and Europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro. endTok	55.95159928799258
startTok I also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or EU body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work. endTok	118.57793131042763
startTok In the same context, we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock, together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities. endTok	75.13735343112792
startTok Aside from the report, which we welcome, many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved. endTok	54.59414087863544
startTok I hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification. endTok	75.71806947530568
startTok Mr President, Mrs Cederschiöld, ladies and gentlemen, how safe is the euro? endTok	40.89284639465021
startTok That is, after all, a question the people often ask. endTok	225.36660325835382
startTok And that question will of course become increasingly pressing with the approach of 1 January 2002, the date when they will have euros in their pockets. endTok	70.3709715242959
startTok For the safety of the euro is not just a matter of the stability and external value of the currency but, in fact, also of protecting the euro against counterfeiting. endTok	52.24917858822757
startTok That too is a concern of the people, for, as has rightly been said, this will be a new currency for them, new in terms of how it looks and also how it is used. endTok	76.84450775843816
startTok Of course all the citizens of the EU Member States will also be faced with the novelty of a currency that is valid over such a wider area, and even beyond Europe, as a reserve currency. endTok	37.97619639399472
startTok They will need time to get used to that too. endTok	84.22515370269319
startTok So it is clearly necessary to ask what the EU is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting. endTok	47.52335685638179
startTok And that is what we are discussing at this late hour. endTok	18.5348005870322
startTok This really is a subject that is close to the citizen, so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour. endTok	40.806624086534015
startTok But that cannot be helped. endTok	46.606516471380246
startTok Of course, the European Central Bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time. endTok	19.816488227137704
startTok After all, it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting. endTok	63.873538922810326
startTok As has also been pointed out, in summer 1998 the Commission submitted a communication listing a very wide variety of areas where measures need to be taken, such as information, further training - an important area, cooperation between the euro-states and of course even beyond them, and measures under criminal law. endTok	63.38744200190048
startTok That is what this framework decision is about. endTok	28.62776443403815
startTok Mrs Cederschiöld, let me offer you sincere thanks on behalf of the Commission and, above all, let me also thank Parliament for being prepared to give its position in the space of such a short time. endTok	36.77623037343202
startTok I certainly appreciate that. endTok	58.21633986518366
startTok The framework decision aims to ensure that the Member States apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences. endTok	46.4798137976312
startTok Of course the first condition for uniform action is always to have uniform definitions and, as was emphasised, what we are basically trying to do is to ensure that the euro is protected even before it is physically introduced. endTok	62.625420156173305
startTok Naturally, the Commission is also glad that the European Parliament' s prompt decision - and I hope the vote will be in favour - means the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now, so that we can begin to transpose it. endTok	45.08466883543723
startTok For the Commission has been asked to report, as it will in the first half of next year, on the progress in transposing it in the Member States, on whether the serious nature of this issue is being matched by serious action. endTok	48.33267273844371
startTok It has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law. endTok	15.291776304450071
startTok In that respect we must recognise this innovation, this step, even if, as Mr Schulz just pointed out, simply supplementing a rather old convention is not really a particularly bold step. endTok	108.400168066663
startTok In reply to the question whether the Commission considers that the framework decision has an adequate legal basis under the Treaty, the Commission believes that the right basis is being applied here. endTok	50.8907926572071
startTok The framework decision will, however, have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future. endTok	44.61492852927517
startTok The Commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authorities and on cooperation with Europol. endTok	35.61399389155188
startTok That proposal will establish a duty to cooperate, and a duty on the part of the national authorities to notify Europol of cases of counterfeiting and to present any confiscated counterfeit money to the European Central Bank for identification and classification, so that effective measures can then be taken. endTok	54.65092126795256
startTok On the question of coordinating the various measures, since early 1998, the Commission, followed now by OLAF, has been working with experts on the subject from the Member States, the European Central Bank and Europol on means of effectively combating counterfeiting of the euro in advance. endTok	78.25318948455809
startTok As Mr Karas just pointed out, a few weeks ago the Commission submitted a proposal for an information campaign on the euro, to which it proposed allocating as much as EUR 32 million. endTok	29.337398347500056
startTok That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use, a large amount; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting. endTok	68.82823910634707
startTok I believe that this debate shortly before midnight will also teach a salutary lesson to all those counterfeiters who believe their hour has come, because they think the EU is no longer awake at this late hour! endTok	53.0741345390913
startTok Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer. endTok	6.680157399458114
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m. endTok	2.8274191598571785
startTok (The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.) endTok	5.024182827310835
startTok Resumption of the sitting endTok	41.75579425918733
startTok The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed. endTok	14.154465199446003
startTok Are there any comments? endTok	12.892326383115599
startTok (The Minutes were approved) endTok	22.452217819019545
startTok Mr President, I should like make a comment in connection with a meeting held last night by various Members of Parliament from all groups. endTok	46.39323601986513
startTok The purpose of the meeting, which was attended by several Vice-Presidents and Quaestors, together with the architects who designed this building, was to discuss how we could improve our working conditions. endTok	68.18786892595229
startTok We discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you, Mr President, in fact conceals a huge window which, if the curtain were drawn back, would afford a wonderful view over the river. endTok	125.23591037711384
startTok We were told that the curtain was closed so that you would not have your back to the light and to improve the lighting during debates. endTok	59.073732858706926
startTok But what is to prevent us, before the sitting is opened or when you close the sitting, opening the curtains and enjoying the apparently magnificent view behind you? endTok	115.62623456302124
startTok I am more than happy for our House to be illuminated by the brilliance of our debates but a little real sunlight on our bubble of democracy from time to time would not come amiss. endTok	52.72154696826513
startTok I think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss opening this curtain from time to time with the ushers. endTok	48.16767478696502
startTok Thank you very much Mr Onesta, I am grateful for any suggestions that will make our Chamber more conducive to human comfort. endTok	30.201367970237925
startTok I would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being. endTok	57.32006526557376
startTok In the meantime, I will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter, technically speaking. endTok	43.626106603052705
startTok If so, then we will have a trial run for half an hour and see how it looks when the President sits with his back to the light! endTok	85.51455537273668
startTok UCITS endTok	2164.514121387898
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my hope that Parliament is prepared now to make a decision to extend and strengthen the financial market in Europe. endTok	23.822481597629615
startTok As a new Member of the European Parliament, it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter. endTok	29.73755589252816
startTok I should especially like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their willingness to find compromises; the President and the Bureau for lending a sensitive ear to this complex issue; the Commission, and especially the Commissioner, for being such worthwhile contacts; the Council; and also the division responsible for servicing the committee, for its selfless work. endTok	47.71410154239668
startTok There was a good deal of agreement within the committee, apart from on a matter which, too, I hope it will be possible to solve. endTok	46.97183193083666
startTok The issue of UCITS may appear difficult, technical and a political minefield. endTok	77.8533498723284
startTok I believe that some people do not even know what UCITS stands for. endTok	39.62144068940126
startTok Allow me, however, to state very clearly that this is a question which really does affect the citizens of Europe in so far as it relates to how their savings are administered, what options there are available, how competition operates between countries in regard to different forms of savings, savers' demand for security, and the opportunities Europe' s citizens have to save wisely for their old age. endTok	78.08549361284781
startTok It is a question of weighing demands for liberalisation in the interests of a better market and higher yield against investors' need for protection and security. endTok	76.75240756833522
startTok In the course of the 1980s, most markets in Europe underwent drastic deregulation. As a result, the national money and bond markets in particular developed very quickly over a period of a few years. endTok	61.545910068150675
startTok Collective investment undertakings became an alternative to saving with a bank. endTok	106.11851157411562
startTok In my own country, more than 60 per cent of Swedes save with a variety of funds. endTok	35.54088477935432
startTok The security afforded by this type of saving is attributable to the broad range of investment vehicles in which the funds are placed. endTok	55.624292104304445
startTok The capital and securities market has continued to be developed. endTok	61.77056238797482
startTok The current Directive on UCITS has become antiquated and outdated. endTok	48.287694774533115
startTok New types of funds have been introduced in the various Member States which are not permitted to market their units in other Member States. endTok	29.368533747724122
startTok Obviously, this inhibits competition and innovation and restricts the public' s range of savings options. endTok	90.00022102491766
startTok The Commission' s proposal with which we are dealing today is in two parts. endTok	33.242517947211226
startTok The first concerns the product, that is to say the funds. endTok	33.3875634654577
startTok The other concerns the collective investment undertakings. endTok	76.1565681513722
startTok The main purpose of the first proposal is to extend the investment opportunities of collective investment undertakings by allowing them to invest in units in other collective investment undertakings, for example units in funds, standardised options and futures contracts and deposits in credit institutions and in certain types of money market instruments. endTok	76.60673795258829
startTok Special risk-spreading rules are proposed in respect of such investments, involving both quantitative and qualitative criteria. endTok	106.24245575865763
startTok In addition, the Commission' s proposal puts forward special risk-spreading rules for funds whose aim is to replicate a particular stock index, a so-called index fund. endTok	74.25620500122668
startTok The committee wishes to make the requirements in relation to the Commission' s proposal more stringent. endTok	30.01667164364446
startTok To guarantee transparency and prudence, investments in non-harmonised funds should only be allowed on condition that qualitative criteria, for example a transparency requirement and investor protection, are introduced. endTok	86.15242462835607
startTok In addition, quantitative criteria (risk exposure) should be introduced. endTok	69.9435697349041
startTok Moving on now, then, to the point where there is (or, I hope, was) a lack of agreement, namely OTC derivatives. endTok	128.0521363450882
startTok The Commission' s proposal makes a distinction between derivatives dealt in on regulated markets and derivative instruments not dealt in on regulated markets (so-called OTC derivatives). endTok	103.31233975336235
startTok The Commission' s proposal takes it as read that OTC derivatives are not one of the general types of investment that UCITS deal in, but that they should only be used to achieve efficient portfolio management and to hedge exchange-rate risks. endTok	86.85127376241515
startTok In recent years, the derivatives market has grown very rapidly in almost all the Member States. endTok	49.842288127351814
startTok It is therefore important that regulation of derivatives is flexible so that the market is not tied down ahead of future developments. endTok	74.4824882819827
startTok The definitions 'standardised futures contracts' and 'standardised options' should therefore be combined to form a new definition, 'financial derivative instruments' , which also covers OTC derivatives. endTok	94.03636992666652
startTok Investment in OTC derivatives, however, should only be allowed on condition that both quantitative and qualitative criteria are introduced. endTok	71.74656318366644
startTok They are very important in this case. endTok	18.677863955702318
startTok They must be introduced to guarantee the protection of investors. endTok	38.066356630111606
startTok The Commission' s second proposal focuses on the bodies which manage UCITS, that is to say management companies. endTok	50.5255020045166
startTok The rules for management companies, for example the conditions for starting up and conducting business, are brought into line with the existing rules and regulations. endTok	48.79376643306761
startTok A crucial point is that rules are proposed for so-called simplified prospectuses. endTok	54.59662704042402
startTok Relevant information must be given to prospective unit-holders in a fund in a language which is readily understandable to investors in the host country. endTok	49.03188675856807
startTok In this regard, too, the committee is prepared to go further than the Commission. endTok	23.34222669263706
startTok A question which has also been discussed in the committee is that of the capital contribution to be required from management companies. endTok	47.41169069172607
startTok There are different views on this. endTok	25.270793084697875
startTok One of the most important things, for me, personally, is that the common regulations should not cause smaller companies to go under. endTok	55.12527204093566
startTok During the months that I have been working on this report, one very clear demand has emerged, both from industry and from those who represent the consumer. endTok	80.94710908252402
startTok The current situation is not good. endTok	15.72733342077919
startTok Both savers and the industry need modernised regulations for the whole of Europe. endTok	67.56511842740827
startTok I believe that today' s proposal strikes a good balance between liberalisation of the market and the desire for effective protection for investors. endTok	35.9487456666279
startTok I just want to conclude by saying that a number of Members of Parliament think that the present proposal goes too far, while others think that I am not sufficiently liberal. endTok	32.833391077664935
startTok To them I just want to say, as the English expression goes, 'You can' t have it all.' endTok	119.11357591873099
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok Mr President, at the outset I wish to place on the official record of the House my thanks for the tremendous work undertaken by Mr Schmidt, our rapporteur. endTok	44.53440452423802
startTok I was in fact the surrogate father of these reports during the previous Parliament. endTok	27.57362561346874
startTok We failed over the last six years to get any compromise or agreement with regard to this matter. endTok	58.15543916946346
startTok In a short space of time Mr Schmidt has managed to bring it forward to this final stage within Parliament. I thank him for that. endTok	52.78031835985729
startTok As the draftsperson for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I also wish to place on record my thanks to the secretariat of both the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee for their cooperation on this matter. endTok	22.100202618363
startTok I am speaking today wearing a number of hats: firstly, as the surrogate father of this report; secondly, as the draftsperson of the opinion; and most importantly, as one who sees the tremendous advantages which can be gained for the European Union from a harmonised system of UCITS investment to ensure that monies presently being earned in Europe but invested outside the European Union and not put to the benefit of the Union economy can be retained within the economy for the creation of entrepreneurship, employment and also for guaranteeing future pension rights. endTok	62.39039938138052
startTok There is little disagreement amongst Members with regard to the first proposal. endTok	46.16548658425742
startTok It puts into place a certain number of controls and mechanisms to ensure that we can have this kind of harmonised regulatory authorities. endTok	60.48613294018981
startTok However, it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern. endTok	30.493407401867056
startTok I have a number of ideas which should be put across. endTok	30.650958277913272
startTok Firstly, the idea of an EU passport for management companies is to be welcomed; and the home-state approval rule is also to be welcomed. endTok	67.37848261595639
startTok However, instead of imposing a new regime, we could have used the Investment Services Directive as the analogy for this regime. endTok	78.14605967885694
startTok It seems unusual that we failed to grasp that opportunity. endTok	41.555248871378474
startTok Many Members have been working on the basis of trying to protect their own countries' national interests rather than improving the overall system for Europe. endTok	42.074480575930515
startTok We will have to revisit this issue again in the near future. endTok	16.918363983203204
startTok I call on Members to ensure by their votes today or that we can put Europe on a sound footing for the short term, if not for the long term. endTok	71.64608622071249
startTok Mr President, I must firstly thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, my colleague, Mr Goebbels, and Mrs Villiers and Mrs Lulling from my Group. Despite their differing opinions on some points, they have consistently worked in an extremely constructive manner. endTok	27.737561993685254
startTok As indicated by the rapporteur, we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this Parliament. endTok	25.442975799834556
startTok Collective investment undertakings have for some time been the primary savings vehicle through which millions of ordinary citizens, without any specialist knowledge, have invested their life savings. endTok	165.3533465892404
startTok This is the main reason why we must proceed with liberalisation, albeit in a prudent manner. endTok	32.072385823892404
startTok I say this because the failure of a bank is a problem for which any government can find a solution. endTok	60.49429578705972
startTok However, the failure and suspension of payments of this type of undertaking would create a political, social and personal problem with incalculable consequences. endTok	80.13328500410323
startTok There is also a second reason why prudence is needed in the regulation of these undertakings. endTok	32.86163914449645
startTok I believe in a social market economy based on a successful market operating subject to certain rules intended to guarantee the general interest. Specifically, at the moment, this means the protection of investors. endTok	67.04312666624583
startTok This basic principle of liberalisation, increased competition and greater investment opportunities, together with prudence to ensure the protection which investors deserve, has determined and inspired my Group' s position on most of the controversial points which have arisen. endTok	111.57567754381053
startTok Firstly, there is the problem of investment in non-harmonised undertakings falling outside this directive. endTok	58.11139181724502
startTok It is clear that by extending the proposal under discussion, the options and the range of investments in undertakings for collective investments, those undertakings which remain outside the rules will be obliged to invest in high-risk funds. endTok	73.65873726333666
startTok It would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments. endTok	57.85409690794654
startTok Secondly, the problem of derivatives is one which has created the most divisions, both within my Group and between the groups. endTok	67.0175246640042
startTok We have achieved a compromise solution. endTok	24.423561362140447
startTok Everyone accepts that investments in derivatives must be legally limited in order to prevent a harmonised fund losing all its assets due to an investment in high-risk products. endTok	105.29781205153607
startTok It is clear that this risk is greater when the investment is in derivatives not dealt in on a regulated market, namely the famous OTC derivatives. endTok	91.76551419063217
startTok We have achieved an acceptable compromise solution on this, or so we believe, which I welcome. endTok	86.47856367881246
startTok As this issue will be returning to this House at some stage, I must highlight the working method used between the Commission and this Parliament. endTok	46.47356416657289
startTok The texts before us today are old and were already old when they reached this House. This was because they were substantially amended during the Finnish Presidency. endTok	104.47190168535042
startTok We are therefore faced with two options. We can either return the proposals to the Commission for the latter to present a harmonised text or we can continue the current process. endTok	70.77273308907775
startTok This second option has won the day and I am pleased about this. However, in the future I hope that the coordination between these two institutions and the Council can be improved so that our work is more understandable and more productive. endTok	35.896706890540436
startTok Mr President, the Socialist Group supports the Commission' s efforts to implement the action plan for financial services. endTok	19.22994274377235
startTok Obviously, in the wake of the introduction of the euro, we need to create an integrated European financial market which is similar to the American and Japanese markets. endTok	32.03037970658622
startTok The debates on UCITS gave rise to speeches on behalf of all sorts of lobbies and heated debate in the relevant committee. endTok	31.012136378847522
startTok I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and also Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, for their constructive approach. endTok	16.31657937211309
startTok The Socialists recognise the importance of the investment fund industry to the development of our economies and to the allocation of resources. endTok	33.02537045424828
startTok But the world of international finance is a dangerous one. endTok	60.486652099061146
startTok The capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses. endTok	50.4978273766033
startTok There is at present a surfeit of cash looking for a home. endTok	55.883980203865555
startTok In 1999, the increase in the means of payment in the world resulted in over-stimulated stock exchanges and an explosion in the volume of transactions, pushing up the prices of long-term financial and real assets. endTok	59.28921998347138
startTok And as international financial activity speeds up, the risks increase. endTok	223.3328529752872
startTok You do not need a Nobel prize in economics to realise that the current working hypothesis of the financial markets, which anticipate annual growth in profits of the order of 15 to 25% is quite simply unrealistic in the medium term. endTok	61.11653664007565
startTok I adamantly believe that the main risk to the world economy in the foreseeable future is not inflation, but deflation generated as the speculative bubbles, created by what Alan Greenspan calls irrationally exuberant markets, burst. endTok	48.085358496534965
startTok The legislature has a duty to contain the risk inherent in the continuing deregulation of the European financial markets. endTok	35.71314565051495
startTok By definition, investment funds use other people' s money. endTok	273.82983312106325
startTok The legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clauses. endTok	131.5897616185778
startTok There is no freedom without rules. endTok	106.13045414095289
startTok We have done away with so-called master-feeder structures. endTok	57.15232663311749
startTok These feeder funds exist in the United States, which is an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system. endTok	40.65276768170036
startTok The European market is still fragmented and such structures would doubtless cause problems. endTok	82.53908213283943
startTok The Socialists, like the Commission, question the advisability of allowing investment funds to invest in so-called over-the-counter derivatives, i.e. products negotiated between professionals by private contract. endTok	80.37448824861417
startTok As these transactions are generally not subject to prudential control, the risks are all the more obvious. endTok	113.51576205169438
startTok The Socialist Group has tabled amendments proposing both quantitative and qualitative safeguard clauses in order to contain the risks to investors. endTok	74.23308709967293
startTok By adopting these amendments, Parliament will allow recourse to OTC derivatives but will also limit the risk to private investors. endTok	85.43919281915672
startTok Mr President, there is much talk at present of the principle of good governance. endTok	32.33573366176816
startTok This principle should not only guide the public sector, it should also guide the private sector, especially financial undertakings. endTok	54.495488789388794
startTok Mr President, our objective in setting a framework for unit trusts and other UCTIS is to secure the highest possible safe return for our savers, which is why I want to address the issue of derivatives in my remarks today. endTok	43.96844860673387
startTok I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure, safer, higher returns. endTok	94.64826630445121
startTok Despite their image of danger, derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance. endTok	207.04818536455562
startTok A contract that, for example, pays a substantial sum if, say, the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index falls, causes an extra payment by the investor if the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index rises. endTok	128.9020299507031
startTok Is this speculative? endTok	229.29458452768267
startTok Not at all. endTok	88.41341539335296
startTok Imagine you have spent some months building up a portfolio of shares in companies in which you are confident: they have good management, good prospects and they are good investments. endTok	194.6566764723843
startTok Then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse, as it did in 1987. endTok	74.05666557259306
startTok You have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash, but that would be to waste your research into the winners. endTok	83.17863026598583
startTok It would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall. endTok	105.9274111267453
startTok The solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 falls. endTok	74.44151407162991
startTok But even with a tailor-made derivative or OTC derivative which would be cheaper, perhaps insuring you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index, you would still have the portfolio and the shares, but you would have protected yourself against the risks of a collapse. endTok	136.65929891069553
startTok In exchange, you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets. endTok	48.26092369632707
startTok In this case, which is perhaps the most common use of derivatives by asset managers, you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk. endTok	140.51998115636954
startTok That is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund. endTok	70.39721681362275
startTok History demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light-handed approach to regulation. endTok	176.04214705327445
startTok Heavy-handedness - a prescription of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers. endTok	104.4634831062463
startTok Pension funds which suffered from rules on where they could and could not invest, as required by of our government bonds, made returns of 5.2% a year, barely half the 9.5% annual returns made by free funds between 1984 and 1996. endTok	173.2135592970912
startTok These are of course the returns after deducting all losses. endTok	110.33800546277683
startTok Do not confuse a real concern for the interests of investors with a populist fear of the new and the innovative and liberal approach that pays off. endTok	65.70245674738774
startTok This is what we should be concerned about here today. endTok	20.54663561098051
startTok Mr President, the report presented to us today seeks to complete the free movement of financial investments in Europe, including the most sophisticated forms of investment. endTok	36.65840916097203
startTok We do not, in principle, oppose this industry. endTok	53.96274419722088
startTok However, unlike Mr Christopher Huhne, we feel that a continent which has proved incapable of controlling its oil industry properly should not overly deregulate an industry which may, in time, provoke the same type of crisis. endTok	76.20804287652625
startTok We shall therefore vote cautiously on all amendments limiting recourse to excessively derivative instruments and we shall vote in favour of all amendments which limit the excessive concentration of assets within a single financial group. endTok	75.62569658268808
startTok But we make no bones about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole. endTok	26.131422898400796
startTok We shall also vote in the future against any proposals to deregulate the financial markets and we call on all the other political groups to do likewise until such time as taxation on investment income is finally harmonised. endTok	67.65077473178356
startTok For years certain countries, including Great Britain, have been blocking harmonisation and turning their financial centres into tax havens. endTok	169.3176155175177
startTok They even reject the strict minimum, i.e. the Monti package proposed by the Commission in Brussels. endTok	100.49283596621365
startTok This attitude is turning Europe into a machine which exempts investment income from tax and shifts the whole tax burden to commercial income, with all the social and even moral consequences which that implies. endTok	128.6489189054842
startTok We must put an end to this. endTok	12.577331600552581
startTok By blocking the demands of the financial industry, the European Parliament has the means to ensure that countries which have been turned into tax havens end up with their back against the wall. endTok	51.809148604909055
startTok Mr President, the 1985 directive introduced a sort of European visa for certain types of UCITS which could be marketed throughout the Union. endTok	30.988928316907792
startTok Since then, the capital market and transferable securities have not just continued to evolve; thanks to unbridled financial globalisation, they have exploded exponentially and without restraint. endTok	90.02365591095638
startTok This brings us to the two proposals for directives. endTok	43.12648321133499
startTok The second proposal, on which the report is excellent, does not require any particular comment. endTok	46.98293140884737
startTok It aims to strengthen consumer protection and security. endTok	39.281773456420325
startTok It is a step in the right direction, even if one wonders why in heaven, with what right and with what respect for our citizens, we are further bolstering the monopoly of the English language in all documents distributed throughout Europe. endTok	64.42846104287042
startTok That is the thrust of an amendment which we have tabled; it favours all the languages of the Community and our agreement to the second directive will depend on it. endTok	41.41022820152004
startTok The same cannot be said of the first proposal. endTok	30.543503799178254
startTok We might have been able to agree to the original text insofar as it was informed by a legitimate concern to update current legislation. endTok	50.37474007916204
startTok However, we are unable to agree to the text of the report, although I welcome the work carried out by Mr Schmidt, for several reasons. endTok	23.95494179709666
startTok First, it leans too far towards products based on indexes which have no bearing on the real economy; derivatives which will help to swell the financial bubble which Mr Lipietz referred to just now. endTok	58.29578680814267
startTok Secondly, like him, I think that we should not promote excessive concentration in funds which, in the final analysis, will prove to be a Trojan horse for American pension funds. endTok	54.549318281648056
startTok There is, of course, no reciprocity in favour of European UCITS. endTok	30.869048609580382
startTok We shall also vote against the abolition of the facility for the Member States to increase to 35% ... endTok	21.810172297259683
startTok (The President cut the speaker off) endTok	8.491221292876252
startTok Mr President, this is a vital issue for Europe. endTok	17.451311717885577
startTok A Europe that faces an impending pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of Europe can obtain on their savings. endTok	65.57732123184047
startTok I welcome many of the developments which Mr Schmidt' s report brings us. endTok	42.144095400322996
startTok UCITS are a success story within the European Union. endTok	23.1720147461427
startTok They are a safe product, traded cross-border. endTok	89.7085263652597
startTok But it is time for the legislation to be updated. endTok	18.44112905061297
startTok Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job here. endTok	66.22105139336125
startTok It is no secret that I would have much preferred Mr Schmidt' s report not to have been altered so much as it passed through Parliament. endTok	38.86528414478799
startTok But I appeal to this House to take a balanced and common-sense approach on this issue. endTok	29.19781188382056
startTok The radical step taken by this report is to allow UCITS to use over-the-counter derivatives. endTok	59.57794877700519
startTok I appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by UCITS. endTok	48.294694993505814
startTok We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculation. We are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce risk and to increase the returns on the savings of ordinary Europeans. endTok	45.7566146067416
startTok Mr Schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of Parliament for over-the-counter derivatives. endTok	48.95419743163935
startTok We must not be afraid to go forward, to react to changes in the market. endTok	37.45788015548641
startTok Yes, we need to continue to ensure that UCITS provide a balanced and protected product for consumers. endTok	54.21289144930861
startTok The report gives very adequate protection for consumers. endTok	74.58662294290411
startTok But a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over-the-counter derivatives. endTok	47.24814703071685
startTok I feel these derivatives will be an addition to the portfolio of unit trusts, which can only help individual people around Europe obtain a high return on their savings. endTok	95.31662518751031
startTok I salute Mr Schmidt. endTok	100.29646549521301
startTok Thank you very much Mr Kuckelkorn. endTok	8.109524817298277
startTok Ladies and gentlemen, I have an update for you on the curtain and window situation. endTok	50.64283569279276
startTok If we open this curtain, then we will find that there is a partition wall behind it which cannot just be removed straight away. endTok	46.27871916575942
startTok We will therefore have to defer this experiment until the next plenary sitting. However, I will make sure that we have a go then and see how the land lies. endTok	60.6323944040223
startTok Mr President, the UCITS directive has been an enormous success since it entered into force on 1 October 1989, mainly thanks to the excellent protection which it offers investors. endTok	85.02075578987565
startTok The directive and the reputation which UCITS enjoy with investors have allowed the investment fund industry to multiply its assets in the European Union fivefold. endTok	64.88419619828929
startTok There has been a strong increase in cross-border marketing of investments within the European Union and the directive itself is used as a model for legislation throughout the world. endTok	30.319984823859258
startTok However, the directive is ten years old and, now that the markets have developed and more and more sophisticated financial products are available, it is somewhat outdated. endTok	90.10022662762847
startTok The Commission proposals being debated here will give it the face-lift it needs. endTok	130.18866911869222
startTok I share some of the concerns expressed here, especially by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, but this face-lift would be even more successful if the funds which simply reproduce a stock exchange index, and which are therefore managed either passively or not at all, and the funds which use an index as a benchmark for an actively-managed fund were treated in the same way, if only to allow medium-sized undertakings listed on the stock exchange but not included in the stock exchange index better access to the capital market. endTok	75.64740850643952
startTok In addition, investors often have better protection with an actively-managed fund. endTok	231.45744158538062
startTok My Amendment No 47 is therefore a warning for amateurs. endTok	66.19516359531244
startTok As far as the proposal for a new provision limiting investments in the same group to 15% is concerned, I would like to stress that, apart from the fact that this limit is too low, the text does not define the concept of a group. This concept does not exist under European law because it is impossible to implement and equally impossible to control in practice. endTok	45.22526985605652
startTok I shall therefore vote against this proposed amendment. endTok	24.1901611804296
startTok To conclude, Mr President, allow me to remind the House that the directive needs a makeover which will make UCITS even more attractive, but it does not need to be strapped into a European corset which will squeeze the life out of it. endTok	35.33870555751069
startTok - (DE) Mr President, the introduction of the euro and the further liberalisation of capital markets has already produced a larger and deeper European financial area, which is helping to open up markets and create price transparency, but also to increase competition. endTok	68.9454071699377
startTok At the same time, it is important to appreciate the economic importance of financial business dealings, particularly those we are concerned with today. endTok	36.426051658667376
startTok At the end of 1999 there were almost 15 000 investment funds registered as UCITS with a total value of in excess of EUR 2 billion, thereby accounting for roughly 75% of all funds assets. endTok	98.30615160190314
startTok Hence the Commission rightly cited the economic importance thereof in its proposals for draft directives, and I must say that I actually have every confidence in the Commission' s proposal. endTok	57.49890583879259
startTok We are all aware how difficult it is to improve a legal framework for investment funds, and how difficult it is to construct the European passport for management companies around particular standards which are to apply even-handedly across the board. endTok	61.73593360677923
startTok This therefore represents a step forward in respect of the legal and supervisory stipulations for financial markets and financial products. endTok	50.15611245327998
startTok It is also my primary concern to optimise consumer protection in this way and I think it is very important for this to be reflected in the Commission' s proposal and that of the European Parliament, as well as in the compromise motions. endTok	23.1898219711981
startTok However, I do not believe that we can assess the risk associated with the OTC derivatives, and I also think that as a European Parliament it is our duty to inform and impress again and again on consumers - who expect investment funds to be comparable with a traditional savings agreement when it comes to long-term security, and indeed that is why they were known as investment savings - that these products do not bear comparison and that is why we need a minimum level of protection. endTok	54.31667791066303
startTok Why do we not take our cue from the minimum level of protection afforded by the trade in transferable securities directive, Article 11 for example, which relates to good practice? endTok	59.6992932995665
startTok I therefore believe that this is another step forward we can take and I think it would also be a positive move if consumers and investors could be made aware of a fund' s name so as to be able to learn something about its risk profile. endTok	57.58885105742632
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal for a directive now under discussion brings with it several welcome reforms to the current legal provisions. endTok	100.80656934057855
startTok The preparatory work has largely consisted of a viable balance between increasing the efficacy and growth of the European investment markets and preserving a sufficient level of protection for consumers who buy fund units. endTok	80.03991470263638
startTok The greater the trust consumers have in investment market operations, the more consumers will be prepared to invest on the open market. endTok	150.09617347108951
startTok And the more consumers invest, the brighter the prospects will be in the European business money markets. endTok	174.36660223986252
startTok It is quite clear that when businesses can more easily have access to their own capital-based finances their financial structure will be more firmly based, and, thus, opportunities for growth and investment will also improve. endTok	92.29448230778127
startTok Whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS is not relevant here. endTok	122.6650878868873
startTok Although in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we were very much in agreement with the aims of the legislative amendment, the debate we had was not the easiest one. endTok	41.03424521249247
startTok For me personally at least, difficulties were caused by the directive' s technical division into two different proposals, which certainly did not make it easier to familiarise oneself with this very difficult technical subject. endTok	71.2528200409904
startTok However, I would like to express my position with regard to a few detailed proposals. endTok	18.61237523112238
startTok Firstly, I am very satisfied that the proposal for a directive as a whole increases the scope of investment funds for targeting capital at different instruments. endTok	42.35255126751801
startTok As regards derivatives, I consider the position adopted by the committee justified - unlike Mrs Randzio-Plath, for example. endTok	50.08923927181297
startTok The directive should not treat over-the-counter derivatives differently from standard derivatives because they are used in many Member States and were also used before. endTok	104.22103068073437
startTok With regard to Article 5g of the other proposal for a directive, the so-called Article on Delegation, I think the Commission' s original proposal on rules concerning authorisation was better than the one now approved in the committee, so I would support some of Mrs Villiers' amendments to this point. endTok	62.19883593119501
startTok Mr President, I see two problems with this morning' s debate. endTok	33.796343021488866
startTok Firstly, when I came to this Parliament many years ago I was told that if you had a difficult job you gave it to a Liberal. endTok	56.015293521273044
startTok Now I have been told that if you have a difficult debate you know you are in trouble if half the Luxembourg Members are in the Chamber at one time - and they are. endTok	83.59625209984553
startTok Firstly, I welcome proposal No 1. endTok	134.1634481310117
startTok It simplifies things and brings things up to date. endTok	172.45329690155785
startTok I think many of the British Members will be voting against a large number of the amendments in the report. endTok	25.832334137216332
startTok We support the Schmidt report on proposal No 1, but we regret the fact that the directive sets a lot of quantity limits that restrict the ability to spread risks. endTok	85.60443323977914
startTok We believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward. endTok	32.414226066938255
startTok Secondly, we consider proposal No 2 to be very confused. endTok	161.93405711870682
startTok It is difficult to understand, and we think the Commission would be well advised to look at it again. endTok	28.859649279296484
startTok If further regulation is needed, we feel that it could be better achieved by other means than those proposed in the directive. endTok	81.12095054003372
startTok In particular, we disagree with the proposal on capital requirements because if they are put too high they could actually drive some businesses out of the industry altogether. endTok	105.94842542320922
startTok We ask the Commission to look again at these proposals. endTok	34.188528160170854
startTok Finally, we would urge Members to vote in particular against Amendment No 41 on capital requirements, because we feel that this would be very bad for the industry. endTok	57.14949245867923
startTok Mr President, money does not smell, as the Romans would say. endTok	49.36584814446763
startTok The important thing is for money to generate more money. endTok	76.15253737279505
startTok This is the only opportunity that we have to see to it that the interests of economists converge with those of people who want to earn money and have their mind set on dollars, like Disney' s Scrooge McDuck, who has dollar signs for eyes, except in this case the symbol is that of the euro. endTok	55.016818603286545
startTok In this we are combining the interests of these citizens with the interests of pensioners who want to live life in tranquillity. endTok	53.331401642233295
startTok For example, my brother-in-law, who lives in Rome, started drawing his pension a year ago and every day since - from seven in the morning when he wakes until midnight - he has checked the TV screen to see how the pensions funds and the securities in which he has invested are performing. endTok	115.35253862551457
startTok Pensioners will, in the future - as is already happening - have enormous sums of money at their disposal. endTok	68.76689331915874
startTok Indeed, whilst the young are penniless, the elderly have accumulated money and, since they are keen to turn it to good advantage, harbour great hopes for this directive. endTok	128.7786667420686
startTok If national governments had in their hearts - as the European Union has in its heart with this directive - the proliferation of money earned during the course of a working life, the pensions time bomb would already have been defused. endTok	70.90778255855031
startTok You too, in your role, Commissioner Bolkestein, have a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly and of pensioners, a future that I hope will improve once we have finalised this directive, by which I mean very soon, as has been proposed by Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi. endTok	60.449428169966644
startTok . (NL) Mr President, could I first of all express my heartfelt thanks to rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has principal authority, as well as the rapporteur, Mr Brian Crowley and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, whom I would like to thank for their thorough and important work on the refinement and extension of the proposals. endTok	20.102491514963162
startTok Since the approval of Directive 85/611, the investment funds sector has undergone lengthy development and it is now important to modernise the rules. endTok	72.48070778560077
startTok The aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors, which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro. endTok	39.41607909608912
startTok Since the average European family puts its savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions on prudent management - and I would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk-spreading are concerned. endTok	90.38750553788113
startTok The two proposals form a coherent whole. endTok	127.15884460699709
startTok The first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an 'undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities' (UCITS) can invest. endTok	69.84421896587233
startTok As already remarked in this session, UCITS are key players within the modern capital markets. endTok	110.91324738032503
startTok Their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets, in which the principle of risk-spreading is taken into consideration, protected by appropriate supervision. endTok	88.79298250245822
startTok Since diverse types of investment are permitted, private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques. endTok	97.36551937527402
startTok The second proposal expands the role which these important intermediary organisations can play within the EU capital markets in terms of developing the investment funds sector. endTok	71.76644277654516
startTok By allowing branches to be set up and certain services to be provided on a cross-border basis, these organisations will at long last be able to apply the freedoms of the Treaty of Rome, which they have been denied for all these years. endTok	59.27146826312338
startTok The Commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas. endTok	22.78028028104652
startTok The Commission will adopt Amendments Nos - and I am now referring to the most recent numbering - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 for the first proposal, and 23, 28 and 32 for the second proposal, since these are really very useful clarifications and improvements. endTok	59.73340631813909
startTok I also value the ideas put forward in Amendments Nos 1, 10, 11, 14, 18 and 20, although the wording needs to be adapted. endTok	54.047389763600414
startTok I also endorse the rationale underlying the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45. endTok	46.898826725014885
startTok I can also accept the idea in the second proposed paragraph of Amendment No 47. endTok	46.31759620037072
startTok All the amendments I have listed so far pertain to the first proposal. endTok	42.54850349254462
startTok As far as the second proposal is concerned, the ideas of Amendments Nos 24, 25, 29, 30, 41 and some parts of 27, which contain sensible suggestions, can be adopted, again formulated appropriately. endTok	85.71516612160912
startTok The Commission has suggested adopting the content of these, with certain changes in the wording. endTok	71.91981342509808
startTok Moreover, I have taken note of the request made by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to codify the entire text, once it has been approved - Amendment No 7 of the first proposal and Amendment No 22 of the second proposal. endTok	20.30780716683319
startTok The Commission is in favour of codification and will, in the foreseeable future, once the proposals have been approved and subject to its right of initiative, concentrate its efforts on drafting a codified version. endTok	72.03224849393168
startTok However, I cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands. endTok	41.03287556964965
startTok The Commission is also of the opinion that a number of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would fundamentally change the content of the first proposal. endTok	14.563186001506182
startTok This is why the Commission regrets that it is unable to accept the following amendments to the first proposal: endTok	17.84814524994221
startTok Amendment No 8 because the proposed, general reference to assets 'covered by this directive' , instead of the more precise reference to assets 'mentioned in Article 19 of this Directive' , hinders implementation. endTok	81.8049994599008
startTok This Amendment could also lead to different interpretations in the Member States, which might well look for similar instruments in other articles of the directive. endTok	73.40337849282044
startTok Amendment No 16 jeopardises the protection of investors because a blocked security deposit with a third party custodian is a contradiction in terms. endTok	105.42265762922598
startTok Neither are securities lending transactions via securities clearing houses or exchanges - as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities - automatically covered by these institutions. endTok	180.6852130778057
startTok We cannot, therefore, adopt the proposed Amendment for this reason. endTok	35.000746055589886
startTok Amendment No 42 relates to a provision which was not changed by the proposal and which has not caused any problems since the implementation of the directive. endTok	43.31556375845307
startTok I therefore cannot see any reason why Article 22, paragraph 3 should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason. endTok	75.44380689993234
startTok Amendment No 44 cannot be accepted because, if it is prescribed that non-harmonised funds are subject to rules which have been 'imposed by the directive' concerning lending, borrowing, selling from an uncovered position and the third party custodian, this will indeed lead to a situation where very few funds, for example Swiss funds, would be eligible for investment. endTok	57.61678516276056
startTok This goes against the Commission' s intention to widen the scope of investments, and the wording thereof could contravene GATS agreements. endTok	51.512607418614174
startTok Amendment No 47 is unacceptable as far as the proposed changes to the first paragraph of Article 22a are concerned, because this proposal completely clashes with the spreading rules of Article 22, especially when the UCITS are obliged to indicate a point of reference in their prospectuses, as discussed in the Council. endTok	69.7709878822652
startTok The key issue regarding the first proposal, however, is Parliament' s amendment which allows the use of over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes. endTok	72.41234284926622
startTok The Commission points out that, according to the national legislation of some Member States, the use of OTC derivatives for general investment purposes is already authorised. endTok	61.403417674996895
startTok However, the Commission will be suspending its position, given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments. endTok	64.88766148074296
startTok I believe that OTC instruments could lead to problems, because they are not liquid, the price is difficult to estimate and they entail uncovered counterparty risks. endTok	56.651482879924856
startTok It seems inconsistent to opt for an extremely prudent approach with regard to investments as non-harmonised funds or deposits and, at the same time, freely to allow investments in clearly more risky OTC instruments. endTok	79.22644634587903
startTok By rejecting the rapporteur' s Amendment No 39, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has aligned itself with the Council. endTok	27.490372687797738
startTok The upshot of this amendment by Parliament would be that funds are allowed, in theory, to invest in OTC instruments and to trade the rights of participation in their funds across the entire internal market. endTok	98.77193362946394
startTok In practice, access to other EU markets for these theoretically harmonised funds which invest in OTC instruments can be blocked by applying different national legislative frameworks and protective measures against OTC investments. This would contravene the fact that EU legislation applies to all funds which invest in OTC instruments. endTok	153.83044690323365
startTok Given this possibly negative effect on the internal market and the risks inherent in OTC instruments, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 12, 15, 37, 38, 39, 43, 46 and 48 and parts of Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45 which pertain to OTC instruments. endTok	66.4486989974608
startTok As far as the second proposal is concerned, I already mentioned that the Commission will take into consideration many amendments. endTok	25.405648299138996
startTok Despite this, there are some amendments which the Commission cannot adopt: Amendment No 26, which does not seem to observe the order in which licences are granted and activities start; parts of Amendment No 27, especially the part where the prevention of conflicts of interests is deleted, the delegation of tasks is restricted to components of management decisions and the general decision-taking of Member States concerning delegation is repealed; Amendment No 31 because the Commission is of the opinion that the application of Article 44 of the directive in unchanged form has proved adequate for the trading in rights of participation in UCITS. endTok	111.93473875861766
startTok The application of the provisions of the directive concerning the performance of services in the field of investments in securities, better known as ISD, is therefore unnecessary and could lead to difficulties or confusion. endTok	52.613030621156554
startTok Amendment No 33 is ambiguous regarding 'the language' of the guest member state, especially when there are various official languages, and it is questionable what will be gained from translations in two other languages. endTok	78.08050440755234
startTok Amendment No 34 is unacceptable because a simple deletion of the reference to pension funds can create ambiguity as to whether or not a management company can carry out these activities. endTok	70.4097052204858
startTok I think that pension funds could also benefit from this possibility, provided that management companies are not lumped together with pension funds, but may only carry out part of the management per delegation. endTok	87.82963896717952
startTok Amendment No 35 cannot be accepted because legally, it cannot command any authority. endTok	152.1347201627951
startTok Management companies which are denied access to a Member State would need to re-incorporate as a different legal entity in order to be permitted in another Member State. endTok	52.078073555302055
startTok Amendments Nos 49, 50 and 51, which share the same basis, are not acceptable because they make substantial changes to the consistent approach of the Commission regarding the regulations of third party delegation, and do not offer sufficient security to the competent authorities and investors. endTok	75.88339483628965
startTok I would like to finish off by commenting on the remarks made by a few Members this morning and, Mr President, with your permission, I will do this in English. endTok	25.27214875203989
startTok First of all, regarding the remarks of Mr Crowley, who asked whether the second proposal could not simply consist in taking over a pure ISD approach; the objections of the Commission to that proposal would be the following: such an approach would pose difficulties which would arise from two different authorisations which may even involve different authorities and non-consistent sets of rules; moreover there would be no provisions whatsoever on conflicts of interest. endTok	124.26102052881184
startTok For example, a management company might be doing underwriting business and, if not able to sell, it would put the securities in the fund it would manage, or else there might be difficulties in which order business should be executed if the management company did brokering business. endTok	192.23690741245372
startTok Furthermore the proposal put forward by Mr Crowley would require a change of the ISD which at present - as I am sure he already knows - does not cover collective management business. endTok	77.64721730609399
startTok Lastly, his proposal would not give any passport to management companies which do not want to render ISD activities. endTok	69.8220751048697
startTok As regards the question put by Mr Huhne, his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations. endTok	93.74370697976626
startTok But hedging operations are already allowed in the existing Article 21(1) of Directive 611/85 on UCITS. endTok	174.75056984580596
startTok So what Mr Huhne wants is already possible. endTok	86.11303726514228
startTok A question has been put by Mrs Villiers who referred to enhancing portfolio management. endTok	61.78626363135485
startTok That is also something which is allowed under present legislation. I refer to the same Article 21 I referred to in relation to Mr Huhne' s question. endTok	59.51502772708195
startTok In her question Mrs Kauppi asks why the Commission has prepared a package of measures distributed in two separate proposals. The reason is that the first proposal focuses essentially on the product, while the second proposal focuses essentially on the service provider, and on prospectuses for UCITS. endTok	66.32258495418176
startTok The separation of these two proposals which deal with two different sets of problems would facilitate the negotiating process in the Council. endTok	79.47238502321476
startTok The Commission has not only to listen to Parliament and take into account parliamentary proposals but, as is well-known, must also deal with the Council. endTok	54.55160731016165
startTok That is the reason why the Commission has put forward these two separate proposals. endTok	20.46680024994042
startTok Lastly, Mr Balfe has complained that there are, in his opinion, too many limits in the whole proposal the Commission has put forward. endTok	43.18904404548352
startTok It seems to us that these limits are justified: firstly, by the need to diversify investments; secondly, because of the vulnerability to the need to reimburse investment at any time; thirdly, in order to avoid an inordinate influence over the investment funds. endTok	52.7467805862102
startTok These are the reasons why the Commission believes, because of the prudence that has to be exercised in this field, that these various limits are necessary. endTok	32.02850878501306
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place at 12 noon. endTok	11.028587451198293
startTok Mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States endTok	27.73887142831559
startTok The next item is the report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr Di Pietro on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the draft Council Act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union. endTok	7.464778301194316
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in letters dated 3 August 1999 and 3 December 1999, the Council called on the European Parliament, pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty, to deliver its opinion on a draft convention between the Member States aimed at guaranteeing improved mutual assistance in criminal matters. endTok	41.663659673042346
startTok It is thus, as you can see, a very important draft, that will effectively serve to provide the Member States of the Union with a more comprehensive and consistent instrument for mutual assistance. endTok	40.791313423294866
startTok In actual fact, there are still certain differences of opinion within the Council over the type of convention, and over certain provisions contained therein. endTok	97.26115990115319
startTok Some of these differences have already been ironed out, but others persist. endTok	49.25701584697746
startTok The spirit of the proposal is nevertheless to equip those responsible for applying the law - primarily the judiciary, but also the citizens concerned - with a valid operational instrument to fight crime, which respects fundamental guarantees as regards defence and general principles of human rights. endTok	88.72048404948565
startTok It is for this reason that, despite the many omissions in the text, the provisions set out therein could - and I say could, Mr President - be accepted on condition that they are suitably amended in order to ensure they can be implemented by those responsible for applying the law and are acceptable to the citizens. endTok	55.35622820985578
startTok The Commission has proposed various amendments to this end, all of which aim to systematically restructure the Council proposal by suggesting a series of technical adjustments that will render the text harmonious and consistent as regards the amendments proposed. endTok	93.5747128609872
startTok The amendments can be summarised as follows: they place greater emphasis on fundamental rights of defence, introduce a range of technical modifications needed to make a whole series of obscure and inconsistent passages more comprehensible, and delete the section relating to the remote interception of telecommunications, an area which still requires not only increased technical awareness but also acceptance on the part of the governments of the various Member States of the Union. endTok	60.66695382489676
startTok The proposal, as formulated by the Council and subsequently amended by the Commission, provides for a convention based on three titles: the first lays down guidelines for ensuring the consistency of procedures and formalities for letters rogatory; the second lists a whole series of specific requests for mutual assistance and defines the formalities and procedures which must be followed in relation to these specific types of mutual assistance; the third and last provides for and codifies the procedures via which telephone conversations conducted by citizens in a State other than the one instigating proceedings can and must be intercepted. endTok	80.09286846138933
startTok Mr President, international cooperation is certainly needed in order to tackle both cross-border crime and crimes which are committed in one State, but the evidence for which is to be found in another. endTok	66.44980798902279
startTok It is nevertheless necessary to reach agreement as soon as possible on a new convention which will also take other, even more delicate issues into account: the whole issue of double jeopardy, that of specialities, and that of the credibility of one Member State of the Union in respect of the judicial authorities of other Member States of the Union. endTok	40.19531238428549
startTok These are thus extremely important questions, which we hope that the Council will see fit to take up when formulating a new opinion. endTok	62.29414301368039
startTok As regards other aspects of this subject, Mr President, I would refer you to my written report. endTok	58.01570605878953
startTok - (ES) Mr President, I want to start by saying that I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party which I represent on this issue. endTok	8.372158906605511
startTok I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Council is not present today. endTok	9.218427955339868
startTok By contrast, I welcome the attentive presence of Commissioner Vitorino, as has consistently been the case since his appointment. This leads me to another point. endTok	92.32780346638435
startTok This House has only prepared one report on this Convention. It was in fact consulted on a text which was not the text being worked on by the Council and which did not contain points which had already been agreed. endTok	60.98149336942762
startTok I condemn this, as well as the Council' s absence. endTok	34.40881128439172
startTok These are serious matters on which this House must act. endTok	51.52333033871455
startTok We are about to advance into new territory where attitudes and symbols are of great significance. endTok	46.89385119848691
startTok A political community is reflected in the justice which it hands out. endTok	112.70882680814704
startTok This is why this report is so important. endTok	14.782305638911243
startTok It represents a step towards the area of freedom, security and, particularly, justice to which we all aspire. endTok	35.55551323514119
startTok It is also an important step towards European natural justice. This will be built on mutual confidence between the Member States and their respective legal systems and on the confidence of the European people in any European court. endTok	34.231732237791164
startTok It will also be built on scrupulous respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and on the guarantee of fair trials in particular. endTok	38.7368633117254
startTok It is in this respect that this House has significantly - and in my opinion rightly - altered the balance proposed by the Council by firmly and decidedly supporting a reinforcement of these guarantees of fair trials in all the amendments. endTok	59.557554620881994
startTok Mr President, as the rapporteur said, this House has concentrated on the particular issue of phone tapping in order to remove this from the Convention. endTok	30.527028764007
startTok On behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have tabled an amendment to the motion for a resolution which asks the Council to produce a text on this issue as soon as possible. endTok	11.949179134025751
startTok The regulation of phone tapping in the Council document was incomplete and therefore inadequate. endTok	30.25755579472242
startTok Yet a lack of regulation is also inappropriate and may lead to abuses in the telecommunications field. In fact, we are aware that these are already happening widely. endTok	71.07971911071508
startTok The other point which I must highlight and on which we have also worked extensively is the use of video conferencing with regard to accused persons. endTok	64.80698700072286
startTok Again on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have asked the Council to produce a convention as soon as possible in order to clarify and supplement the regulation of this issue, which is frankly unsatisfactory. endTok	23.959728347314222
startTok Apart from a few exceptions, the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party will vote in favour of the committee' s amendments, and of course our own. endTok	21.398796956154282
startTok Mr President, it is our opinion that one facet of the construction of Europe hinges on the construction of a common judicial system, for the Europe that we want to build, which comprises administrative law, civil law, both substantive and procedural, and criminal law, both substantive and procedural. endTok	55.79182906552258
startTok The Convention on Mutual Assistance and Criminal Matters, which we are examining today, is but a stitch in the great fabric of the corpus iuris of Europe, which has its natural foundation in fundamental human rights and freedoms. endTok	49.312066232157775
startTok Thus it is that legal cooperation and cooperation on criminal matters must also strictly respect fundamental rights, principles which lie at very root of our culture and our civilisation: I am thinking of fair trials, and more particularly of the rights of the defence, of the impartiality and integrity of judges, of the length of legal proceedings, for which my country, Italy, unfortunately has the worst record in terms of the number of sentences handed down, of the cases pending before the European Court of Human Rights. endTok	71.15730964528608
startTok Restrictions on fundamental rights cannot and must not be applied to the field of law unless they are justified in that they are associated with an actual or presumed violation of criminal law. endTok	54.240093229983096
startTok The report that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has substantially amended with regard to its original formula, taking up many of the amendments we have presented, still leaves room for a certain confusion, in relation to the way in which the interception of telecommunications and video conferences are to be regulated. endTok	43.95498014986135
startTok The news received in recent weeks on the way in which modern technologies facilitate interceptions mean that greater attention must be paid to this issue: we would not want our reality to be even more harsh and troubled than the dark scenes depicted by Orwell. endTok	52.28106622538745
startTok This is only the beginning of a great project in the field of law, which should advance hand in hand with the growth the type of Europe we want to see. endTok	48.371349235953794
startTok Mr President, committee amendments and political group amendments may be tabled in plenary, but not amendments from individual Members. endTok	225.12794654772318
startTok Mr Schulz should be aware of this. endTok	29.97635022126494
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully understand the frustration of Mr Di Pietro who, in a short space of time, has had to carry out an extraordinary amount of work in order to be able to submit this report to us today. endTok	21.46902696058531
startTok Crime in the European Union has increased to such an extent that we cannot and must not content ourselves any longer with a step-by-step approach of mutual legal assistance in criminal affairs. endTok	126.7406131752212
startTok The European Parliament is certainly not to blame for this. endTok	12.346429816997516
startTok It is the governments of the Member States who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree. endTok	29.88255815852265
startTok As a result, the European Parliament is faced with an almost impossible task. endTok	44.642476295692965
startTok One has to content oneself with the idea that all means, however slight, must be seized upon in order to set up better legal assistance. endTok	65.97983562416981
startTok By way of paradox, I could say that it would be best if as little as possible was said about this report, for the clearer we make it that only very small steps are being taken, the more the world of crime will gloat and the more the acute imbalance between organised crime and the desperate lack of judicial cooperation will become obvious. endTok	87.65826411630316
startTok I would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council of Ministers to finally face reality, that is to say the fact that crime is developing faster than the law. endTok	39.23379520366885
startTok The goal is, after all, to provide the judicial bodies - magistrates, in the first place, but also the citizens involved - with the instruments to fight crime without prejudice to the fundamental guarantees of defence and the general principles of human rights. endTok	56.03623821194299
startTok If not, we will be fighting a running battle. endTok	62.360061697752364
startTok I therefore advocate further harmonisation of criminal law in the EU Member States in the first instance. endTok	34.63180178124077
startTok In my opinion, this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all Member States. endTok	19.72542319748492
startTok As long as this harmonisation has not been achieved, however, we need to be consistent if we want to bring about mutual legal assistance. endTok	39.89261904405971
startTok To this end, I had submitted an amendment stipulating that legal assistance can only be granted in the event of criminal prosecution instituted by the authorities based on facts which are punishable according to the national law of the petitioning party and the Member State petitioned. endTok	44.0309185831098
startTok The content of my amendment is, in fact, echoed in Amendment No 43, which also stipulates this condition of accrual. endTok	49.26783306307357
startTok This condition of accrual is essential since, in my opinion, the principle of nulla poena sine lege, legality in criminal law, must be observed. endTok	36.17555717540427
startTok As such, any request for legal assistance concerning a hypothetical action which is not a crime in the petitioned Member State contravenes this principle of legality and thus the fundamental principles of justice in the petitioned Member State. endTok	72.64987604402779
startTok Hence, it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted. endTok	44.36699013661009
startTok Finally, I would like to reiterate that Mr Di Pietro has, in my opinion, delivered sterling work by submitting a report which, within the limitations, offers all possible guarantees for safeguarding individual human rights and fundamental freedoms. endTok	63.567539016888446
startTok If, however, we would like to give European citizens a greater sense of security, we need to step up our efforts in the field of judicial cooperation. endTok	51.56377323942825
startTok Mr President, my Group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day-to-day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs. endTok	40.1926578952738
startTok The aim of regulations is to define the reciprocal rights and duties of States or citizens or those applicable in the relationship between citizens and government. endTok	82.93569495550922
startTok The present proposal is complex, because it deals with agreements between Member States but has far-reaching consequences for the citizen-government relationship. endTok	77.86478470999518
startTok It is precisely in the field of legal protection that the Council' s proposal leaves a great deal to be desired. endTok	23.916997425725977
startTok In the words of rapporteur Mr Di Pietro, the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings. endTok	94.73861815473484
startTok Thanks to the agreement, it is possible to create a chain of legal assistance requests, whereby each link represents authorities and criminal law systems of different Member States. endTok	131.3598071916888
startTok The chain is arranged in such a way as to ensure that it cannot fall as a whole within the competence of one court. endTok	38.51366586755536
startTok Additional measures are hence required, such as the obligation on the part of criminal investigators to give evidence in every criminal case in which their material is used. endTok	139.2544258653874
startTok The fact that the Council' s proposal rides roughshod over the principle of proportionality is also hard to deal with for my Group. endTok	25.569750123777258
startTok There are certainly no restrictions in its scope. endTok	87.51605496183365
startTok As such, the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime. endTok	150.68578884624702
startTok In fact, it is not written anywhere that it is restricted to criminal law. endTok	34.25757307348455
startTok It is, therefore, conceivable that the European Union will soon be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the rights of the citizen will vanish in the dust. endTok	20.625548054903938
startTok Mr President, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters that we are examining today contains the minimum requirements for efficient and rapid cooperation between the various judicial or investigative bodies concerned. endTok	66.97561091904171
startTok It pertains, among other things, to notifications, information exchanges, the temporary transfer of detainees, the restitution of property, testimonies via video conferences, investigative activities and 'undercover' activities, and the interception of telephone calls. endTok	98.76397436651276
startTok This is the bare minimum on which an agreement can be reached, and it should immediately be said that if any amendments, such as Amendments Nos 32 or 81, or the revised Amendments Nos 70 or 71, were to be passed, the whole convention would be reduced to an exchange of notifications or information and at this point should simply be scrapped, and we would vote against it. endTok	76.35979936053232
startTok I hope that the common sense of our fellow MEPs in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments. endTok	41.464930923286545
startTok The fact that the convention has not been turned into a framework agreement also constitutes a defeat for this Parliament. endTok	32.365405481554596
startTok As Commissioner Vitorino will have noted in all the various speeches, the need has emerged to draw up a framework of common rules, which is to say that we cannot continue in this manner, with this disparate agenda, with these piecemeal agreements which relate to diverse sectors such as that of investigation. endTok	71.93435556783386
startTok What is, on the other hand, absolutely necessary is to have a bare minimum of set rules that are valid within the Community, and which clearly provide as many additional safeguards as possible, and will also provide guarantees with a view to enlargement. endTok	78.50613877312465
startTok My thoughts turn to what may become of this Community, of these conventions and judicial relations if, for example, a fascist country such as Turkey became a member of the Union. It would truly perplex me. endTok	126.5443527290443
startTok We need a corpus iuris - as everyone has said - and common rules, especially procedural ones, which guarantee the rule of common law throughout the Community. endTok	88.95253500358046
startTok It is clear that this is primarily an issue for the IGC and one that addresses an aspiration to which this Parliament can only make a limited contribution in as much as everything depends on the Council and the Commission. endTok	35.109062285550536
startTok I believe that this first half of the year, in which we have a Commissioner from Portugal and Portuguese Presidency of the Council, provides an excellent opportunity to give an initial spur to this shared aspiration. endTok	37.009683337397725
startTok It is precisely for this reason that we are in favour of adopting Amendments Nos 78 and 79, which already prefigure a minimum of set rules on interceptions and on video conferences. endTok	37.4578533635323
startTok On the one hand, we eagerly await the successful outcome of this vote, precisely so that this convention - which, I repeat, already sets minimum rules - is not stripped of all meaning, while on the other hand we are also looking forward to any form of proposal that may arrive from the Commission with a view to definitively putting into effect this minimum Community law. endTok	65.79572777241145
startTok Mr President, confronted with the burgeoning phenomenon of organised crime at international level, the Member States must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible. endTok	33.408497431897636
startTok Indeed, they must set in place the institutional conditions needed to launch a tangible and efficient cooperation process in the field of law - a process that must nevertheless cover all the stages needed to prevent the untimely impositions that are detrimental to legitimate national prescriptions in the field of justice, over which Member States have sovereign powers, and above all to prevent impositions that result in riding roughshod over basic civil rights. endTok	86.79550713085438
startTok We must therefore proceed with caution with regard to a document like the one from the Council which, as the rapporteur himself has underlined, now claims, after years of discussion, to have found a universal solution in the space of a few months. endTok	61.24831579217229
startTok Furthermore - and I agree with the assessment made by Mr Di Pietro - the Council' s text would appear to be overladen with contradictions, inconsistent propositions and omissions. endTok	55.89005617744063
startTok It is clear that the justice sector, more than any other, cannot be handled in an inconsistent or contradictory manner. endTok	53.319526970426885
startTok It is the opinion of our Group that even the report, considered as a whole, would be the subject of much debate, notwithstanding the incorporation of certain corrective amendments that take into account the safeguarding of personal liberty and respect for national sovereignties. endTok	84.18737003651647
startTok The report contains arguments that are too disparate, which do not link together smoothly, and everything thus hinges on approximations. endTok	77.70636887573298
startTok We will, in conclusion, vote against this report, while stressing that the Europe to which we aspire is a Europe of rights and guarantees: rights and guarantees that call for gradual and responsible discussion, as well as very serious examination. endTok	126.84097438255554
startTok We must first establish general rules and institutional certainties. Only then will we be able to institute actual conventions. endTok	191.29369723710187
startTok Mr President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament on the Bonino List, I intend to confirm the position that we adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties and am thus also announcing our vote on their behalf. It is a vote against this report, or more precisely a vote against the convention on which the report is based. endTok	50.204111500058715
startTok I would nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work. He listened very closely to our arguments at the committee stage, and particularly those on the issue of respecting the rights of the defence, both at national level and at the level of cooperation on criminal law as part of European mutual assistance. endTok	39.85877374561608
startTok The committee and the rapporteur have incorporated nine of the eleven amendments that we presented, and these centred precisely on the rights of the defence. endTok	73.1163690852042
startTok This spurs us to maintain that the European Parliament would have done sterling work in guaranteeing that civil rights and freedoms were safeguarded, if this were a lawmaking parliament and if we were, as part of this procedure, in fact co-legislators - which we are not. endTok	78.42199338561798
startTok This is the problem, and it is for this reason that we are critical of the position adopted by the Council, which is one we find completely unsatisfactory. endTok	30.06392043441278
startTok This is a task that has lasted three years, and on which we have been consulted, so to speak, as a matter of course, when this issue, as has already been stressed, comprises highly important formal and substantive facets, which called for a range of assessments, consultations, concerted actions and codecisions. endTok	70.03391106159489
startTok It would seem to us that the Council has taken the various issues - those of legitimate interceptions, the rights of the defence, the rights of detainees and of the authorities legally empowered to request mutual assistance - a little too lightly. endTok	79.91993446488814
startTok We should have requested and rejected the first version of the convention, and then requested another: the majority on the committee did not want this and it is for this reason that we will vote against it, even if we hope that the amendments, which nevertheless improve the text, can be incorporated by the Council - we doubt that they will be, but hope all the same that they are. endTok	70.82114293497999
startTok In my Group, there are undoubtedly different views of Mr Di Pietro' s report. endTok	36.53837803041216
startTok I agree that it is - as has been said - a good and competent piece of work, which has been carried out under difficult conditions. endTok	38.7094248667729
startTok The Danish Members of the Group cannot vote in favour of the proposal but will, on the contrary, be supporting a number of amendments, especially those tabled by the Greens. endTok	65.35512078390833
startTok There are two reasons why we are saying no. endTok	33.03942828887074
startTok Firstly, these are immensely complicated and very sensitive legal questions which are at issue and, to my mind, the proposal entails some risks to legal certainty, which have not been fully realised. This is in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support. endTok	111.70556945942504
startTok The other main reason, however, is that, even though we are concerned here with a Convention (and therefore with international cooperation), there is no doubt about the trend expressed in the proposal. And the trend is towards creating, in the longer term, a common European area of jurisdiction, common EU criminal law and common EU administration of justice. endTok	100.69448830901419
startTok We would warn against that trend. We have this AFSJ mantra - Area of Freedom, Security and Justice - the full enormity of which lies in its establishment of EU systems which will play havoc with existing legal traditions relating to these sensitive and important questions which are overwhelmingly national in character. endTok	102.78784067634362
startTok Mr President, I too agree that the convention that we are examining is but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom, security and justice which Europe will hopefully one day become. endTok	55.226933914558366
startTok It is today an area for the free movement of goods and persons, in which there are no frontiers to crime, but in which significant barriers still exist to those whose duty it is to combat crime. endTok	66.70078821526835
startTok A small step - I say - but nonetheless a welcome one, for which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has quite correctly wanted to prescribe further restrictions and guarantees in the name of the defence of the fundamental rights of the individual that are in force in the Member States and in the Union itself, even if these are not yet enshrined in a European Union charter of rights, which we hope will soon come into being: just restrictions and guarantees because, unfortunately, existing rights are, in practice, not always respected by every public authority in every Member State. endTok	65.44278082151286
startTok Certain isolated passages in the Commission' s proposal perhaps err on the side of caution, as is the case when it is maintained that the detainee accused should be given the choice of whether to accept or refuse temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purposes of preliminary enquiries. endTok	54.08573892049845
startTok I personally find it unacceptable, for example, for Mr Pinochet to be given the option to move to Spain for a confrontation. endTok	72.67069896601515
startTok Or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link. endTok	172.40618432185173
startTok These are nevertheless minor flaws, which the rapporteur did not want and which - I hope - will be remedied when this Chamber comes to vote. endTok	56.57710946134621
startTok The rapporteur has made laudable efforts, which should not go unnoted and for which I would like to thank him. endTok	31.421851758157736
startTok The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account. endTok	46.918174799252704
startTok There is, as has already been said, one point still to resolved, which is also the most delicate one: it concerns article 18 of the convention, which relates to the interception of communications originating in one Member State, but which are directly performed by another Member State, without the assistance being requested of the State in which the interception is being carried out, something which is now possible thanks to the latest technology. endTok	72.18801152967731
startTok This is a highly controversial issue as it constitutes a potential source of abuse. endTok	35.30148488718363
startTok It could be maintained that in overall terms the legislation proposed is better than nothing, but to the Commission it nevertheless appeared insufficient and far from reassuring. endTok	107.90734945814812
startTok It thus merits further reflection which, at a time in which the ambivalent reports on ECHELON are evoking shades of Big Brother, should probably go into greater detail on the means and methods to be used, on the one hand, to safeguard the rights of the individual, and on the other hand to facilitate an effective but at the same time correct and legitimate suppression of crime. endTok	57.04518916934711
startTok The objective is thus to achieve, as closely as possible, a fine balance between the fight against organised crime and respect for personal freedoms and the dignity of the individual: an objective which now specifically applies not only to the Member States, but also to the Union, which is aspiring to become a common area of freedom, justice and security. endTok	51.60469081024526
startTok This is a distant goal, but is one that can be attained in stages. endTok	66.88506843823399
startTok The most important thing will be the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States, but for now let us content ourselves with this small step forward, as it is a step in the right direction. endTok	32.562216982026115
startTok Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory statement. endTok	6.0444857721292635
startTok It points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal. endTok	35.6881127615796
startTok The lack of clarity of language is inevitably going to lead to legal uncertainty. endTok	53.58649171885918
startTok Legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters. endTok	64.92610139563232
startTok Because of shoddy drafting the Convention can be interpreted very widely, and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the European Convention on Human Rights. endTok	71.1641639261487
startTok Article 18 allows interception in another Member State without its involvement. endTok	177.9274673372196
startTok Not only should this be deleted, the whole interception title should be scrapped. endTok	99.56403361163733
startTok An initiative of the FBI drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation. endTok	52.98342070750863
startTok The Council proposal containing those requirements, ENFOPOL 98 was approved by this Parliament last May in the Schmid report. endTok	112.78167312944042
startTok Now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception, and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at. endTok	44.32126423474791
startTok The requirements propose to allow the authorities access to the facilities of all service providers, that is, telephones, mobile phones, Internet, etc.; and given the current extremely shoddy drafting, this is open to abuse. I would also like to ask: given that the user requirements specify that the police has access to all service providers without exception, does this include Parliament' s in-house service? endTok	107.86655396421752
startTok Are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very, very shoddy grounds? endTok	140.91956386770545
startTok Furthermore, in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences. endTok	60.647256879524235
startTok This leaves it wide open to abuse. endTok	116.09151420353456
startTok Again as regards the reversal of the burden of proof, something which is recognised in international, fundamental law, the presumption of innocence is essential. endTok	59.02116557678911
startTok That is not guaranteed. endTok	44.22901524511474
startTok Neither the preamble nor the body of the text takes proper account of the rights of the defence, a basic principle of international fundamental rights. endTok	94.13789769535173
startTok This issue is extremely serious. endTok	25.126821028876577
startTok We are very concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate within the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberties organisations throughout Europe which are extremely concerned about these developments. endTok	65.28550690393048
startTok Mr President, I am neither a member of the Legal Affairs Committee nor a lawyer, but like almost all of us, I understand the need for this Single Economic Area of Europe to have its parallel in a single area of freedom, security and justice. endTok	44.27234484841273
startTok In that sense, the issues of judicial cooperation in matters of criminal law are important. endTok	60.975270943122744
startTok What did I understand on reading the related texts? endTok	169.81398569315226
startTok That it is dangerous to rely on the provisions made by the Council. endTok	26.38249670291238
startTok The many contradictions and conflicting views over what Europe is and the many different legal systems could not only lead to confusion and inefficiency but also create dangerous situations. endTok	92.67404991236089
startTok For example, the situation proposed by Article 18, to which many speakers have drawn attention, where each country, each large country if you will, each country with the technical ability, can enter another country and monitor its telecommunications without even securing the second country' s approval. endTok	177.21985000582933
startTok In my opinion, the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur Mr Di Pietro have produced some very interesting work. endTok	25.23370616164259
startTok It is a pity that this very well constructed explanatory statement by Mr Di Pietro could not be conveyed in the telegrammatic five minutes he had here today. endTok	33.03195365884858
startTok Nevertheless, it is a move towards protecting the rights of countries, defendants and citizens, a path which I think must be pursued much more completely and much more boldly. endTok	75.28805479991692
startTok I should like, however, to draw your attention to the fact that all this is taking place in a framework in which there is confusion and a schizophrenic attitude about criminal law. endTok	23.206431156201116
startTok A child, a student or a pupil who smokes hashish in one country is dealt with in an educational way, while in another country he is treated as a criminal and locked up in the universities of crime constituted by the corrective system and the prisons. endTok	55.32983859558171
startTok How can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis? endTok	51.26721861935078
startTok For that reason, in conclusion, I believe we should do something, particularly in the area of harmonisation of laws, not those relating to organised criminal activity, but those concerning punishable activities by the people which are more in the nature of social phenomena. endTok	63.8799657315155
startTok On behalf of the TDI Group, I should like to take the opportunity afforded by Judge Di Pietro' s report on mutual assistance in criminal matters to refer to a case which is a tragic illustration of the way crime is eroding security in Europe. endTok	36.455921717017496
startTok On 14 December 1999, a five year-old boy called Clément was found in a sleeping-car on the Calais-Ventimiglia train, crying for his mother who was taking him to visit his sick grandmother. endTok	69.90935926701862
startTok Corinne Caillaux, who had probably been raped, was found with her throat cut and covered in stab wounds in the lavatories on the train. endTok	78.47649613268473
startTok The presumed killer, Sid Ahmed Rezala, is also strongly suspected of having murdered the British student Isabel Peake, who was raped and thrown out of the train taking her to see her parents, and another young woman, Émilie Bazin, who was found dead in Amiens under a pile of coal in the building where he lived. endTok	51.780523968388515
startTok Rezala should never have been in France. He arrived from Algeria at a time when, according to the authorities, immigration had been stopped and there was no reason for him to come. endTok	59.643666556816626
startTok He should never have stayed in France, having been reported to the transport police more than 40 times for offences, which should have been enough for him to be expelled back to his home country. endTok	62.79927945117517
startTok He should never have been free because 14 charges of theft, violence and rape had been brought against him, one of which was for the rape of a minor. endTok	71.27827260409894
startTok He should never have been able to escape from France, but the officers pursuing him had no jurisdiction and European frontiers have more holes than a sieve. endTok	89.34067872484877
startTok He should never have arrived in Spain, where he mugged a woman at knifepoint and yet was immediately released by the Spanish authorities. endTok	68.25878741064696
startTok Today, thanks to the complex networks of sexual deviants, he is in Portugal. endTok	129.83598144276547
startTok Portugal refuses to extradite him on the grounds that he would face a longer prison sentence in France than that provided for in the Portuguese penal code. endTok	101.46866411537083
startTok I should like to ask the Portuguese minister, the President-in-Office of the Council, to put a stop to this scandal at once. endTok	19.9933165376094
startTok I should like to ask the House to wake up, at long last, to the appalling situation of the victims of policies for which the establishment, not the yobs, bears full responsibility. endTok	30.785892550635758
startTok Mr President, this agreement deals with a sensitive issue: cooperation in the field of criminal law. endTok	25.98896001497232
startTok It is therefore understandable that the Council finds it difficult to agree. endTok	27.600487168902045
startTok Successful application of this agreement by the Member States requires unanimity within the Council. endTok	68.23558439861861
startTok Only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice. endTok	96.24710068347167
startTok This, however, does not mean that the Council can work on this anonymously. endTok	21.881966317988425
startTok Quite the reverse, in fact. endTok	98.41074073721177
startTok The Council' s proposal must comply with legislation of the national Member States in the field of criminal law. endTok	24.700155044547962
startTok The wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromises which do not stand this test. endTok	41.7343857760016
startTok Careful parliamentary scrutiny by the European Parliament but, above all, by the national parliaments, is therefore of key importance. endTok	50.38455342871129
startTok Mr Di Pietro' s proposal to omit the current Article 18 regarding intercepting telecommunications, amongst other things, is understandable, although very strict. endTok	118.07672772738351
startTok The text of Article 18 is ambiguous: he is restricting the activities of the intelligence services but seems to allow interception activities by a Member State in another Member State without the latter' s prior authorisation. endTok	92.18254622017656
startTok In this way, Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State. endTok	92.76711746887662
startTok Proposed additions, such as repeated references to the ECHR, the rights of the counsel for the defence and of the defendant and the failure of Member States to implement the ECHR, add too much unnecessary information to the text of the agreement. endTok	42.00173608384748
startTok I am aware of the problems but I think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text. endTok	26.6587083289509
startTok The Dutch Members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will, however, despite hesitation, not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the final vote. endTok	48.41482370455608
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is very important not only in terms of its content but also because it represents an initial step towards the establishment of better relations in judicial cooperation. endTok	24.35696116132969
startTok This clearly only applies to relations at national level as nothing is mentioned about the much-discussed European citizenship. endTok	121.87206413812481
startTok On one hand judicial measures fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting. endTok	90.58619966630037
startTok Pursuant to Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the Union' s objective is 'to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia' . endTok	42.67722677791221
startTok The creation of Europol represents one step towards achieving this objective. However, we must take the next step, which is to reinforce judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to gradually establish a genuine European judicial area consistent with the objective of creating an area of freedom, security and justice. endTok	44.458986306583576
startTok This draft convention therefore aims to complete and facilitate the application, at Member State level, of pre-existing conventions on other legal areas. The intention is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the national law of the Member States and in the European Convention on Human Rights. endTok	64.6294184197221
startTok It is this concern for basic rights, freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals. We recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue. endTok	57.21334995424827
startTok As for videoconferencing, more precise regulations must be established so that the rights of the defence and guarantees of fair trials are safeguarded. endTok	45.744027090451354
startTok The procedural aspect of the legal system must be respected by defending the rights... endTok	54.23347252895623
startTok (The President cut the speaker off) endTok	8.491221292876252
startTok Mr President, legislating in criminal matters is often countered, wrongly, with arguments of individual freedom and security. endTok	70.05866095926265
startTok Is one secure when freedoms are no longer guaranteed? endTok	141.29838383194394
startTok Is one free when security is no longer assured? endTok	187.36461762057442
startTok Modern criminal law revolves around the quest for a balance, a dialogue between security and freedom. endTok	100.70625264023016
startTok And this dialogue is open-ended; it adapts to the demands of the day. endTok	61.74664996408355
startTok Nowadays, certain forms of crime are cross-border crimes and it is, of course, in the interests of the Member States to improve cooperation so that they can crack down on them. endTok	48.6409811772075
startTok But the Council' s draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts. endTok	44.44772009550308
startTok First, the form: the draft convention is vague in the extreme, and this is totally incompatible with the objective of legal certainty in a modern society. endTok	53.719117297235336
startTok It is not just a question of style. endTok	15.533305189989052
startTok We are taking about criminal law here and criminal law has to be interpreted by the letter. endTok	57.9389338486752
startTok Then the content: the Council draft fudges the obvious difficulty caused by widely differing legal systems, varying practices and a total lack of legal public service standards in certain Member States of the Union. endTok	110.74946987736392
startTok It makes provision in article 9 for prisoners held in custody to be transferred from one state to another despite the fact that guarantees differ. endTok	72.92131821674091
startTok I should like to stress this point because it is paramount. endTok	13.9395895611751
startTok We must not forget that several tens of thousands of people are currently held in custody in the European Union without having stood trial and that, in some states, custody is abused and used as a means of extorting confessions. endTok	23.960282460827237
startTok It is nothing less than legal torture. endTok	43.230210746326776
startTok Other European countries, on the other hand, do not accept confession as sufficient proof of guilt. endTok	60.751512140590556
startTok It is this diversity in our criminal policies which we have to address and legislating properly means looking for genuine legal convergence criteria and facing up to the reality of prisons in Europe, which are often overcrowded places outside the law which are a disgrace to the conception we have of ourselves. endTok	62.5196483374945
startTok Mr President, as you know, all of our countries abolished the death penalty years ago, but with nearly a thousand suicides a year in our prisons, they have not really abolished it? endTok	65.43207819324795
startTok Mr President, co-operation in the field of law is without doubt essential in free market Europe, but it must hinge on the strictest respect for those principles which lie at the very heart of our civilisation: the fundamental human rights and freedoms, laid down in the European Convention on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. endTok	46.78047422799976
startTok We can but thank the parliamentary committees, which have - via the introduction of numerous amendments - made far-reaching modifications aimed at providing guarantees to a report which, in its initial format, we did not find at all convincing. endTok	79.5513223943853
startTok I turn to Mr Schulz in confirming that we always submit amendments not on a personal basis or for personal motives, but in connection with general political concerns. endTok	123.8682076333685
startTok If it is then a question of listing the areas investigated or researching these, they can be found with the rapporteurs, among them the author of the report on this convention. endTok	70.76922348093292
startTok I thus believe that Mr Schulz could have spared himself the effort of making certain remarks. endTok	102.51241385006986
startTok As I have said, numerous amendments have been incorporated which guarantee the rights of the defence - I am thinking here of the obligation for interceptions to be requested by a judge - or the prohibition on holding both an investigative and a judicial mandate as part of a joint investigation team. endTok	77.13750725934585
startTok In brief, this Parliament wanted the convention to apply solely to criminal matters; the restrictions on freedom and on fundamental rights set out in the convention can but be limited to criminal matters. endTok	113.25170589056296
startTok We need hard and fast rules. endTok	62.136909720984555
startTok The Council has behaved in an unseemly manner, changing tack in mid-course, and is nowhere to be seen. endTok	64.27316504774828
startTok We would, on the other hand, like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for attending the debate held in this Chamber. endTok	32.103966744352334
startTok As I have said, we need hard and fast rules if we are to have fair trials in Europe - without intrusion from interceptions, without the illicit use of video conferences - because we in Europe should no longer have trials run by magistrates who play politics rather than administer justice, and because punishment should be meted out to the real perpetrators of crime and not to innocent people who someone finds inconvenient. endTok	63.20035085244234
startTok . Mr President, the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is approaching adoption by the Council. endTok	18.187402414332322
startTok Most say it is about time. endTok	117.38913386787121
startTok According to the action plan to combat organised crime adopted by the Council in April 1997, the work on the draft MLA Convention should have been finalised before the end of 1997. endTok	41.422986040717525
startTok More time will pass before the Convention actually enters into force, given the fact that this requires Member States' ratification. endTok	110.29034814340793
startTok Even with the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, foreseeing its entry into force once at least half of the Member States have adopted the Convention, I would like to urge the Member States to do everything in their power to speedily ratify this Convention. endTok	40.126830959238546
startTok Past experience with ratification of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing. endTok	83.2512049170496
startTok This Convention will not create a new or different system of Mutual Assistance. endTok	55.82062160629884
startTok Instead it aims at building on tried and tested mechanisms that have been in place for a very long time, such as the ones foreseen by the Council of Europe Convention on mutual assistance of 1959 and the Benelux Treaty. endTok	54.59350308574368
startTok The draft that the Council has elaborated contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several Members of Parliament. endTok	44.80272582748917
startTok It is a considerable achievement of the Convention that where at all possible requested Member States shall comply with the formalities and procedures indicated by the requesting Member States. endTok	46.653220778392004
startTok This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using evidence that is obtained in court. endTok	45.066700051250095
startTok Furthermore, requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities. endTok	161.9564513579676
startTok Generally speaking, there are two kinds of provisions: those that create an obligation to render assistance, such as the provisions on telephone and video conferences, controlled deliveries and on the interception of telecommunications; and those where no such obligation is created and only a legal framework is provided for Member States that wish to cooperate in the manner prescribed, for example, the provisions on joint investigation teams, covert investigations and the sending and service of procedural documents. endTok	100.41250839707614
startTok The Commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions that deal with new or modern investigative techniques, given their effectiveness in fighting the form of crime that is best placed to take advantage of the opening of borders - organised crime. endTok	96.81561233073657
startTok It is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations. endTok	56.22552215917226
startTok However, one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence. endTok	78.60356668762996
startTok I very much appreciate that the report of Mr Di Pietro, whom I salute for the excellent work he has done in such a short period of time, includes the right of defence as one of its main points. endTok	26.01695735376182
startTok At the present time it is entirely up to the Member States to ensure that those rights are respected under the scrutiny of the Council of Europe' s Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. endTok	34.44083701599011
startTok It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights, work on which has just begun. endTok	54.23808883089596
startTok We must recognise that Article 18 concerns what is clearly a controversial decision. endTok	92.6651238752696
startTok The article was carefully crafted in Council in very lengthy discussions, in order to ensure that intelligence activities would remain effective and that criminal investigations will be covered. endTok	107.02483325319366
startTok As far as criminal investigations are concerned, for which I am responsible, I take note of the invitation that was addressed to the Commission and the Council by several Members of the European Parliament to take this issue on board and to address it on a common legal basis, having regard to the relevance the interception of telecommunications may have as evidence before the courts. endTok	44.41441510139948
startTok The Commission is fully aware of the fact that the draft we have before us is not perfect or ideal. endTok	32.0367951245767
startTok However, we must be realistic. endTok	27.446474866992894
startTok The text we have is the result of the mixture of the institutional set-ups foreseen for judicial cooperation in criminal matters under both the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties respectively. endTok	86.53887201143085
startTok This is what we have, and only practical experience will show us in detail if and where there are shortcomings and what additional steps will have to be taken. endTok	73.28572797241478
startTok I am quite aware of the fact that the further development of mutual trust and mutual confidence among the judicial systems of the Member States will ease the road we have ahead of us. endTok	48.56845022591679
startTok Apart from that, the Tampere European Council has already indicated in which direction we, in the Commission, should go. endTok	53.51323306557985
startTok Among the steps to be taken will be the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the setting-up of the Euro Just project. endTok	80.9665265015543
startTok The Commission sincerely hopes that the European Parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields. endTok	26.370636283741945
startTok I do not expect you to wave through or rubber stamp everything you are confronted with in the coming years. endTok	32.5260904723135
startTok I am counting more on the European Parliament to be not only a critical observer, as it has been in this case, but also an active player in taking the Union forward in the fight against crime. endTok	47.161105062751794
startTok VOTE endTok	281.09893356486054

startTok Goebbels (PSE). endTok	201.34461614476626
startTok (FR) Madam President, when a Swede, a Spaniard, a Luxembourgeois and a German have to negotiate in English, linguistic ambiguities will arise. endTok	85.3943492109073
startTok I therefore propose, in agreement with the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, that the words 'issued by' be replaced with 'dealt with' throughout Amendment No 37. endTok	49.00860558282673
startTok The words 'issued by' also need to be added after the words 'transferable securities' . endTok	146.19069778358283
startTok The amended text will then read, and again I must read it in English, which is the lingua franca of our Parliament: 'transferable securities issued by over the counter derivatives dealt with' , etc. endTok	79.79081196371966
startTok We must also ensure that Amendment No 45 by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil is amended if it is to be adopted, because the same problem will arise. endTok	21.806324673473398
startTok Mr Goebbels, I am sorry, but I think you are jumping the gun; Amendment No 37 is an oral amendment proposing that the words 'with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale' be moved. You were asking for the place to be changed. endTok	47.15783314791106
startTok Madam President, my apologies, I was looking at Amendment No 36, which logically precedes Amendment No 37. endTok	31.02586243732158
startTok But, you are right, we are discussing Amendment No 37 and here too we have a similar problem. endTok	45.832900898442205
startTok It is not the establishments but the instruments which should have a high rating. endTok	33.31311509523691
startTok The text therefore reads: 'instruments with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation' . endTok	71.64188423145264
startTok My apologies once again for my mistake. endTok	92.52745375153216
startTok Are there any objections to this oral amendment? endTok	16.248770964299077
startTok (Parliament adopted the oral amendment) endTok	15.617667944517143
startTok (Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions in two separate votes) endTok	95.68566869591093
startTok Madam President, I asked for the floor before the sitting started in order to say something solely intended for you as President of this House. We have a procedure for visits to be made to this House to report on certain situations. endTok	36.338268969630114
startTok I do respect and agree with this procedure, as I also agree with the freedom of expression for everyone. However, for the second time in a fortnight these visits have been used to attack individuals, political parties, including my own, and institutions. endTok	86.19626886377371
startTok I feel that this behaviour, particularly in your presence, is unacceptable and totally repugnant, especially when we are on the point of an electoral campaign. endTok	44.91681362507172
startTok Therefore, particularly out of respect for you, I must say that I do not approve of this type of behaviour and in fact totally reject this. endTok	54.84501818059742
startTok I was told that this was a personal response. endTok	25.374811760854026
startTok Note will be taken of it in the Minutes. endTok	67.5639586052368
startTok Madam President, particularly out of respect for you, for myself and for this House, I did not want to explicitly refer to the issue in question. However, as a Member of this House, as general secretary of a party in the Basque Country and as an ordinary citizen of Spain, I will do so now because of the extremely serious accusations made against individuals and against parties like my own, which has a long democratic tradition, and which has scrupulously respected and defended human rights for many years. endTok	63.91945453428071
startTok Madam President, I want to express my concern that this clear defence by Mr Knörr Borràs of human rights apparently does not prevent his government from cooperating in Parliament with a political group which not only does not condemn, but collaborates with and encourages, violence against people and property. endTok	65.01597611781645
startTok I see that Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject. endTok	27.538043457500297
startTok We are not going to enter into a debate now. endTok	20.834377867334705

startTok On Third Pillar matters such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice, it is unacceptable for the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to be absent. endTok	38.12789436536566
startTok I also want to mention the translation problems, of which I will give just one example, as we do not have much time. endTok	28.02274202173044
startTok Correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts. endTok	103.39222621002936
startTok Amendment No 83 in Italian, which is the original version, states that 'il minore deve essere assistito da una persona di sua fiducia o da un perito o legale esterno' . endTok	37.114393167958326
startTok The term 'legale esterno' has been translated into French as 'avocat neutre' . I have no idea what an 'avocat neutre' is. endTok	67.6975010290466
startTok It rather seems like a contradiction in terms. endTok	126.24288646169859
startTok However, in the Spanish version the 'abogado' has disappeared completely. endTok	66.80296177106845
startTok Madam President, you have said several times that this is a very serious problem. endTok	15.139050431510281
startTok The lawyer-linguists should work very carefully to ensure that a reasonable version is produced. endTok	69.06405903983962
startTok Quite, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this is not the first time and it is indeed most worrying. endTok	28.152327507458256
startTok We shall address this problem and check all the translations. endTok	48.55814545665911
startTok Madam President, I simply wanted to add my voice to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi before the vote started, to say that I regret very much the absence of the Council from this debate on such important votes on matters of the Third Pillar. endTok	40.057998226425724
startTok I should like you, Madam President, to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such votes in future. endTok	56.13620723900575

(and therefore that the aid must not be dependent on the reciprocal orders from the donor countries). endTok	32.062179167014406

startTok Madam President, I voted in favour of the Schmidt report on the regulation of investments in transferable securities because, as I stated in this Chamber this morning, I consider it very important that the monies of the citizens of the European Union be put to good use. endTok	24.259960522072653
startTok The vast majority of these citizens are elderly people and pensioners, who want a peaceful retirement and who, after the problems encountered during the course of their working lives, have at last found financial peace of mind. endTok	105.36652161532479
startTok The regulation of investments in transferable securities, the vast majority of which are made by elderly pensioners, is thus a major step forward for the European Union. endTok	41.84510955618787

startTok I am not opposed to updating the common minimum regulations enabling a collective investment undertaking to obtain a so-called EU passport. endTok	74.63312176607525
startTok However, I do not consider it would be appropriate to do this before all Member States have approved Commissioner Monti' s proposal for minimum taxes on capital. endTok	50.40263565617326

startTok We have before us Malta and Cyprus, which are two States keen to become members. endTok	141.8827308580269
startTok Given that the complexity of the procedures has been greatly reduced, I voted in favour not only because this measure addresses the need for cohesion between these applicant States and the Union, but also because I believe that this should be taken as an invitation from Parliament to the Council and the Commission to ensure that Cyprus and Malta become fully-fledged members of the European Union as swiftly as possible. endTok	36.02002284793444
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok (FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta, whose accession is vital to the future of the European Union in the Mediterranean. endTok	21.490238735417588
startTok The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to set up the first programme to implement the strategy for Cyprus and Malta, starting in the year 2000 and lasting for five years (2000-2004). endTok	42.15453649830907
startTok The proposal therefore aims to facilitate harmonisation of their legislation with the acquis communautaire and the correct application of the acquis communautaire. endTok	47.98103076276802
startTok This new move follows on from the step taken at the Helsinki European Council last December, when it was decided that Malta had made sufficient progress to warrant opening bilateral conferences in February 2000, i.e. by the end of this month, in order to commence negotiations on the conditions of accession to the Union and the adjustments required. endTok	72.10768106069104
startTok As far as Cyprus is concerned, although the Council stated that a political settlement would facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. It also stated that its decision on accession would be made without the above being a precondition, which I welcome. endTok	57.03795409147324
startTok I have, in fact, always thought that insisting on a settlement of the present situation, in which one-third of this republic' s territory is occupied by Turkey, before starting negotiations with Cyprus was quite unfair. endTok	105.2057171648833
startTok On a more general note, it is true that the socio-economic situation in these two countries is far better than in other candidate countries. endTok	30.866244670390053
startTok However, they have received technical assistance and financial aid from the European Union in order to transpose the acquis communautaire. endTok	24.26432206918217
startTok Until 1999, this technical assistance and financial aid was provided under the fourth financial protocols (B7-4011). endTok	87.82901076289438
startTok Both countries also qualify for financial aid under the MEDA programme (B7-4012). endTok	79.01713036602415
startTok During the first and second readings of the 2000 budget, the European Parliament stressed that the new 'pre-accession' heading (B7-0), proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget, should not be limited to the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe and should also be extended to Malta and Cyprus. endTok	37.20690704105264
startTok However, because of the Council' s refusal to negotiate a review of the ceiling set for heading 7 (pre-accession) in the Financial Perspectives, the European Parliament agreed, by way of exception, and I stress that it was by way of exception, that this expenditure should be financed under heading 4 (external action) of the Financial Perspectives for the year 2000. endTok	50.54993764242107
startTok At the same time, the European Parliament created a new heading: 'pre-accession strategy for Mediterranean countries' (B7-04), under which two new articles were created for the pre-accession strategy for Malta and Cyprus pending the Commission' s presentation, following the Helsinki European Council, of the necessary legal bases and a review of the ceiling for heading 7 of the Financial Perspectives. endTok	47.80519581539139
startTok This proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases! endTok	35.79634566657559
startTok . I welcome Mr Brok' s report supporting with amendments the Commission' s proposals seeking to prepare Cyprus and Malta for EU membership. endTok	80.05682402894996
startTok The package will grant around Euro 15 million in total for the two countries in the current year. endTok	105.60096314404812
startTok It is, however, regrettable that the Commission has eschewed multiannual financing and decided instead to allocate funds on a yearly basis. endTok	44.96322899100618
startTok This is bound to have an impact on the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan spending. endTok	47.37220026855476
startTok The funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the Community 'acquis' . endTok	40.91306234053253
startTok Given the already advanced state of these two countries, compared to other applicants, this should easily allow them to be 'technically and administratively' ready for membership at the end of the 5-year programme. endTok	71.19759648884107

startTok (FR) As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs during the last parliamentary term, I welcome the adoption of this framework decision on increasing protection for our single currency. endTok	20.579983599414234
startTok The Union should use every means at its disposal to guard against counterfeiting. endTok	64.4251431648026
startTok Consumers and traders are still not familiar with the euro and it would be easy for counterfeit money to be passed in supermarkets, bureaux de change and banks and not be noticed straight away. endTok	59.40385771794609
startTok And the fact that coins are to have a national design on one side will make them even harder to identify. endTok	75.91325252721045
startTok The European information centres, which are already playing a vital role in raising public awareness of the single currency, should step up their campaigns to raise public awareness of counterfeiting. endTok	108.85033128506565
startTok On another level, we must ensure that Community and national institutions cooperate and implement an information system to collect and exchange information on counterfeiting. endTok	120.592954731139
startTok As far as criminal sanctions are concerned, measures are needed to guarantee protection for the euro from the outset and this is the purpose of the draft framework decision on increasing protection by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting presented by the European Parliament. endTok	40.770720211218794
startTok The purpose of the framework decision is to supplement the provisions of the International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency of 20 April 1929 and to facilitate its application by the Member States. endTok	31.64012362679284
startTok Each Member State must take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences set out in the framework decision are punishable. endTok	23.524309296721214
startTok These offences must be punishable even if they relate to banknotes and coins denominated in euros but not yet issued and if they are committed before 1 January 2002. endTok	42.527682230447006
startTok This is a basic element of the decision. endTok	20.456428710001248
startTok I cannot but support the rapporteur in deploring the fact that the present national currencies from which the euro is to take over are not protected. endTok	99.10529028206157
startTok We must bear in mind that national currencies could continue to change hands for another 20 years! endTok	47.973675683579174
startTok They should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation. endTok	51.81423798746713
startTok It would also appear to be in the Union' s interest for all Member States to help protect the euro, especially Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Greece, which will not be introducing the euro on 1 January 2002. endTok	43.59688881054831
startTok Although this framework decision is a step in the right direction, it confines itself to increasing criminal sanctions by harmonising substantive criminal law in the form of minimum standards. endTok	52.92738851152797
startTok There is still no uniform criminal legislation on counterfeiting and there are 15 different national systems. endTok	77.34667548790208
startTok That brings us back to the more general need to approximate criminal law called for by the European Council in Tampere. endTok	64.05025238358205
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok (DA) Mrs Cederschiöld' s report reflects an extremely peculiar form of logic. The EU introduces a common currency. endTok	55.30042900927761
startTok The risk of counterfeiting increases. Counterfeiting of the euro is perceived as an offence against the entire EU; the punishment must therefore be the same in each Member State. endTok	48.87018746293739
startTok The harmonisation of criminal law or the introduction of minimum legal standards should not be legitimised against the background of problems of one' s own creation but from considerations of reason and necessity. endTok	99.04283610267778
startTok There is nothing to indicate that the Member States' legal principles, legal traditions and carefully tailored legal systems should be lost for reasons to do with an already familiar offence such as counterfeiting. Nor, in the light of the international convention of 20 April 1929, can there be any confusion as to which country should deal with any criminal cases. endTok	92.6114973827869
startTok We are therefore voting against the report and strongly urge the abandonment of the idea of harmonising criminal law on such flimsy grounds. Instead, the focus should be upon preventing the real problem. endTok	61.75024212641389
startTok . I welcome this proposal to protect the Euro against forgers. endTok	34.84320916322277

startTok Madam President, as the representative of the Pensioners' Party, there have been many occasions on which I have stated, at the committee stage, that the European Union must intervene in regulating the lives of the elderly, and in the measures and rules on pensions, as is already the case, in coordination. endTok	36.4476220224829
startTok Similarly, as concerns the field of justice and criminal law, which we have discussed today, I believe not only that the different criminal law, juridical and administrative legislative systems should be coordinated, but also that we must at last formulate common standards: an offence committed in Italy must also be viewed as an offence in Great Britain, Spain or elsewhere. endTok	85.4655152890027
startTok I believe that we, the Parliament of the European Union, who are the elected representatives of the citizens, must give sharper impetus to ensuring that the European Union provides for the regulation of every facet of the lives of its citizens, including that of justice, and that of pensions. endTok	43.91088281547326
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok We vote against this report, because by allowing trans-border interception of telecommunication and reversing the burden of proof, the Convention will create the legal ground for large scale bugging operations in the EU. endTok	62.02785161191069
startTok That means, making a European bugging system like the transatlantic spying operation 'Echelon' perfectly legal. endTok	141.61520506654418
startTok This Convention will lead to gross abuses of people' s rights to privacy. endTok	43.6171832223906
startTok It is a major threat to civil liberties in EU. endTok	30.661731806042567

startTok What should this global actor' s objective be? endTok	137.0028196229046
startTok Doubtless our citizens would say something along the lines of 'to defend the countries of Europe better' , since that is the traditional and primordial purpose of political associations. endTok	107.19286496539061
startTok And yet this phrase is nowhere to be seen. endTok	29.084063613058948
startTok All we find are vague phrases about 'strategic partnerships' and the new prospects for trade which the complete integration of Europe would apparently bring with it. endTok	181.17801509728787
startTok The omission of this principal objective is highly revealing. endTok	35.49778027849214
startTok It demonstrates one of the main flaws in the European Union, a little-known, almost always implicit flaw, but one which goes a long way towards explaining our citizens' loss of interest. endTok	59.902093155097916
startTok There is a highly revealing passage on this point in the work programme for the year 2000 attached to the strategic guidelines. endTok	34.5854045371646
startTok Addressing the fundamental question of relations with the United States, the Commission mentions just one priority: 'we will endeavour to reduce and eliminate as far as possible the disputes in transatlantic trade' (page 4). endTok	80.7108836843535
startTok While we are on the subject, where one would expect a firm declaration of intent to defend European interests in the numerous trade conflicts under way, one merely finds the desire to eliminate conflict, which hardly sounds like determination on the part of the Commission to fight its corner. endTok	109.20744357745984
startTok How strange that the Commission should lose its instinct for self-preservation just as Europe is integrating. endTok	112.86000180220802
startTok I think there are three reasons for this: 1) in their endeavour to transcend the nation states, the European institutions have lost touch with the people and, in losing touch with the people, they have become putty in the hands of foreign interests; 2) having lost touch with the people, the men and women working in these institutions have started to become used to reasoning not as the sole champions of the people, but as international officials in charge of regulating a global system; 3) integration may afford economies of scale and productivity gains; but it also causes far more to be lost because, when it breaks nations, it breaks subtle expressions of solidarity and, with them, the willingness to present a united front. endTok	70.60537707742266
startTok . (FR) I share the overriding sense of deep and keen dissatisfaction expressed during the debate. endTok	85.97149018467104
startTok I do, of course, understand the constraints of the moment and I am prepared to entertain the idea of the risk of failure.... endTok	33.2295066033842
startTok However, experience has taught me that, in politics, modest ambitions are never the key to success! endTok	77.42963015732387
startTok I shall not keep saying that I am disappointed, because you need to hope in order to be disappointed.... and I have had no hope since the investiture debate. endTok	58.93165281165414
startTok As for the future, given that the Commission has shown itself incapable of taking action against fascism in Austria, I am convinced that blocking measures to liberalise the single market is the only way of administering a salutary electric shock treatment to the heart of all the countries in the Union. endTok	31.060107899216305
startTok - (IT) On behalf of the Italian Communists, I would like to express great dissatisfaction at the contents of the document, which was expected to define the strategic guidelines for Europe up until the year 2005. endTok	40.23988029559046
startTok Employment: for many years now, the connection between economic growth and an increase in employment has not been borne out by reality, and yet, despite the fact that it has been proved to be useless, the same recipe is being put forward again as a solution to the acute problem of unemployment. endTok	41.940575124208486
startTok And yet our President is a fine economist. endTok	51.014630052844446
startTok Pensions: The document states that, 'Member States must remain responsible for modernising social protection systems' , and yet the Commission itself intervened in the case of Italy, repeatedly calling for swift changes to the pension system to reduce rights and decrease pension payments. endTok	89.09716333496054
startTok And yet President Prodi himself gave firm guidance to the Italian Government during those years and is therefore aware of the nature and extent of the sacrifices demanded of our fellow citizens and which they made in order to sign up to the euro, and he is aware of the major role played by Italy in European development. endTok	50.00661965604082
startTok For this very reason, we cannot agree to cut pensions further. endTok	102.37007140994393
startTok There is an agreement on this issue which provides for a review in 2001 and this must not take place one moment sooner. endTok	36.311317477481275
startTok What is more, the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control. endTok	158.22133141071853
startTok I would therefore ask the Commission to please refrain from taking this unacceptable ideological approach and making such declarations which create instability and uncertainty among the citizens. endTok	75.42226130518277
startTok I referred to the case of Italy, not only because the President is very familiar with it, but because Community statistics (Eurostat) themselves reveal that not only has Italy' s welfare expenditure - currently 25.9% - been below the Community average (28.2%) since 1990, but that it has also been well below that of countries considered to be doing well, such as Germany (29.9%) and France (30.8%). endTok	122.9832243133002

startTok (FR) The proposed action and programme presented by Mr Prodi are vague in the extreme and the social question is missing yet again. endTok	118.9771122881089
startTok In fact, the word seems to have been banished from the Commission' s vocabulary, whereas liberal and American references abound. endTok	67.60182419405308
startTok Mr Prodi reverts to the contested concept of 'governance' ; contested because it favours state intervention over a proper working democracy and refers to the notion as defined by the IMF, whose ideological agenda is predicated solely on liberalism and monetarism. endTok	99.50328308962762
startTok The shift in meaning is not just semantic... The only logical thing to do on reading this document is to pursue the mass market and generalised deregulation and forget about the realignment of European policy which our citizens hoped for. endTok	86.09111300410947
startTok Mr Prodi talks solely of 'mechanisms' and 'structures' and fails to set out a single balanced project which responds to the aspirations of our people. endTok	109.80003529515771
startTok Enlargement appears to be an end in itself, but unless decisions are made on a social policy, a common value and an institution to strengthen the cohesion and democratisation of the Union, the Europe bequeathed to us at the end of Mr Prodi' s presidency may well be a simple common market area within the context of generalised globalisation, rather than the community of destiny which we hope for. endTok	57.003151509057396
startTok Finally, Mr Prodi' s complacency towards the Austrian Government in the name of an exaggerated sense of protocol (which in no way obliges him to send a message of congratulations) would in itself warrant a vote of no confidence. endTok	86.92978859843241

startTok The nature of the EU has not changed. endTok	24.117905942588823
startTok Since the beginning it has served the interests of a few dozen large financial and industrial groups and their pressure groups. endTok	81.64413419932507
startTok But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the EU so that it can apply for joint global governance with the United States, which it also sees as its future competitor and rival. endTok	61.9993457582197
startTok This new imperial policy advocates reorganising European and national institutions, strengthening the power of the state, increasing competition, establishing a European army and redistributing financial resources. endTok	90.2336829419814
startTok Even daring to refer to the defence of a 'European social model' is a shamefaced lie because the more the EU combats the United States, the more it becomes its clone. endTok	66.37092567418452

startTok We abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution for the following reasons. endTok	22.4374590265859
startTok Firstly, the motion does not condemn clearly enough the vagueness of the priorities and commitments indicated in the Commission' s programme. endTok	56.655372962101744
startTok Secondly, in terms of the definition of priorities for the next five years, we consider that the main question to be considered by the Commission is its role in interinstitutional relations within the EU which neither the programme nor the motion mention. endTok	58.410230514509024
startTok In our opinion, the Commission' s role in the near future will be dependent on some of the European political initiative being returned by the governments of the Member States following the Santer Commission scandal. endTok	30.966586657281642
startTok This is very positive as this is how the national parliaments, on which the governments depend, will continue to show that their democratic mandate is indispensable to European construction. endTok	49.76707593576152
startTok The truth is that the European Parliament is still failing to gain the confidence and interest of national public opinion which is determined not to think about Europe, as demonstrated by the low turnout in the recent elections. endTok	49.96936378358071
startTok The mechanisms used in the cooperation between the governments of the Member States must therefore be reinforced and made more coherent, more transparent and more democratic. endTok	39.273158137075775
startTok We welcome the efforts of Mr Prodi to improve the public image of the Commission and the need for the latter to agree with this House and the Council. endTok	25.594702268178487
startTok However, the priority should be to reform the governmental cooperation mechanisms, particularly by creating a Council of Ministers for Europe which, by itself and in coordination with the other European institutions, can assume the responsibility for transforming the political decisions of the European Councils into specific actions. endTok	79.91562828713217

startTok Madam President, the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly was coloured in 1999 by growing concern about the sustainability of the cooperation models derived from the Lomé Conventions. endTok	49.23108065008506
startTok Back in 1994, the Joint Assembly passed an initial resolution, in which our fellow Member Dominique Souchet was closely involved, expressing its alarm at the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which contradicted the very principle of Community preference which was fundamental to this cooperation. endTok	83.4761551252289
startTok These fears have been taking shape over the last two years and the banana row is the clearest expression of them. endTok	27.507432047745464
startTok The developing countries are asked to fall into line with the liberalisation of trade, despite their vulnerable economies. endTok	72.76740793617243
startTok Although Mr Corrie' s report roundly condemns this situation and reaffirms the Joint Assembly' s attachment to the Lomé model, he fails to highlight properly a second problem which, to tell the truth, is also the result of the free-trade error, namely the incoherence of the regional trade agreements signed by the European Union. endTok	59.106868364239254
startTok The cooperation agreement with South Africa is a prime example. endTok	38.872512457420434
startTok The Council approved the agreement negotiated by the Commission despite the fact that a basic section, namely agriculture, had not been finalised. endTok	62.61144623982626
startTok As Paul-Marie Coûteaux rightly said in his intervention yesterday and in his proposed amendments, one wonders exactly what political coherence this blank cheque represents. endTok	139.01505455665037
startTok It is most worrying, especially as a similar agreement with Mexico appears to be taking shape. endTok	69.96551859205988
startTok Nor is it possible to support the rapporteur' s call for the European Development Fund to be merged with the Community budget. endTok	23.931696656011823
startTok We want to maintain the clear commitment and the responsibility of each Member State, which is made possible by its intergovernmental nature. endTok	50.9813147663433
startTok Alas, there have been far too many instances of collective aid for which no-one feels responsible being derailed and we do not want to extend this disastrous system to the EDF. endTok	47.64956408312967
startTok Madam President, I welcome Mr Corrie' s report as a balanced assessment of the work the Assembly has carried out over the last year. endTok	28.196117304022657
startTok The report comes just after agreement has been reached on the renewal of the existing Lomé Convention, which expires at the end of this month. endTok	45.125060247193694
startTok The new agreement provides for a development budget of EUR 13.5 billion over the next seven years. endTok	36.60974195921451
startTok It is vital that this money is used to benefit the poorest groups and individuals within the ACP countries. endTok	35.628465559465646

startTok 80% of the 13.9 million AIDS related deaths in the world have taken place in this region. endTok	51.3032893221365
startTok The AIDS problem in Africa is not only a private or public health issue but a development one. endTok	124.66453046486176
startTok The effects of the AIDS pandemic mean that any progress in development matters in the sub-Saharan region is being neutralised or reversed. endTok	58.046006097108986
startTok From the data which I am referring to today, it is evident that this disease is taking a disproportionate toll on the developing countries least capable of responding to its wide-ranging impact. endTok	37.60700557355016
startTok It is clear that the spread of AIDS in the sub-Saharan African Continent is linked to poverty. endTok	29.765595817781556
startTok AIDS treatments that may cost $18 000 per annum for one person are obviously not affordable by countries whose annual health budget may be less than $5 per capita. endTok	138.580160789363
startTok It is incumbent on the European Union and the United Nations to address what is a social and fatal problem in a comprehensive and strategic manner. endTok	30.720988015261298

startTok It is essential that these groups are able to obtain the limited resources they require to be effective. endTok	46.81390155443121

startTok I know that this is somewhat controversial, particularly, because of the attitude of the United States Government towards the Castro regime. endTok	35.750527605858174
startTok However, on this occasion, the European Union will be insisting on introducing political criteria into the Lomé Convention Accord. endTok	55.6281381780236
startTok Good governance criteria broadly covering questions of refugees, corruption, human rights and democracy will be part of the finalised accord between the European Union and all countries signing the Lomé Convention from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific region. endTok	93.10772999445574

startTok (FR) The Lomé Convention, on which the entire structure of relations between the European Union and the 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries rests, is still the most efficient and ambitious development tool in north-south relations. endTok	51.25101340693239
startTok After years of 'good and loyal service' it is still the main symbol of efforts by the European Union to promote development and improve the lot of the poorest countries. endTok	56.389680231582005
startTok It is the humane face of Europe... endTok	30.197645506400313
startTok And the merit of Mr Corrie' s report is that it highlights the value of this original, proactive development instrument, together with the work carried out by the Joint Assembly. endTok	35.996542754462034
startTok Especially as the vulnerable architecture of this ambitious structure has been threatened. endTok	89.74942988660814
startTok The partnership between the European Union and the ACP was negotiated in the difficult time of the changeover to the new millennium. endTok	34.41920694222076

startTok Now, more than 30 years after the inauguration of an unprecedented partnership between north and south, the tool which has proven its worth and served its time needs to be adapted in order to meet new challenges. endTok	69.53040011102094
startTok Which is why the new 20-year agreement due to be signed in Fiji on 31 May represents more than the simple renewal of the Conventions regulating relations between Europe and the ACP. endTok	90.76000956130767
startTok It should seal their revival. endTok	41.873642526489604
startTok It brilliantly illustrates the political dimension of a partnership which constitutes the only forum for dialogue and political exchange within north-south relations. endTok	81.28500965909112
startTok At a time when the Joint Assembly is opening its doors ever wider to the elected representatives from parliaments in the ACP, this dimension must not only be preserved; above all, it must be encouraged. endTok	68.51434585323497
startTok The Joint Assembly also represents the tribunal before which the countries of Europe and the developing countries defend their common interests. endTok	47.959357675529
startTok After the debacle in Seattle, our duty from now on is to adopt a concerted position and ensure that the rules of world trade develop and are used to fight poverty. endTok	96.8493188523278
startTok The partnership is here to stay and the way is clear for it to be modernised. endTok	45.87192837722643
startTok First, by promoting a trend towards regional meetings of the Joint Assembly, as recommended in the Corrie report, thereby enabling working methods to be adapted to the new types of cooperation envisaged (regional economic partnership agreements). endTok	115.92810548465374
startTok Then, by gearing actions to micro-projects and making them accessible to the civil society in the southern countries and, finally, by calling for enlargement and the rapid accession of Cuba, which all the ACP called for at Nassau and which has now made a formal application. endTok	103.46896742920102
startTok But we must also preserve the original spirit of the Lomé Convention, which has enabled relations between the European Union and the ACP to become what they are today: a real partnership based on fairness and mutual respect. endTok	50.14738376407984
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok (FR) A few days after the demonstrations in Seattle, the ministers of the European Union imposed an agreement compatible with the rules of the WTO on the ACP, i.e. their former colonies. endTok	46.06566474302422
startTok Apart from reducing the volume of exports from these countries to the Community market, what we term 'development aid' to the ACP has fallen constantly, from 70% of total European Union aid in 1986 to 30% in 1998. endTok	117.04840267231054
startTok The European Union prefers to send its funds to Eastern Europe, the former USSR and Asia, where there is greater opportunity for profit. endTok	78.09055760986826
startTok The ACP-EU agreements make a mockery of democratic principles and the fight against corruption, by sparing those who are responsible: when will sanctions and controls be imposed on Total-Elf, which is supplying those responsible for the civil war in the Congo? endTok	68.40231347076374
startTok Or on Shell? endTok	202.0809049151544

startTok Few of my constituents will probably be aware that the EU is the biggest foreign aid donor in the world. endTok	43.61199435678135
startTok While others may have the biggest rockets, the EU has the deepest pockets. endTok	52.48622661906384
startTok This is something that the EU can rightly be proud of, and I think we should shout it from the rooftops more often. endTok	43.156270614102105
startTok The Labour Government' s record in Britain is also a proud one. endTok	167.68456372181723
startTok Clare Short, MP, is one of the few Cabinet-level Ministers for international development in the world and, as such, can take her case to the very heart of government. endTok	92.1850517498386
startTok Gordon Brown, MP, meanwhile, has led international efforts to relieve crippling levels of Third World debt and ensured that Labour' s campaign to reduce poverty does not end at the English Channel. endTok	118.01205287259862
startTok Whether through the minimum wage in Manchester or debt relief in Durban, Labour' s aim of poverty reduction remains the same. endTok	186.01968277238694
startTok There is still much to be done, however. endTok	30.86720872573681
startTok The next great challenge is to re-launch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed to take off last December in Seattle. endTok	135.71910029813526
startTok It must be a 'development round' , in which developing countries, effectively excluded from previous rounds, are fully included. endTok	73.51529338164269
startTok For the best way to reduce world poverty is to help developing countries help themselves. endTok	72.22788312738787
startTok Developing countries want trade not aid, a help up not a hand-out. endTok	751.3560026830884
startTok And the best way to help developing countries help themselves is to open up world markets to allow them to sell their products. endTok	69.54459176148663
startTok In this way, the power of globalisation can be harnessed for the good, to benefit the poor not just the wealthy, the many not just the few. endTok	97.42691587654701

startTok In parallel, it can benefit from substantial financial support via the PHARE programme. endTok	121.94961171326922
startTok However, the EU' s present policy in the Balkans is fragmentary, inconsistent and schizophrenic in nature. endTok	33.581526093140894
startTok There are different types of agreements or relations or lack of relations - going even as far as the embargo on Yugoslavia - which result in a fragmented and ineffectual approach. endTok	105.6799484665169
startTok There is no sense of regionality for the Balkans, which would include everyone without exceptions or vindictiveness. endTok	48.55411677070362
startTok Finally, intervention by the European Union to solve the problem of FYROM' s name - which is unfortunately becoming a long drawn out problem and could make an already tense situation even more fraught - and to respond more energetically towards negotiating FYROM' s principles within a reasonable time scale, is necessary and useful. endTok	133.43853969603452

startTok (FR) The Commission' s stated desire to strengthen relations between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the Community would appear to respond to a primary concern: a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south-east Europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the Second World War. endTok	51.40453266369202
startTok Having been crushed beneath the heel of triumphant Communism, this region has not stopped paying the price for the collapse of the Soviet system since the beginning of the 1990s. endTok	46.42231346108733
startTok And yet, under these difficult conditions, especially since the military intervention in the Balkans by NATO, some of these genuinely European countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which entitles them to aspire to join the Community. endTok	93.75608983128136
startTok In this sense, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both an exemplary and a symbolic case. endTok	37.06673781681035
startTok Exemplary because it proves that the Balkan countries are not at the mercy of fate and that those of them which so wish are already in a position to meet the standard requirements imposed by the European Union in stability and association agreements. endTok	51.984153931166574
startTok Symbolic because it reflects well on the Fifteen' s project to see the birth of a policy which is common to the five countries in the region (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FYROM and Albania) and which would make economic and political stability a pressing and urgent requirement. endTok	104.96149201657116
startTok The UEN Group is all the more in favour of sending this signal to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it leaves plenty of room for the independence and sovereignty of the states. A satisfactory solution cannot be found in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states concerned; but nor can there be any question of blocking their process of integration because one of them is considered unworthy of such promotion. endTok	63.97391351997641

startTok It is not its job to subrogate to people in their choices or, failing that, reinvent a new variation on a 'sense of history' which perceives self-determination as a one-way street. endTok	71.65356842141566
startTok The Community construction only makes sense if it creates positive discriminations alone, and the UEN Group hopes that this signal to FYROM and specific action in its wake will help us make a sustainable contribution to the development and peaceful coexistence of the nation states in this fully-paid up part of Europe. endTok	94.75090652263569

startTok We are convinced that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change is dialogue at all levels and with full and transparent information as its basis. endTok	70.45568298213618
startTok We have had in the recent past different experiences and approaches on how to deal with large-scale operations of corporate restructuring, often affecting the lives of large numbers of European people. endTok	80.3895132654966
startTok In some cases these operations were prepared well in advance, fully involving workers' representatives, with due care being taken to search for the least damaging solutions. endTok	138.33535200727445
startTok Where necessary, workers likely to be affected were prepared through employability measures to face the challenge of sudden unemployment. endTok	168.75750307702515
startTok In other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected. endTok	72.64727792845325
startTok On every occasion, and as recently as last October in this House, the Commission has highlighted the following basic positions. endTok	69.1757568648295
startTok Firstly, decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management. endTok	123.97055040693161
startTok This means that, when contemplating actions likely to lead to serious social consequences, job losses for example, companies should always actively search for and choose the least negative and least damaging solution. endTok	115.5403112183432
startTok Secondly, when dismissals prove to be inevitable, the utmost must be done to reinforce the employability of those concerned. endTok	89.68748286528054
startTok This requires anticipation, timely preparation and careful management of these processes. endTok	100.06788335302582
startTok Thirdly, nothing can justify the absence of timely, effective and comprehensive information and consultation of the workers' and employees' representatives before such operations are launched or publicly announced. endTok	146.60941179670894
startTok Worker involvement is always, and particularly in the event of corporate restructuring, not only a basic right but a necessary precondition for the social acceptance of such operations. endTok	120.27865001108313
startTok In the end it is also a decisive factor of their success, as no collectivity can survive and prosper without trust, dialogue, partnership and solidarity between its different components. endTok	80.08744548666648
startTok These basic ideas meet with a wide consensus in Europe. endTok	64.77596843726755
startTok This is what intelligent restructuring is about. endTok	57.46132857310908
startTok It is more and more rare to see companies embark on damaging restructuring operations ignoring these fundamental concerns, as unfortunately was sometimes the case in the past. endTok	120.27193985869373
startTok We have built a wide range of instruments which meet these concerns in recent years in the European Union. endTok	23.283004522352023
startTok We have set minimum requirements at European level, which all Member States and all companies must observe when contemplating job losses, especially when they are massive, or preparing other decisions likely to affect workers. endTok	85.76124144344439
startTok The collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings directive and the European works council directive constitute our legal framework, protecting the workers' rights and ensuring fair standards in the field of information and consultation at national and transnational level respectively. endTok	98.25891192156116
startTok As regards the national and/or local level of employee involvement, the Commission wishes to underline again the need for proper information and consultation of employees' representatives before any redundancies are decided or implemented, as provided for in the collective redundancies directive and in other national provisions. endTok	108.60619010479391
startTok I wish to recall that it is, in principle, up to national courts to deal with possible violations of these rules, if and when they are brought before them by national representatives. endTok	74.6360044372457
startTok However, even when existing rules or arrangements are formally respected this does not mean that management' s attitude is socially irreprehensible. endTok	164.40965378861515
startTok In fact, the Commission has argued for some time now that the rules we have established are not sufficient to deal with the challenges of today. endTok	34.037219417770196
startTok In a world characterised by permanent change and in the context of high levels of unemployment, the rules in force seem to us to be outdated as they do not allow or promote the key ideas behind our employment strategy and our approach to change, anticipation, risk prevention and employability. endTok	80.18981830735683
startTok That is why in November 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support. endTok	49.21305499068432
startTok We thank you for that. endTok	37.877624374090985
startTok Unfortunately, the other branch of the legislative power, the Council, has not yet - more than one year after the presentation of the proposal - begun working on it. endTok	43.03520243937517
startTok I hope that this debate contributes to reminding Member States of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative. endTok	34.96078880915614
startTok We have recently heard from the Portuguese Presidency that a serious debate on this proposal will soon be launched. endTok	37.719241365680816
startTok The forthcoming French Presidency also seems willing to give this dossier the high priority it deserves. endTok	104.36903233329883
startTok The Commission sincerely hopes that Parliament and the Council quickly finalise this important dossier which constitutes, in our view, the most effective answer to the concerns raised by cases such as the ones which brought us here today. endTok	72.17796102691966
startTok As for the transnational level of employee involvement there is some indication that at least in one case the companies may have breached transnational information and consultation agreements which they had concluded with their European workforce. endTok	66.79700531349451
startTok They may have at least exploited some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force. endTok	82.73097686092946
startTok The Commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this. endTok	51.30950338037228
startTok In any case, I wish to say to those who believe that their rights in that respect were ignored that adequate means of enforcement and redress are available to them, notably through relevant national jurisdictional instances. endTok	62.81691955087368
startTok The Commission is aware of your request to proceed immediately with a revision of the European Works Council Directive. endTok	24.85085244339618
startTok As recognised in the report, which we will adopt in the forthcoming weeks, we accept that the directive contains some loopholes. endTok	53.55013074544801
startTok Nevertheless, as my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already underlined on other occasions, when deciding whether or not to revise the directive immediately, different considerations must be taken into account. endTok	41.51710253349735
startTok First, any revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements, unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the negotiating parties no longer applies. endTok	102.45391911675999
startTok Secondly, an immediate revision would make things much more complicated as regards progress in respect of the other pending dossiers in this field like European company statutes and the national information and consultation proposal. endTok	100.7434753921929
startTok The successful outcome of these other dossiers could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the EWC Directive and even provide some degree of a solution to the problems identified above. endTok	98.65962139852351
startTok That is why we tend to consider that it might be more appropriate in this context to proceed with the revision of the European Works Council Directive only after the conclusion of those two dossiers and following a more complete evaluation of the application of the directive. endTok	37.222025985713444
startTok Action is not limited to legislation. endTok	70.24468143605267
startTok To encourage and support dialogue as the cornerstone of the successful adaptation to change the Commission is also developing the recommendations of the Lillehammer Report by preparing the setting up of a European observatory on industrial change. endTok	59.747165243531526
startTok We are also developing another suggestion of that expert group, the Managing Change Report. endTok	136.74482113173534
startTok Let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this House. endTok	43.04403754352654
startTok As for the enforcement of the links between competition policy and social policy, let me remind you that there is a provision in the merger regulation which enables workers' representatives to be heard by the Commission in the framework of the relevant procedure. endTok	39.30488495247611
startTok Generally speaking, we recognise the need for proper consideration to be given in different instances to all aspects surrounding these kinds of operations, including their effects in terms of employment. endTok	70.26853412019648
startTok As an example of this I mention that public authorities, notably the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid that came into force on 1 January this year so as to ensure that public funding remains associated with the recipients of regional aid and consequently with the jobs attached to the investment. endTok	68.04592845641551
startTok To this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years. endTok	54.13072263886067
startTok The same provision was included in the Structural Funds Regulation which means that it applies to all investments cofinanced by the structural funds. endTok	32.48367599765857
startTok Social cohesion and the interplay of policies at EU-level is the focus of the forthcoming Lisbon Summit. endTok	33.136333816062184
startTok I know we will be coming back to these issues again in the future to see how we can best make sure our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in Europe. endTok	42.955624683400565
startTok Thank you very much Commissioner. endTok	6.573405008007721
startTok Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I understand you have a point of order. endTok	36.413165921515116
startTok If it is a personal statement, would you be prepared to wait until the end of this debate, at which stage I would be happy to call you? endTok	36.23616348482304
startTok Mr President, the problem is one of public honour in this Parliament, it is not a personal statement. endTok	32.24637389623278
startTok This morning, the President of Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to allow me to make a point of order. endTok	30.744178661826496
startTok Unfortunately, this is not the first time that Madam President has shown this inadmissible behaviour towards me. endTok	35.09890178361923
startTok In doing so, Madam President has breached Rule 142 that states that points of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak. endTok	124.07120287296898
startTok She has also breached Rule 122 that gives the right to all the Members of this House to make observations, observations which in this case refute the remarks made by another deputy, Mr Vidal-Quadras. endTok	48.76312220781426
startTok This partisan behaviour of our President should be criticised most firmly. endTok	122.55289447522283
startTok I will willingly accept Madam President' s apologies any time. endTok	66.85821968166216
startTok Thank you for your statement. endTok	13.027538686130397
startTok We will certainly make sure that the President is informed of your statement. endTok	36.57133951019573
startTok I can assure you that as far as I am aware the President never likes to have a debate on issues in the middle of a vote. endTok	25.205469969610558
startTok Therefore the House was probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage. endTok	64.5225078606348
startTok But thank you for your remarks. endTok	24.27075591451166
startTok Mr President, I welcome Commissioner Liikanen' s words, and I am contributing to the debate - we are all contributing to the debate - because, although the subject is broad in scope, it also concerns a specific fact. endTok	54.35100653278911
startTok The subject in question is of great political and social importance. endTok	47.640942212363875
startTok Free enterprise, free movement and free competition are essential pillars of the political and economic structure of the European Union. endTok	47.404185544067595
startTok Company restructuring is part of the principle of free determination of investments, and must therefore be defended. endTok	62.71264839786546
startTok However, all too often we witness events which are in stark contrast with these principles. endTok	72.11424863150903
startTok Today, we are witnessing one of these cases, which, on the surface, may seem to be of minor importance and affect only the specific industry, but which, if it is allowed to pass without an authoritative intervention by the European Union, will become an unwritten rule which will cause problems for many of the Member States and the Union as a whole. endTok	54.2819956562777
startTok An American company - Goodyear - with production sites in Italy, Germany and England, is reviewing its production and relocation, justifiably, in its own view. endTok	125.90473035897001
startTok However, it seems to be doing it without observing the relevant Community legislation, for it is certainly not giving reasonable notice to employees or heeding the obligation to render an account of their use of Italian and European public finances. endTok	62.77912967933709
startTok In Italy, Commissioner Liikanen, Goodyear is not carrying out restructuring but closing a plant whose production covers 14% of the market and which Goodyear itself defined as, 'having the most highly-skilled workforce of all its plants' , a plant which was opened with a total of EUR 85 million of European capital. endTok	110.44623136976165
startTok No notice was given of the closure, and no intention was shown of discussing the fate of the plant or its workers, despite the fact that the public funds invested in that plant make it much more public than private. endTok	108.09258915195845
startTok It would be a serious matter if every non-European company were to learn to use Europe as a bus where you do not have to pay for the ticket, you do not have to pay for cooperation, you benefit from using the facility and you leave without being accountable to anyone. endTok	60.060859415465615
startTok Europe has to guarantee every sort of freedom, including freedom to use one' s own money for the purposes of one' s own freedom and not to let others use it at will, others who make demands and then, when the break is made, refuse even to discuss the terms of the break, despite the fact that this is a break which has been declared unilaterally. endTok	112.11416784062408
startTok Just now, Commissioner Liikanen was talking of restructuring which must not be uninformed. endTok	68.86487581952545
startTok Sadly, in this case, he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring. endTok	56.648187324867074
startTok I would also like to point out to Commissioner Liikanen that it is not easy to take a matter to a national court. endTok	17.142505465867902
startTok Of course, it is always possible, but when jobs have been lost and factories closed down, the idea of going to Court when proceedings are as lengthy as they are in Italy is not very reassuring. endTok	69.64773394410207
startTok Commissioner Liikanen, we expect an authoritative intervention. endTok	78.83272219587813
startTok As Parliament, we are, of course, expecting to be able to contribute to the resolution you mentioned - we are ready and waiting - but we expect an authoritative intervention on this, which can on no account be allowed to reach its conclusion and be forgotten, as has almost happened already. endTok	84.8299812333267
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the second time within the space of four months, we find ourselves debating the restructuring of companies in Europe. endTok	26.2327101875186
startTok This is - as it was the first time round - sparked off by the reorganisation of large companies, which is linked to a drop in employment. endTok	35.16189570541449
startTok I would like to make it quite clear that the Liberal Group is against any political interference in companies, in terms of both finance and management. endTok	31.953990017339983
startTok Our task is to draft legislation and to monitor to ensure that it is observed. endTok	50.75356825859195
startTok It appears that Goodyear in Italy received Italian and European subsidies to the tune of approximately EUR 40 million. endTok	67.23604681286427
startTok The company went under despite this. endTok	100.65531579360405
startTok This goes to show that jobs cannot be bought. endTok	43.51532829976189
startTok The market is a law unto itself. endTok	67.84347002164851
startTok As such, state aid costs the government twice: first in subsidies and then in unemployment benefit. endTok	259.25193034616166
startTok Surely this cannot be the role of your, my and the citizens' tax money? endTok	233.63067357487913
startTok All this, of course, does not mean that our Group does not share the concern of the Italian Members regarding the effects of the closure on the region concerned. endTok	38.98867380661424
startTok My Group is also opposed in principle to the naming of specific companies in this resolution, for two reasons: firstly because this creates selective responsibility. endTok	83.34764570057803
startTok A company is pilloried one day and not the next. endTok	74.870477864607
startTok Why should this be the case? endTok	35.859736356183554
startTok Michelin caused a great stir. endTok	101.2995095488287
startTok But I did not hear a squeak when Nissan and IBM were discussed, where, similarly, a great number of European employees were involved. endTok	67.02116779786786
startTok Secondly, this is not fair towards employees of other companies where reorganisations also take place and where it hurts too. endTok	85.82829314806108
startTok My Group has signed a joint resolution with EPP and UEN, in which, however, we made it clear right from the outset that we are against the naming of company names. endTok	40.46631787568469
startTok This is why the Liberal Group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9. endTok	56.572253617482325
startTok If these paragraphs are nonetheless adopted, my Group will abstain from the final vote. endTok	86.45563939474872
startTok I do hope that this will not be necessary. endTok	13.458704403888026
startTok Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005 both talk of full employment for which two essential conditions are required. endTok	28.816924412028644
startTok The first is to create new jobs for young people entering the labour market and the second is not to lose jobs. endTok	32.040790135077536
startTok Yet the current situation in Europe provides us with clear examples of how jobs are being destroyed, particularly, and most seriously, by companies which are making huge profits. endTok	79.38546268184449
startTok In the past, workers were asked to show their solidarity with companies in order to ensure their survival. Now the companies are making huge profits but are also making workers redundant. endTok	70.27778256364472
startTok Examples have been given in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for Italy. endTok	75.73966345697221
startTok There is also another hidden way of making workers redundant, as practised for example in Spain by the Ericsson company under the term 'externalising' . Note that sensitive words like 'redundancy' are not used. endTok	79.59803165752233
startTok Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights. endTok	252.99712480025133
startTok This is just an underhand way of making workers redundant. endTok	30.578157294610968
startTok Commissioner, if the European institutions really believe in what they say about full employment, they must take clear steps to secure this. endTok	118.87787146116659
startTok They must revise the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations. They must revise the directive on collective redundancies, reduce the working day, link European subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the European Union. endTok	70.3467150835587
startTok Mr President, sadly, once again, Parliament is having to discuss the restructuring of companies in Europe. endTok	41.22659457865275
startTok Yet again, workers are likely to lose their jobs. endTok	66.16322821582789
startTok This time, I am referring to the workers of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina. endTok	37.132174586730955
startTok As has already been pointed out, in one month' s time, 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income. endTok	55.83363900637099
startTok Despite the commitment they have shown to the company and despite their high level of professionalism - which has made the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe - these workers are likely to be removed from the production cycle, while Goodyear, after years of benefiting from state and European subsidies, is totally free to walk out. endTok	74.24292814414117
startTok I do not think this is at all fair, either to the workers at the Cisterna plant or to all those Italian and European citizens whose taxes have, albeit indirectly, enabled Goodyear to benefit from the state aids I have just mentioned. endTok	84.68812017674823
startTok The European Commission and the Council must, at last, assume all the necessary responsibilities, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to Community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long-term agreements to protect jobs. endTok	37.0547739098062
startTok Today, we ask the Commission to start by protecting the workers at Goodyear in Cisterna, and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the Cisterna plant. endTok	63.930549915422105
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to remind the House that there is very little time available, and therefore that any measure - including those already cited by the Commission in its introductory report - which we adopt must have an immediate, timely effect. endTok	39.312344988139344
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, as far as restructuring goes, there is no doubt that European companies must adapt so that they are better placed to face new challenges or go under. endTok	60.94881818257809
startTok We are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management. endTok	42.06958556781572
startTok Although it is laudable from an economic point of view to make structural changes in order to be more competitive and win market shares, this approach may be reprehensible if it is made at the request of financiers, often shareholders, with the sole unavowed aim of increasing the financial standing of the company in order to raise profits which they can then withdraw from the company. endTok	62.84376356846568
startTok The various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers, be they by Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this respect. endTok	92.32969657487183
startTok Rationalised management and improved profits should, in my view, serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost, and any financial benefits should follow. endTok	161.19478334575015
startTok However, what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regrouping and relocation, with all the familiar consequences, both on the quality of products and at the social level, especially in terms of unemployment, difficult working conditions and increased flexibility: consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level, especially on the family unit. endTok	106.07449761724722
startTok There is a very real risk of seeing a two-headed monster emerge on this planet, with poor countries providing the labour and rich countries providing the capital. endTok	62.71629675795206
startTok Surely Europe should act as a safeguard, maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare? endTok	92.18531549376452
startTok We must not forget that it is human resources which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good results. endTok	61.29105830607572
startTok Finally, allow me to remind you that the third letter of the EDD Group to which I belong stands for 'difference' . endTok	48.19720937833363
startTok Europe has a duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to savage restructuring for profit at all costs. Without doubt, the voice of difference in this monotonous flood of restructuring. endTok	77.33970514766915
startTok Mr President, last month in the UK, in a region that neighbours mine, the Michelin Group announced significant redundancies at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres. endTok	84.73820921233595
startTok I, like all Members present, am saddened by this loss of jobs. endTok	151.66630402830427
startTok Equally, I am saddened by the announcement made by Goodyear that has prompted this resolution. endTok	48.957360534766785
startTok But I doubt very much indeed whether a European works council would have been able to change this company' s decision. endTok	48.964201006388514
startTok This House is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes, in this institution, forget that Europe cannot survive alone. endTok	99.50760084781479
startTok We need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent. endTok	90.27577293942855
startTok In my few months here, I have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the EU, nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave. endTok	89.81283294470818
startTok In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective, adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted. endTok	70.17123123208671
startTok Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant. endTok	64.27175526287478
startTok In a world where surely less regulation is the key, we in this House seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the European Union, untempted by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens. endTok	56.28142284116534
startTok We MEPs speak often about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way of creating them. endTok	163.43892310766802
startTok Take a large successful business, add European regulations, and within months you have created a small one. endTok	242.11614594623737
startTok Perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here. endTok	88.63439241184723
startTok Mr President, I will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today. endTok	68.43294747055901
startTok In this respect, I share Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel' s view that we cannot talk about these in detail. endTok	25.66770368719538
startTok But maybe next time, we ought to discuss CORUS, the merger which has now taken place between our Nederlandse Hoogovens and British Steel. endTok	80.70264811159235
startTok I would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wider context and examine the link between policy in the field of company mergers within the European Union and policy in other fields. endTok	35.76717805330175
startTok In this light, I am pleased that Mr Liikanen is present and we do not only have to hold this discussion, where the interests of employees are concerned, with Mrs Diamantopoulou but we can involve the Commissioners who are active in other fields. endTok	42.641842477570385
startTok I would also like to advocate coherence in the Commission' s policy from these different vantage points, unlike my predecessor, who holds the belief that there is no need for rules. endTok	38.6932036035003
startTok We need to gain an insight into what companies are like now. endTok	86.90255932471943
startTok At present, we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with a Rhineland tradition. endTok	55.826717311471086
startTok What remains of the concept of what a company should be like now is naturally very relevant: whether it is merely the property and toy of shareholders, or whether it is a more broadly based stakeholder society, which is meant to guarantee continuity for staff, consumers, suppliers and the local population and has, in addition, a social function. endTok	75.17573532108028
startTok As such, I would like to ask these various Commission directorates and these various Commissioners to provide a wider vision regarding corporate governments. endTok	85.41906934190821
startTok I think that it would also fit in well with the plans which have been presented over the past couple of days on good government in Europe, as company policy forms part of this. endTok	49.3601401528353
startTok The government is talking to trade union and Goodyear delegates in Italy as well, in an endeavour to find a solution to the closure policy unilaterally adopted by the North American multinational in Cisterna di Latina, an area of Central Italy which has already been affected by other restructuring operations. endTok	84.93258420416134
startTok The closure means the direct or indirect loss of more than a thousand jobs and hundreds of families being abandoned to insecurity and sudden poverty. endTok	109.11890133246955
startTok The Goodyear workers are putting up a magnificent fight, in the knowledge that they are defending not only their own interests but the interests of the Goodyear workers in the different European countries as well, and there are many of them: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Luxembourg and Slovenia. endTok	57.25182973475099
startTok Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery, anxious to find out what their future will be, what solidarity the European Union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits. endTok	107.87828173180189
startTok The European Union, in all of its aspects, must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes. endTok	64.55097336246675
startTok Mr President, earlier this week President Prodi announced that one of the Commission' s strategic objectives for the next five years would be to aim for full employment. endTok	23.04440023613707
startTok He acknowledged that 15 million Europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion. endTok	54.68191490568799
startTok What is more, the Portuguese Presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority. endTok	86.85504251040727
startTok Yet, all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies. endTok	69.73702809263219
startTok The Commission' s decision to allow the ABB-Alsthom merger to go ahead is a case in point. endTok	42.752211422794325
startTok The new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings. endTok	61.99041819630488
startTok This global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to 12 000 jobs. endTok	52.627282448744225
startTok In my region of the UK in particular the employment consequences of this merger have been severe as a result of ABB-Alsthom having announced that it was cutting 270 jobs in Britain with 95 jobs being lost in Stafford and 112 in Rugby. endTok	54.650712791630276
startTok The company' s failure to inform the works council about the proposals for the merger is particularly worrying. endTok	73.55344292481183
startTok It is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee. endTok	47.33110644049825
startTok Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation, adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States. endTok	117.87999890614361
startTok I do not think it is simply a matter of a Community charter. endTok	18.16496334863584
startTok EU legislation on this issue could not be clearer. endTok	74.89840127266903
startTok The Commission would do well in this sort of situation to make its decisions not simply on the basis of whether a merger will distort competition but also on the basis of the social and economic consequences. endTok	39.54903347851893
startTok We need more joined-up policy making on these issues. endTok	81.94562579675498
startTok What we also need urgently is an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation. endTok	125.39916390525632
startTok This is the only way of respecting Article 127 of the Treaty. endTok	13.696519146219863
startTok I welcome the statement made by Commissioner Liikanen, but I also look for the support of this Parliament to ensure that the legislation which we have passed on workers' rights is implemented rigorously and to ensure that impact assessments on the workforce for proposed mergers are undertaken as a matter of course. endTok	47.9456040625124
startTok I have received seven motions for resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure. endTok	23.290505267551005
startTok That concludes the debate. endTok	29.09378695997705
startTok The vote will be taken later this evening. endTok	23.65966333912704
startTok The sitting was suspended at 3.50 p.m. and resumed at 4.05 p.m. endTok	8.481828925147319
startTok TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE endTok	78.25143574487078
startTok The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance. endTok	10.947099249884836
startTok Racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain) endTok	44.24383347852061
startTok The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: endTok	8.665793856228088
startTok B5-0149/2000 by Mr Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on outbreaks of racism and xenophobia in the El Ejido area in Spain; endTok	10.37652666383838
startTok B5-0159/2000 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr Sánchez García, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain); endTok	9.279146896036977
startTok B5-0162/2000 by Mrs Díez González and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the outbursts of racism and xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain); endTok	8.603031401921571
startTok B5-0169/2000 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on outbursts of xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain); endTok	6.929720681191926
startTok B5-0175/2000 by Mr Bautista Ojeda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on xenophobia-related incidents in El Ejido (Spain). endTok	12.344952209060384
startTok Mr President, I am reassured by the fact that the first three speakers in this debate are intimate with this situation given our African origin. endTok	32.76649001515428
startTok I must firstly congratulate the groups in this House on the high degree of consensus achieved in the motion for a resolution. I am aware of the efforts made by Members to avoid using an issue such as this for electoral purposes. endTok	44.25372912668747
startTok Secondly, I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia is xenophobic or racist. Of course this does not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law, and by the law alone. endTok	68.39719283037162
startTok We should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner. endTok	36.06966039740879
startTok These events, which are unfortunately overshadowing the political decisions in this area, confirm without doubt that the development of the Tampere Agreements and Title IV of the EC Treaty must be an urgent priority. endTok	54.46699017872479
startTok Today' s problems cannot be solved in five years. endTok	33.19752289983883
startTok They will take a long time, as we are finding out. endTok	54.57486720423191
startTok The legislation of the Member States must be brought into line with the agreements of the governments in Tampere, as paragraph 7 of the motion states. endTok	44.78118581199497
startTok Legal immigrants must be integrated socially without any excuses or delays. endTok	121.06245992108047
startTok Furthermore, the labour market must be organised realistically so that jobs held by third country nationals are subject to labour legislation on wages, social security and social protection in terms of equality. This will eradicate the labour exploitation and markets in marginalised people, which are resulting in the events condemned by the motion, and which are the real basis of the current social problem. endTok	63.874635394185624
startTok Solidarity, dialogue and agreements between local, regional, national and European institutions and employers, unions and the immigrant communities themselves, whose countries of origin must also undoubtedly assume some responsibility, are essential. endTok	177.65312895323808
startTok Collaboration with the countries of origin on this issue is vital. In this respect, the action plans approved by the High Level Group and the Tampere European Council must be allocated a budget. endTok	46.68265037756104
startTok Specifically, I must stress in this debate the plan for Morocco. This is a country with which the European Union has an effective relationship and common interests and which should take particular priority in mutual cooperation and collaboration. endTok	49.298806217688984
startTok Finally, this House must tackle the phenomenon of immigration with sufficient calm to avoid increasing tension in a debate which must go much further than the appropriate words and condemnations prompted by such behaviour. endTok	93.39747220672074
startTok This is a very important social debate in the creation of a European area in which the right to freedom, security and justice will be recognised in the future Charter of Fundamental Rights. endTok	21.361748667829254
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, whenever a serious social problem occurs, it always has a political basis. This is true of the disgraceful events which have recently occurred in El Ejido. endTok	54.86437418090287
startTok The proof of this lies in the fact that the groups in this House have reacted and tabled several motions for resolutions. endTok	44.8845375832976
startTok We all regret the deaths which have occurred and the violent and disproportionate reactions against the immigrant workers. endTok	50.37645757761512
startTok We all, I believe, agree in our condemnation of the xenophobia and racism which was apparent in certain actions. endTok	105.6477528030489
startTok These events certainly have their origin in, among other factors, the absence of a clear immigration policy allowing the affected communities to live together respectfully and peacefully. endTok	76.6910200156568
startTok We hope that the events in El Ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeated. endTok	37.08737004605336
startTok Yet it is not enough to regret the situation. endTok	29.281885984122876
startTok We do not want Africa to become our cross, in fact quite the contrary. endTok	107.2332011365787
startTok We must therefore act. endTok	31.104222989545768
startTok I should like to highlight certain measures which we are trying to introduce in another European region affected by immigration - the Canary Islands. endTok	53.86292145187358
startTok Firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for minors. endTok	49.3218724723121
startTok Secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration. endTok	43.5523615594736
startTok Thirdly we are carrying out education programmes on tolerance and respect. endTok	95.82077274803066
startTok Finally we are producing a census of immigrants. endTok	41.21752323803966
startTok I hope that these measures will help towards ensuring compliance with the Tampere Agreements on immigration and the new Spanish Act on aliens. In particular they must ensure that people arriving in Europe do not lose their dignity. endTok	60.024698933151946
startTok Mr President, last week, in the Andalusian town of El Ejido, we saw scenes which were inappropriate to the European Union in the year 2000. endTok	25.414735691847536
startTok This was acknowledged by the Commission President, Romano Prodi, on 9 February when he confirmed that what had occurred in El Ejido went against the very principles of the European Union. endTok	35.11577619091916
startTok These events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism, xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated. endTok	143.018170313458
startTok It is incomprehensible that ways of coexisting and ensuring mutual respect cannot be found between two communities which are mutually beneficial. endTok	65.96961138429785
startTok The only way to prevent these events happening again, in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers, is through social integration. This requires a firm economic, political and social commitment from the competent authorities. endTok	73.30051134982926
startTok We are all immigrants. endTok	44.76473609064672
startTok For generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly migrated. endTok	95.1667110746615
startTok Geographical mobility is not an invention of the twentieth century and neither are its economic and work-related causes. endTok	81.51622950620528
startTok We are all immigrants, if not ourselves personally, then through one of our relations or ancestors. endTok	140.48862624558618
startTok However, instead of producing these events which we are condemning, migration must generate social, cultural and economic enrichment. endTok	75.77141562290045
startTok What happened in El Ejido is unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the European Union. endTok	28.677674196035717
startTok We must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of El Ejido against immigrant workers in the area. A whole community should not have been held responsible, criminalised and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident. endTok	73.33788499806785
startTok Secondly, all the authorities must act immediately. Coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism. endTok	79.85951676565274
startTok In particular, local authorities and mayors have a direct responsibility to prevent any demonstration of racism or xenophobia, especially when this involves violent and aggressive acts against people and their property. endTok	81.68486613740357
startTok These authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these, as has happened with the mayor in question. endTok	44.269210020586094
startTok Thirdly, the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials. They must prevent any individual action or declaration which is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the European Union. endTok	67.28258290656095
startTok Finally, the European Union must be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles. endTok	30.536601111722952
startTok It must prevent any racist or xenophobic demonstrations in its territory and support and collaborate with national, regional and local authorities and non-governmental organisations and associations in the application of these principles. This must occur within a framework of constant action to combat racism and xenophobia and to encourage the integration of all immigrants resident in the EU. endTok	48.19830104616338
startTok Mr President, initially our Group did not fully understand the need to table this motion for a resolution on events which seemed to be a local phenomenon. endTok	41.746656241383484
startTok However, the incidents in El Ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout Europe and which deserves our full attention. endTok	41.26168987330062
startTok We thought we had eradicated the terror of intolerance which racism had unleashed in Europe. Yet, over the years, social disintegration in Europe has been combining with an increase in migration from surrounding countries and increased awareness of human rights to develop into this climate of racism and intolerance. endTok	80.22768235409869
startTok This is why what seemed to be a local and isolated phenomenon in El Ejido is actually a worrying symptom which is coinciding with the emergence of parties like Haider' s. endTok	52.8805553694889
startTok This House therefore proposes the adoption of urgent measures encompassing all the relevant factors and to be applied immediately. We must ensure respect for human rights, tolerance and multiculturalism and we must obtain an increase in budgets and action lines for social and health issues. endTok	73.62636076935844
startTok In this respect we must not forget that the original victim' s attacker was suffering from a mental illness for which he had been inadequately treated. endTok	28.13796070137574
startTok The current difficulties must also be taken into account so that this town can adopt the necessary measures, as indicated previously. endTok	54.14711544840907
startTok Finally, as our Nobel Prize Winner, José Saramago, has said, we are all in each other and as Jesus Christ said, although Saramago disagreed with this, we should not just love one another, more importantly, we should respect one another. endTok	64.17121934570606
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, Andalusia is one of the most tolerant and multiracial regions of the European Union. endTok	10.476307985653582
startTok Since time immemorial it has welcomed all those who have decided to move there and regarded them as Andalusians from day one, whether or not they were born in our region. Therefore, as an MEP, but primarily as an Andalusian, I can feel only sadness, repugnance and condemnation for the xenophobic and racist events which have occurred and which are foreign to this tolerant community. endTok	108.28248393296136
startTok Yet a worrying situation is apparent. endTok	137.8359887837342
startTok All decisions which are or are not taken and all agreements which are or are not negotiated by the Community institutions with regard to the economy of the principal sectors in disadvantaged areas like Andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incidents. I am referring, for example, to the lack of agreement with Morocco and to the lack of solutions for the fishing industry, part of whose fleet is moored in Almería. endTok	67.26769811753744
startTok I am also referring to the erratic management of the import scheme for fruit and vegetables by the EU which is dominating relations between Almería and Morocco. I am also referring to the immigration policy of the regions, Member States and European Union which, due to actions or omissions, is leading to a few territories like Almería having to support this migratory pressure from north-west Africa on their own. endTok	54.313854861101184
startTok All these factors have unfortunately been accumulating over time and are now allowing those who are cruel, intolerant, racist and destructive, of which all our countries have some examples, but thankfully a minority, to light the fuse of xenophobia. endTok	73.7739612163978
startTok Anyone, whether European or not, who lives and works in Andalusia, is an Andalusian and deserves our consideration and respect. The EU can and must speak out. endTok	213.171859789005
startTok For you, the south is Andalusia but for us Andalusians it is Africa. endTok	209.1200277167373
startTok We must therefore ensure that the EU provides every possible resource so that the economy of the south can prosper and enable a society to develop with more tolerance and respect for one another. This has not been achieved with the solutions proposed to date which have quite simply been based on looking the other way. endTok	79.58372379580217
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, I speak from experience acquired during many visits to El Ejido over the years. I was therefore aware how the situation was developing. endTok	73.2473680119266
startTok Here in the European Parliament, as in many other institutions, we have watched this situation with concern and were beside ourselves when we heard what had happened. This is because we felt the problem to be ours, as it was. endTok	73.53359427708602
startTok In El Ejido there is a serious social problem, problems of integration and employment and also a grave problem of public safety which acted as the detonator. endTok	58.896874285274116
startTok These events have also acted as a wake-up call to our consciences. endTok	49.4151526316845
startTok Here in this House, in Spain and in many other countries, we have all fixed on El Ejido. Yet what we do and say here and the concern we express will really serve no purpose unless this leads to the adoption of a much more determined attitude to finding out what is really happening, not only in El Ejido, but in many other places where this type of problem may be occurring at any given moment. endTok	79.39825834415
startTok We all agree in our condemnation of intolerance and we also agree that we must look forward. We will not find the guilty parties in this House or in many other places. endTok	41.99977338683586
startTok Those responsible for what happened in El Ejido are a minority who set out to satisfy their desire for vengeance on the immigrants. We must bear in mind that vengeance is not a solution. endTok	52.69716720205787
startTok These problems can only be solved by close cooperation between all the authorities in order to achieve social integration and respect for all working there. This therefore requires a determined fight against illegal immigration and profound respect for the rights of immigrant workers who are legally working in El Ejido and throughout Europe. endTok	69.23449610630985
startTok Mr President, this resolution expresses solidarity with the democratic forces in Spain fighting for human rights. endTok	68.08773280588429
startTok All the Spanish democrats wounded by what is happening in their country have our full and complete support. endTok	82.54734766395696
startTok It was not only immigrants who were the victims of atrocities; the democratic system in Spain has been held up to ridicule, despite having demonstrated its tremendous capacity to evolve over the last 20 years. endTok	72.42263319130807
startTok Employers would be lost without immigrants. endTok	223.3427570813626
startTok Working conditions are so hard and so deplorable that no Spaniard will accept them. endTok	73.52770383660534
startTok Low wages, the lack of housing - some are living in cardboard huts - the lack of access to social services and the de facto system of apartheid are abominable and unacceptable and are not worthy of the respect which every human being deserves. endTok	74.71013798669472
startTok What happened at El Ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in Europe today. endTok	41.209004089339615
startTok For four days, the immigrants were collectively hounded. endTok	107.58218651381976
startTok Women and children were beaten. endTok	40.39254964840775
startTok Fleeing from all quarters, hundreds of immigrants took refuge on a hill on the outskirts of the town. endTok	52.239363256442914
startTok We are right to blacklist Haider' s Austria; but we cannot allow little local Haiders to practice policies of racial exclusion and merciless economic domination. endTok	114.60280085616994
startTok What happened in Spain could happen in any country in the Union if we are not careful. endTok	47.64782595200305
startTok We all have a duty to put our own house in order. endTok	23.905025684236445
startTok I support this proposal for a resolution, especially the points which refer to the application of Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, and point 11 of this resolution establishing a link between the Structural Funds allocated and the fight against exclusion. endTok	41.52884375345185
startTok It would be to our credit were the European Parliament to roundly condemn these events and support all proposals tabled in order to ensure that the rights of immigrants in Spain and throughout the Union are respected. endTok	63.4331896652529
startTok Mr President, acts of racist and xenophobic violence are taking hold at the heart of Europe. endTok	41.82716540855886
startTok Everywhere this violence is exacerbated by the spread of extremist movements. endTok	140.837541816771
startTok We must take practical steps today to put an end to all attacks of a physical nature. endTok	50.52074397229823
startTok No European society can truly flourish when it harbours the risk of seeing one section of its population fall prey to the hatred of the other. endTok	55.69340279353223
startTok Having received a delegation from the Austrian human rights association here yesterday and having seen what has happened in the province of Almería, it is easy to understand that we could easily have prevented this resurgence of racist hatred. endTok	59.07280330384078
startTok These violent scenes at El Ejido are so similar to archive pictures of Alabama in the 1950s, when the KKK terrified the black population, that it is hard to tell them apart. They also put us in mind of Germany in the 1930s, when the Nazis were persecuting the Jews. endTok	54.987601617287396
startTok Without wishing to lump everything together hysterically, because each period is different, we have failed to learn the lessons of history. endTok	58.92780312754495
startTok That is my conclusion today. endTok	60.747253908807174
startTok Because this witch hunt which broke out in the province of Almería should have been foreseen. endTok	30.280721480920853
startTok It is the result, first and foremost, of the ghettoisation and exploitation of immigrant labour. endTok	43.365752193117096
startTok Three annual crops of Moroccan and African workers support 100 000 people and manage to bring in an annual turnover of nearly EUR 2 million; and yet 60% of them have no running water in a region where, as we know, the temperature may reach 40 degrees in summer. endTok	98.30563596696985
startTok We also know that many of them only earn EUR 30 a month, while their fellow European citizens can earn three times that. endTok	109.06001706236746
startTok This precarious wage-earning position weakens these immigrants and their families and makes them vulnerable. endTok	122.94651929183449
startTok The irresponsibility of certain elected representatives and the barely disguised complicity of the authorities have contributed to this racist explosion. endTok	66.20337082561939
startTok We should counter such acts of terror, Mr President, by setting up a parliamentary committee of inquiry as quickly as possible so that we can decide how we can succeed in preventing other conflicts of a similar nature elsewhere. My fellow Member, Mrs Roure, was right to remind us just now that we all need to put our own house in order. endTok	61.66579332002068
startTok Finally, and I think this is important: why not have the honesty today to relay what was disclosed in a recent UN study explaining that, if Spain wishes to preserve its work, retirement and pension potential, it is no good just giving 30 000 immigrants a year legal status; it needs to be prepared to accept 12 million immigrants between now and the year 2050? endTok	125.27795829779173
startTok We must insist today as a matter of urgency on the right to education and the duty to remember, to recall the dates in history when our countries teetered on the brink of horror. endTok	56.835012310745284
startTok We need to educate our children on these matters and finally have the courage to recognise that we will need to be prepared to accept many more immigrants in years to come. endTok	40.26637787072696
startTok It just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on Saturday. endTok	59.44607840518625
startTok We must take to the streets of Europe to protest against these alliances with extremists which are a disgrace to Europe and which lead our youth astray. endTok	59.893781740489274
startTok Mr President, since the signature of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union has had responsibility for combating racism and xenophobia. endTok	17.779761529709475
startTok Two types of measure are required for this purpose. The first should seek the integration of people of non-European origin and the other should aim to organise immigration. endTok	97.29715568285393
startTok With regard to the first, the Commission has sent us a series of proposals, contained in two directives and an action plan, which aim to apply the following decision taken by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere. This states that 'The European Union must ensure fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on the territory of its Member States. endTok	47.997735440974765
startTok A more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens' . This is totally contrary to what we have seen and found recently in El Ejido where there are irregularities, labour exploitation and indecent living conditions, which have been condemned in the past. endTok	87.04609593036264
startTok I hope for prompt implementation of the measures to achieve integration. I also hope that the governments which produced such wonderful words in Tampere, including Spain, will work diligently to apply these. endTok	118.1881483326143
startTok I have less hope about the development of an effective and fair European policy in accordance with the statement made by the Council on immigration. endTok	35.31383409600258
startTok The only proposal which has been made is for the directive on family reunification. This is a key issue, as we have seen recently in the media that there are many men on their own in El Ejido. endTok	38.459656322698976
startTok Yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments. Outside the Community arena, some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies. endTok	61.138193454534054
startTok This is occurring in my country, despite the government, the party in power being the only one which does not like the new law on aliens. endTok	60.24612548134888
startTok The objective of combating racism and xenophobia, explained in the Treaties, should be the objective of all European institutions and politicians. endTok	66.65182585668812
startTok On 28 February 1998 the European political parties, including the Spanish Popular Party, signed the Charter of European Political Parties for a Non-Racist Society. endTok	81.70664230161977
startTok This requires coherent behaviour, yet local leaders of the Popular Party are throwing more fuel on the raging fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out. endTok	111.67904645627523
startTok The party to which the Mayor of El Ejido belongs should, according to the commitments signed in this Charter, act forcefully. endTok	108.03729812775228
startTok It is only, as stated by Mr Hernández Mollar, through unity, responsibility and firmness that El Ejido, Spain and Europe will be able to overcome these events of which we are deeply ashamed. endTok	50.55871229215647
startTok Mr President, one cannot but feel disgust and indignation at the scenes of lynching, no less, of Moroccan day labourers which took place in El Ejido. endTok	69.46796474587376
startTok We do not the extent to which far-right commandos were to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commandos were to blame. endTok	97.60877784388828
startTok We wish to assure these Moroccan workers that they have our full support - as if being exploited by unscrupulous employers were not enough, they have to suffer this type of aggression. endTok	70.34178429899927
startTok And if the aggressors include working-class people, all we can say to them is that, in acting in this way, they are digging their own graves. endTok	58.93628962636577
startTok In waging war against people who are as poor as they are, they are only doing their own exploiters a favour and preparing a future of oppression for themselves. endTok	91.69535446473303
startTok But there are some who bear even more responsibility than the thugs who wielded the iron bars and knives: those who spread racist and xenophobic slander, those who indulge in anti-immigration demagoguery in Spain, Austria, France or elsewhere, sometimes even here in this House, are no better than those who take this stupid, reactionary demagoguery at face value. endTok	95.55503807407676
startTok The lynch mob and their extreme right-wing mentors are the mortal enemies not only of the workers, but of society as a whole. endTok	31.55337827912639
startTok . I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable Member on the way in which he introduced this extremely important debate. endTok	15.546810054316454
startTok I want to make it clear at the outset that the Commission unreservedly condemns the dreadful acts of violence at El Ejido against the immigrant workers of the region. endTok	29.84708468715878
startTok We express our support for the families and friends of the victims. endTok	45.47406885204178
startTok President Prodi and Commissioner Diamantopoulou have both issued separate statements. endTok	137.85472177313787
startTok Naturally I completely endorse what they have said. endTok	81.07230382585327
startTok It was especially moving to hear the remarks from Members of Parliament who come from the region about what has happened, uncharacteristically, in a part of Spain that I know reasonably well. endTok	59.54613921447006
startTok Racist and xenophobic acts are wholly unacceptable within our Community, wherever they take place. endTok	82.23415230760911
startTok They fly in the face of the very principles on which - as Mr Havel said yesterday - the European Union was founded: principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights. endTok	53.79297843250516
startTok Of course progress has been made in recent years but we still have to work together towards a climate of tolerance in which racism and xenophobia are regarded as completely beyond the pale, completely unacceptable, while at the same time we deal very robustly with incidents such as the ones we are discussing this afternoon. endTok	48.56534698666135
startTok We need, in our judgement, to focus on a package of measures including: first, the introduction of effective, anti-discrimination legislation at Union level; second, implementation of a common immigration policy with regard to the nationals of non-Member States to promote, in practical terms, the integration of the immigrant population in Member States' societies; third, the introduction of measures to combat social exclusion. endTok	74.51964730302429
startTok The European Union has already laid the basis for Community legislation on combating discrimination on the grounds of race. endTok	34.66881229854717
startTok The insertion of Article 13, which was referred to during the debate, dealing with non-discrimination in the Treaty establishing the European Community, is one of the most significant changes of the last revision of the Treaties. endTok	31.88684330304827
startTok Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force the Commission has presented a package of proposals for the implementation of Article 13 including, in particular, a proposal for a directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment regardless of race or ethnic origin. endTok	24.06919387173838
startTok This proposal is under examination by the Council and the European Parliament. endTok	21.71444391488016
startTok The Commission hopes very much that this stage will soon be complete. endTok	62.52149668968622
startTok The conclusions of the Tampere special European Council, as Mr Hernandez Mollar said, clearly illustrated the will of the Heads of State and Government as regards the introduction of a common policy on immigration and the principles on which it should be based, with particular emphasis on the Union' s policy on the respect and promotion of the rights of migrants. endTok	43.71054254330639
startTok At Tampere the Heads of State and Government also emphasised the importance of approximating national legislation on conditions for admission and residence of third country nationals based on a shared assessment of the economic and demographic developments in the Member States as well as the situation in the countries of origin. endTok	36.7527392731269
startTok The European Council also considered it important to step up the prevention of illegal immigration. endTok	55.00265403274154
startTok Its objective here is to secure the rights of victims of criminal networks organising illegal immigration, with particular reference to the rights of women and children. endTok	104.01043136298922
startTok Those who organise illegal immigration should be prosecuted with the utmost vigour. endTok	79.81623155757141
startTok The word that is used about them in Chinese society is 'snake-heads' . It seems to me a fitting description of them. endTok	80.95583283379186
startTok Let me also draw attention to the work on drawing up a European Union charter on fundamental rights, which has now reached the drafting stage. endTok	28.93204207379902
startTok Those rights are, by definition, universal. endTok	323.04572745720117
startTok The charter will extend to third country nationals in Member States even though certain rights will be reserved to nationals of Member States of the Union. endTok	40.48470134156579
startTok The El Ejido incidents were shocking, as several Members have said in their speeches. endTok	56.219597368934664
startTok But trying to take something positive from them, I hope they will spur us on to translate our aspirations about tolerance, fairness and freedom into real and effective policies that will help to transform the lives of all those families and individuals in the European Union who cry out for our understanding and our help and who deserve it, not at some indefinite moment in the future, but here today. endTok	68.26747836698046
startTok Thank you, Commissioner. endTok	17.829155313593716
startTok The joint debate is closed. endTok	10.970049441828781
startTok The vote will take place at 6 p.m. endTok	7.260383156605772
startTok Human rights endTok	105.32256844666323
startTok Mr President, before we start the debate on Kosovo or Mitrovica, I must inform you that a nasty sense of unease has come over me. endTok	64.80924291369026
startTok Indeed, it is not the first time that we will be debating Kosovo here. endTok	24.56110872056443
startTok We have adopted resolutions in the past but they usually are nothing but a warning shot, as nothing is actually done with them. endTok	70.08906753707164
startTok I very much appreciate it that the Commission always attends. endTok	24.248684294158817
startTok I certainly appreciate the fact that Commissioner Patten is present, given his powers. endTok	44.654899100098014
startTok But I - and many Members with me - also have to note that the Council is consistently absent from this debate. endTok	48.447455195956955
startTok We need to cooperate with the Council too. endTok	21.322049721471366
startTok I see that a diplomat from the Council is present who is diligently taking notes and who will then report to the Council but, for the rest, nothing will get done. endTok	90.45411976003773
startTok I would insist on changing our procedures and on the fact that the Council should be present during the topical debate, so that we can enter into direct consultation with the Council. endTok	36.900253888603785
startTok I think we should give this some thought. endTok	46.81476098271958
startTok I would request you to pass this complaint on to the Bureau of Parliament. endTok	34.918104801710555
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, we have not signed this compromise motion for a resolution for two reasons. endTok	24.10564397615055
startTok First, because Mr Sakellariou, who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote, vehemently vetoed it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender. endTok	84.2106164281809
startTok I have no doubt, and I am sure that you have no doubt, that this is a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance. endTok	23.113477915020788
startTok The other reason is that this text does not, unfortunately, go very far. endTok	50.78105614769028
startTok I think that it manages, through a series of clever devices, to carefully avoid addressing the central issue, i.e. the final status of Kosovo. endTok	46.15643995538017
startTok I doubt that any of you still believe that Kosovo can one day become part of Yugoslavia. endTok	55.686126737469515
startTok I also doubt that any of you can believe that Milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolved the question of the final status of Kosovo. endTok	41.8100164428701
startTok I also doubt that any of you think that, as things stand, it is not in Milosevic' s interest to pull out all the stops and destabilise Kosovo, as he is doing and as we have seen. endTok	38.590599070700115
startTok Finally, I do not think that any of you believe that the present status quo will bring minimum stability and hence minimum development to Kosovo. endTok	41.32358494881159
startTok I also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution, which you no doubt overlooked. endTok	38.74495453164938
startTok You condemn the first direct attack on the KFOR troops. endTok	78.97810528324429
startTok I would not want you to be birds of ill omen, but I fear that, by failing to confront the real issue, you will end up being just that and I shall hold you entirely responsible for what may happen. endTok	80.37755435050053
startTok On the contrary, I think it is our duty to call on the Commission and the Council, which unfortunately is not present, to insist that the United Nations consider the question of the final status of Kosovo, of the multiplicity of micro-states in the region, of what happens post-Dayton and, finally, the question of real stability which can allow democracy to be built up in these countries and give the European Union a policy in this region. endTok	36.86484252828608
startTok Finally, I would stress that we have been asking the Council and the Commission since July to take forceful action to secure the release of the 3 000 Kosovar prisoners and Mrs Brovina, Mr Jurti and Mr Hoti. endTok	42.2974338805167
startTok I note that the Union is preparing to lift certain sanctions and that we have not seen even one of these prisoners released in exchange. endTok	67.63971100428454
startTok Why not? endTok	462.81688807855926
startTok Mr President, what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible. endTok	20.61002439095014
startTok Violence begets violence, and revenge begets revenge. endTok	46.2554218437624
startTok The police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on. endTok	35.38108545496962
startTok The Chief Commissioner of Police, Svend Frederiksen, has expressed his desperation at the fact that he constantly has to make do with less than half the manpower which was agreed. endTok	50.52826066383711
startTok He has fewer than 2 000 officers, and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000. endTok	33.122605908453025
startTok The police force should be large enough for it to be a visible presence, so that people can believe that it is in a position to stop atrocities. It should also be large enough to be able to clear up crimes and punish those who are guilty of them. endTok	33.94436342880963
startTok Otherwise, there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands. It is therefore also important that local officers should be trained, and the idea was, in fact, that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained. endTok	45.45737544800515
startTok However, there are still fewer than 200 trained police officers to contribute to clearing up crime. A year ago, we did of course see what happens when agreements and resolutions which have been made are not followed up. endTok	64.34080973974477
startTok I was in Kosovo on 27 October 1998 when the Serbs withdrew. endTok	81.74148064898444
startTok The agreement was that 1 800 OSCE observers should arrive to guarantee the peace. endTok	77.77824841795383
startTok After a month, however, there was still only a handful of observers. endTok	67.34986214558113
startTok By Christmas, there were perhaps 100 and, by the spring, still only a fraction of the force it had been agreed should come was, in fact, in place. endTok	113.73806882074274
startTok Atrocities were not even being recorded. endTok	155.1107511354463
startTok Then the war came, and the observers were withdrawn. endTok	104.17790307912962
startTok I would therefore ask the Commissioner: can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our follies here in Europe? endTok	35.721414359394885
startTok Can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5 000 officers and training local officers, who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad? endTok	106.33956534444394
startTok I might also ask: when do you anticipate that they will be in place? endTok	32.477047200739605
startTok And when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities? endTok	72.07461160194192
startTok I mention this last issue because it is the solution we should be embracing as quickly as possible if peace is to have any chance at all. endTok	45.88878495911233
startTok All who are in contact with real life in Kosovo share the same opinion: it is a tragic, desperate situation where there is a democratic void and no possibility of the different ethnic groups living peacefully side by side. Mitrovica is a tragic example of this. endTok	64.43445208883242
startTok Before military intervention by NATO, Milosevic' s policy for Kosovo was certainly to be condemned, and the demands of the non-violent forces of the Rugovo era for the Kosovar regions to be autonomous were justified. endTok	62.78933848812891
startTok But NATO' s decision for military intervention and the KLA' s support for the armed forces had a devastating effect and have reduced Kosovo to a colony, as well as destroying civil infrastructures in Serbia. endTok	73.30239880413583
startTok Today, Kosovo has no adequate strategy for protecting minority groups, and these include not only Serbs and Roma, but also moderate Albanians who still believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence and are persecuted by the extremists in power. endTok	68.7523686130789
startTok It is useless to talk of the Roma houses which have been burnt down and the thousands upon thousands of new refugees and the refugees from Krajina, who are now living, barricaded in, in Kosovo, abandoned by the UNHCR, which itself has been abandoned by the donors, while the emergency is still of dramatic proportions. endTok	56.551701827936064
startTok In the joint resolution, we ask the Council and the Member States to double their efforts to ensure respect for minority groups and to work towards the creation of democratic structures, giving a voice to all those forces which still believe in peaceful coexistence. endTok	50.103201655403396
startTok In this sense, I am in agreement with Mr Sakellariou' s proposals. endTok	18.238063458013617
startTok Another subject being discussed is the release of the Albanians held in prisons, particularly Flora Brovina, a woman of extraordinary humanity whom I met, together with the Women in Black of Belgrade, during joint attempts to build bridges between women from different ethnic groups. endTok	122.40367687859779
startTok Flora defended herself, and asked Serbs and Albanians to shake hands. endTok	112.18502498894067
startTok Flora Brovina' s husband is the guest of Serbian women in Belgrade. endTok	39.61270365183572
startTok This is a sign of hope, the hope that it possible to act differently even in Serbia. endTok	62.76703693375765
startTok It is not true that Flora Brovina has been abandoned. endTok	16.67400830531058
startTok She might well have been abandoned by the large institutions, but we, who worked in Kosovo and Serbia for many years, are doing our utmost to campaign for her release. endTok	76.66049087187051
startTok I believe that the European Union must do likewise. endTok	10.755497229933518
startTok The embargo on Serbia must be lifted and Serbia must, in turn, release its political prisoners. endTok	57.93139204938609
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to fully endorse Mrs Pack' s very emotionally-charged contribution. endTok	17.190255947131174
startTok What she has said here is completely justified. endTok	47.995217925585344
startTok There is not one truth in Kosovo, there are several. endTok	53.002625179571844
startTok I refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse - that is bending the truth. endTok	37.59977950355314
startTok I completely concur with the draft resolution which is before us. endTok	32.58020206831066
startTok We condemn all violence over there and that is what we need to do, but we cannot talk about genocide in reverse. endTok	45.71438267180229
startTok Needless to say, the situation in Mitrovica is very dangerous and we all know why. endTok	30.602903632549907
startTok There are also important economic interests at stake and the whole tragedy surrounding the Trepca mines also plays its part. endTok	62.03160802808116
startTok We have already talked about the fate of the political prisoners. endTok	19.439648549779186
startTok There is a great deal of pain, a lot of suffering in Kosovo. endTok	21.990777047276108
startTok The people are holding demonstrations, they are sending us e-mails. endTok	97.9078114719888
startTok They ask us where their children are, their sons. endTok	63.61921057178181
startTok We need to be able to go back with a proper answer. endTok	20.012378430916147
startTok The case of Flora Brovina is just one of many. endTok	44.159167525252364
startTok We are right to include this in the draft resolution, but there are hundreds, even thousands of Flora Brovinas out there. endTok	45.66021327773545
startTok I would ask the Commission and the absent Council at long last to do something for these political prisoners. endTok	37.12783686996407
startTok The fact that they are locked up in Serbia also fuels the unrest and violence in Kosovo. endTok	23.71075166968526
startTok Mr President, in the present joint draft resolution, paragraph 10 urges the Council and Member States - rightly so - to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the UN police units. endTok	54.28780685180377
startTok This request is fully in line with the vision held by the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo, Mr Bernard Kouchner. endTok	39.41746055655643
startTok In order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in Kosovo, he needs, by his own reckoning, at least 6 000 foreign police officers. endTok	87.23607208769013
startTok The UN, however, have pledged to dispatch a police force of 4 800. endTok	53.81610732094836
startTok To date, however, Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal. endTok	81.86450778060029
startTok Moreover, half of this group is from the United States and Germany. endTok	63.227268277163304
startTok It is logical that the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo is extremely dissatisfied with this situation, especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region. endTok	22.832104308400655
startTok What is disconcerting, however, is Mr Kouchner' s sharp criticism levelled at the French Government these days. endTok	55.62407991487417
startTok Paris is leaving its fellow-countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen, not more than 37, in the crisis region. endTok	60.23799612154046
startTok For this hardly honourable position, Mr Kouchner blames none other than the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Chevènement. endTok	91.72898419563697
startTok According to Mr Kouchner, the Minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the French police officials on ideological grounds. endTok	58.026274686271485
startTok I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome. endTok	35.567450988423545
startTok Press freedom in Angola endTok	275.00947549991156
startTok Mr President, I do not intend to repeat the premise put forward earlier for fear of being accused of improper publicity. endTok	30.805731427626295
startTok On the question of Angola, I think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last. endTok	36.66245602554681
startTok It would be the first in a long time. endTok	21.349401620909788
startTok So I welcome it as such. endTok	87.43388367578181
startTok I think that the European Union and the western world in general has had Mr Savimbi in their crossfire for some time now, with no discrimination whatsoever, but corruption is now so rife in Mr Dos Santos' s regime that even his long-standing friends are starting to find it hard to pretend not to see anything. endTok	66.52951369816707
startTok So I think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter, especially the worrying things which we are discussing, particularly logistics support for the information services by the United States and Great Britain, generalised corruption in the regime linked to multinational oil companies and numerous other extremely 'spicy' matters which we need to go into. endTok	62.9962066378876
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has rightly led the way in promoting human rights in the European Union. endTok	15.829645048199106
startTok Clearly, governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial, geostrategic or economic interests. endTok	78.64540672835923
startTok We have established requirements for the countries which want to join our Union and we must also establish requirements for the countries which we support, because we believe in democracy and its values. endTok	52.30246015972954
startTok A free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy. endTok	97.88479793839781
startTok There can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion. endTok	92.83663638874383
startTok Yet the latter cannot exist without free and unrestricted social communication which itself cannot exist when journalists are persecuted, detained, threatened or put under pressure. endTok	181.12938269874593
startTok We rightfully condemned the behaviour of UNITA which threatened the peace process in Angola and we used our authority to invite the two sides to stop the war and embrace peace. Rightfully and with the full weight of our authority, we condemn the persecution and threats against journalists and we call on the Government of Angola to ensure the conditions of freedom which are essential to the vital work of journalists in a democratic country and society. endTok	70.34839229993807
startTok Mr President, how much longer can we continue our cooperation with Angola? endTok	105.70786939223252
startTok Human rights are being violated consistently and have been for a long period of time, not only by UNITA, but also by the government itself. endTok	39.550570471956014
startTok The legal proceedings against the journalists fly in the face of every legal principle. endTok	97.11008593659717
startTok The Angolan Government must immediately authorise a substantial UN presence which can mediate and can report on human rights. endTok	72.58173225088602
startTok Additionally, European observers will need to be admitted to the trials against the journalists. endTok	52.3747855347499
startTok Europe, as a major donor, has so far remained too passive with regard to Angola. endTok	46.473342563878546
startTok If the Angolan Government continues to refuse to cooperate, measures will need to be taken. endTok	48.48524095258674
startTok Without national reconciliation, reconciliation with Europe is not possible. endTok	104.45202695827356
startTok This being the case, Angola will unfortunately remain a very rough diamond. endTok	81.52905760465393
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the motion for a resolution being discussed by this House. The repression of both Angolan and foreign journalists in Angola is scandalous and so serious that we cannot let it pass without comment. endTok	50.937539492863515
startTok However, this motion is inadequate as it actually starts from the principle that Angola enjoys rule of law and is only imposing certain restrictions on journalists and restraining them. endTok	72.70442327197871
startTok Yet this is not the situation. endTok	28.05731151408279
startTok Angola does not enjoy rule of law. It is a repressive dictatorship. endTok	89.96160540685497
startTok It is at war, and a bloody war at that, which is dragging on and on. endTok	79.33660828618106
startTok The prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept. endTok	35.633656069767056
startTok The repeated appeals made by the Angolan church and, for example, by Mr Mandela and Mr Mbeki, for new negotiations to try and achieve peace must be supported by this House. endTok	36.27978400289814
startTok As another Member said, we must have a general debate on Angola and not just on the situation of certain journalists suffering repression in this country. endTok	56.37064624873532
startTok For example, I have today received information directly from Rafael Marques, whose situation we are discussing, according to which two correspondents from Portuguese television have been imprisoned in Angola. endTok	75.387527949221
startTok These cases keep occurring. endTok	320.69962952049985
startTok Yet the worst part is that there is no way out of the situation in Angola. endTok	33.50823499096985
startTok The silence of the major powers and our own silence are questionable and are benefiting a regime of corruption, violence and war. endTok	105.79566169972452
startTok I must draw attention to the fact that the war in Angola is spreading to other parts of Africa. endTok	19.817787539947652
startTok It is impacting on the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and on the situations in Namibia and Zambia. It is now also affecting the situation in Zimbabwe where Robert Mugabe has just lost the referendum precisely because he has sent troops to the Congo to prop up Laurent Kabila who is beyond salvation. endTok	37.91009472504507
startTok There are two sides in Angola or rather two armed groups. endTok	117.00883792402281
startTok The first is the MPLA, which controls the oil profits. The second is the armed band of Mr Savimbi, which controls the diamond profits. endTok	71.49292430539431
startTok It is oil and diamonds which are financing the continuation of the war which, as has been said, is terrible. It has displaced millions of people and caused them to go hungry. endTok	56.599640633402565
startTok It has led to a critical and tragic situation in Angola. endTok	33.31166959786569
startTok This war must be stopped. endTok	36.180137300463805
startTok The authority of this House could play an important part if we were to have a major debate on the Angolan situation and also on the whole of southern Africa. endTok	27.5135516062631
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution before us today is important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom. It is also very important because of the broad consensus which has finally been reached after some heated discussions behind the scenes. endTok	35.97457033485495
startTok The problem considered by the motion is a major one but, as has already been touched upon, could be regarded as minor in light of the even greater problem of the general situation in Angola which is experiencing a terrible humanitarian disaster. endTok	54.36241102410627
startTok This situation, as in neighbouring former Zaire, is like a festering wound in which it is not clear who is infecting whom. As Mr Soares just said, a truly terrible situation is developing in Angola and in other countries in the region. endTok	60.40724377881436
startTok This was appropriately described a few weeks ago as the First World War of Africa, given the involvement of certain countries in others. endTok	58.98810624423659
startTok This is a major issue because the Angolan State and authorities must assume their responsibilities. The international community and the European Union must spell this out very clearly. endTok	43.854688888994694
startTok These journalists are professionals who are trying to inform the public in their country and denounce the corruption existing in this regime, for which they are being persecuted. endTok	77.87451306920926
startTok It is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in Angola. endTok	37.17643939206357
startTok We have experienced this in our own national and European history. People can only enjoy lasting peace if they are living in a free and pluralist society where everyone is mutually tolerant. endTok	61.79306972504202
startTok The cause of these journalists is therefore one which we must embrace, although bearing in mind that the problem goes much wider and much deeper and is much more terrible. endTok	57.17745882680115
startTok Like a previous speaker, I also fully support the appeals which have been made. endTok	41.72770969029842
startTok We must, some time soon, find the courage to tackle the whole Angolan problem more broadly and more vigorously. endTok	70.22813671925394
startTok In recent years, the behaviour of UNITA has merited our reservations and criticisms but this cannot be used to excuse the Angolan State for having established a disastrous war economy with widespread corruption resulting in the continued suffering of its people. endTok	88.12631735384335
startTok We must establish dialogue with other forces in Angola, be attentive to the appeals of the Angolan church and encourage the emergence of other national institutions, national reconciliation and new cultural and political forces not engaged in war. These can then eventually free this country and this people from the armed fate which they have been experiencing for decades. endTok	97.62790909381069
startTok The people of Angola deserve better. endTok	83.91611563921937
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems as if the world is turned upside down. endTok	21.539210146539926
startTok Journalists are sent to prison for simply speaking the truth, whilst soldiers who are supposedly fighting each other exchange smuggled goods in the bar in the evening. endTok	133.2226958523426
startTok This is Angola' s reality. endTok	38.70872346562588
startTok We are now expressing our horror concerning this war. endTok	65.03281240144574
startTok Three million victims, two million driven from their homes within the country' s borders, hundreds of thousands driven away across its borders, including women and children. endTok	100.57207683279114
startTok This is a war which transcends its borders. It is not just UNITA which is to blame. endTok	26.97344149609427
startTok The government too is responsible for this continuing violence. This is why we insist that the journalists - more than 20 were imprisoned last year - keep speaking their minds. endTok	105.38561556080603
startTok We would, at the same time, like to insist on other things. endTok	28.696948154206254
startTok We want the UN embargo, which is supposed to prevent a large proportion of arms and ammunition from being flown across to UNITA airports, to stop. endTok	45.69030187696967
startTok But what do these sanctions mean? endTok	136.5703135540235
startTok It is the western world itself which is partly to blame. endTok	35.34812641466327
startTok It is we, our own people, who keep the war going over there. endTok	121.71293813979496
startTok The so-called civilised world should hang its head in shame. endTok	57.169770800681356
startTok This is also the case for the so-called statutory government which is just as guilty, because if this journalist has accused the President himself of deriving benefit from this civil war, then all he is doing is voicing what the entire world knows already and which is being passed on to every tribal district across Africa. endTok	68.3023835356978
startTok Mr President, we are partly to blame for this war. endTok	18.36930397509074
startTok We should stop financing this regime and we should certainly stop supplying arms for the war. endTok	73.08994649256394
startTok Mr President, the facts are well-known. endTok	19.776572379346405
startTok On 24 December, the Angolan court sentenced a correspondent of the Portuguese paper, Expresso, to a year' s imprisonment and a fine of USD 20 000. endTok	65.95869679087964
startTok The journalist had brought to light a corruption scandal in the President' s cabinet. endTok	82.18605288848723
startTok The trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness. endTok	87.57884075701544
startTok Another journalist was threatened with his life during a parliamentary debate last month by a member of parliament of the MPLA government party. endTok	68.945341418505
startTok These are only two examples of a trend in Angola to silence any government critics. endTok	94.39329969011322
startTok Over the past year, more than twenty journalists have been arrested for alleged slander or criminal offences against state security. endTok	80.39369163915065
startTok Their only crime was to criticise what human rights organisations have been denouncing all along, namely the large-scale corruption and disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars, paid by the oil companies to the Angolan Government. endTok	88.12472053600668
startTok Even the British Minister, Peter Hain, conceded this recently. We should ensure that the oil revenue is not used merely to finance the war or to line the pockets of prominent members of government, he told President Dos Santos last month. endTok	80.56603724551805
startTok But, at the same time, we note that Great Britain and also Portugal are continuing to channel military aid to the government. endTok	40.97547975671998
startTok There is indeed a great deal of hypocrisy regarding Angola. endTok	33.99180515106549
startTok On the basis of a report, the human rights organisation Global Witness concluded that the western world is turning a blind eye to the activities of Dos Santos because it is fishing for lucrative oil contracts. endTok	49.54877011720329
startTok I would like to challenge Portugal to deliver proof to the contrary, by making commercial interests subservient to human rights, to which so much lip service is being paid. endTok	69.95080742673974
startTok In my opinion, Angola is a test case. endTok	29.160502285345046
startTok We should, at any rate, judge the Portuguese Presidency on its actions and not on its words. endTok	53.79045191847861
startTok Native Americans in the US - Dineh endTok	75.41154475384792
startTok Mr President, the American leaders do not seem to have learnt a great deal from the criticism of how they treated the Indians and other indigenous peoples. endTok	46.565720477045836
startTok We have to admit that our European sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect. endTok	32.17285930933461
startTok Once again, an indigenous people' s right of existence is being threatened. endTok	64.32062540793842
startTok Once again, the individuality, dignity and health of a people are being sacrificed to the higher economic interest. endTok	50.6689951486555
startTok Once again, we are losing a piece of our planet' s cultural and ecological heritage, despite the many treaties and resolutions on human rights, on the protection of minorities, rights of indigenous peoples, etc., which have already been ratified. endTok	56.98401914111646
startTok If tradition and culture have to make way for economic imperatives at all, we should at least give sufficient attention to the reception and reintegration of the peoples concerned. endTok	43.279185865991636
startTok But if we are to believe the environmental movements, even this is vain hope. endTok	96.4765233959126
startTok There are hardly any reintegration programmes for people who have been relocated to the so-called New Lands. endTok	32.41191543133581
startTok It very much remains to be seen whether these New Lands will be safe in terms of public health. endTok	32.159200857606294
startTok It is of key importance that the American authorities provide greater clarity regarding the way in which they are trying to offer these families a dignified alternative in keeping with a traditional way of life. endTok	45.14297695995179
startTok It is also important that a debate is held where the long-term effects of mining in this region are discussed and weighed up in economic, ecological and social terms. endTok	43.147031850612706
startTok The credibility of the industrialised north is at stake. endTok	34.10665807352599
startTok Indeed, what right do we have to demand of developing countries that they give their minorities a voice, that they protect their valuable natural areas and that they respect human rights, if it transpires that we are unable to meet these demands in our own countries? endTok	72.55913565655766
startTok Mr President, as Mr Van Hecke rightly pointed out, this is about human rights and about the rights of indigenous peoples, and Parliament must speak up, especially vis-à-vis good friends, and the United States is a good friend. endTok	41.78328008721461
startTok This is about the repression of a minority which unfortunately goes back a long time. endTok	48.612994282328316
startTok It is up to the European Parliament to protect vulnerable people. endTok	25.829396504954847
startTok So we need to do this. endTok	15.430123769514836
startTok This is also about respecting a culture, a language, a way of life and a people' s religion, a vulnerable culture which has nearly disappeared. endTok	96.87342851953504
startTok It is important to point this out. endTok	32.510654281187065
startTok This is why it is necessary - and Mr Van Hecke has already mentioned this, and this is also what we clearly ask for in our resolution - that the role of mining in this vulnerable desert area is reassessed. endTok	43.39812597027399
startTok We have just approved the water directive here in Parliament. endTok	79.79823151734676
startTok The water which these people need to exist is under threat because the groundwater strata there are being drilled by a mining company, and this is why the traditional way of life of the people who live there is being threatened. endTok	55.8938140180005
startTok The forced relocation scheme must be stopped unconditionally. endTok	50.803895361934046
startTok People should no longer be forced to move. endTok	38.02590040252437
startTok Over the past 25 years, no less than 25 000 people have been forced to move and this must stop. endTok	36.458477186681705
startTok If people need to move at all, they need to be given a viable alternative. endTok	53.963451816504154
startTok This is not the case here. endTok	13.4795103181087
startTok The area where the people in question are now being taken - and this is also the reason for this resolution - is a polluted area which is economically not suitable. endTok	41.89446320339454
startTok This is why I think that we as European Parliament need to ask the American authorities in any case to suspend the relocation scheme under discussion and, if necessary, abandon the scheme altogether. endTok	37.07702597671743
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my maiden speech and I am delivering it with a great deal of pleasure and conviction as the topic is human rights. endTok	20.836007206349855
startTok In terms of human rights, Europe has a very eventful past and this is why we have become to some extent the cradle of these human rights. endTok	31.211990620315397
startTok We need to continue to stand up for these rights, especially in our own Member States and societies, but also elsewhere. endTok	37.64412605377964
startTok As Mr Sterckx said, we certainly need to do this vis-à-vis the United States which, after all, is close to us in terms of democratic values. endTok	25.655870997947964
startTok The treatment of the Native Americans in many respects flies in the face of the most fundamental human rights. endTok	33.80511091020953
startTok The account of the Dineh Indians is telling. endTok	91.27199579419027
startTok With the discovery and, certainly, the exploitation of black gold - and, later on, uranium and oil - all possible means were used to remove these people from their land and to send them to regions with few prospects other than poverty, hardship and contamination. endTok	92.02795065515055
startTok The area in Arizona which is to be the New Land for the Dineh Indians was hit in 1979 by the worst nuclear disaster in US history. endTok	94.26146684473362
startTok It is now the intention to send the last 4 000 Dineh Indians to this land. endTok	58.57959394593225
startTok The fight of these Indians is being backed by more than 250 NGOs and, thanks to the efforts of the Belgian 'Mother Earth' organisation, we are being kept informed of this situation. endTok	55.382762453317056
startTok This too is characteristic of American society, which hears little about it. endTok	98.29368336974059
startTok They get het up about wars and genocide on other continents, but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country. endTok	86.16803670013859
startTok Today, the Dineh Indians are facing their final fight for their right to land, for their right to dignity and, above all, for their right to their way of life. endTok	79.50138028181065
startTok There are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful, economic adversary. endTok	99.03499668039822
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers, but I would like to emphasise a few things. endTok	11.763248360121763
startTok The Dineh people belong to the North-American Navajo Indians. endTok	38.75554217249163
startTok They are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years. endTok	86.3111009086767
startTok They have been living in harrowing living conditions for years. endTok	46.673213082130836
startTok The deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries. endTok	67.22569202180532
startTok The Relocation Act, which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation, authorised the relocation of the peoples. endTok	48.6703882390181
startTok This relocation is, of course, unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic, social and cultural terms. endTok	37.610798471142225
startTok The Dineh Indians are being moved like pawns and, in that way, lose not only their past and the land which is so extremely important to them - the land of their forefathers - but also any prospect of work and sources of income. endTok	61.38699411089637
startTok The Relocation Act was pushed through in Congress by a group representing the coal mining industry. endTok	77.63059482537236
startTok Congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives. endTok	102.43232799678181
startTok The population was not allowed any input. endTok	71.53875659903734
startTok This resembles a kind of trade in human beings. endTok	49.36710752221609
startTok The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium. endTok	65.9489475286267
startTok After the collapse of the dam in New Mexico in 1979, which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the world' s most contaminated areas. endTok	38.22319884040341
startTok The United States administration, the coal industry and all of us need to acquit ourselves of our responsibility and provide a sound alternative: either the soil is cleaned or the Dineh Indians are allocated a proper place where provision is made for all kinds of support, be it in the psychological, social, cultural or budgetary field. endTok	92.68368392695321
startTok It is high time we respected the rights of the Indians. endTok	43.632056537683
startTok This is why we ask you to vote for this resolution: we in Europe should not be intimidated by American interests which are being pushed by financial, religious and industrial groups. endTok	36.640015980400946
startTok So let us contact the United States now! endTok	47.71869763877398
startTok Madam President, despite the protests by the international press, we still do not know the fate of Mr Andrey Babitsky, the courageous Russian journalist who has worked intensively to ensure free and independent information on the ordeal of the civilian population of Chechnya and the destruction of the city of Grozny. endTok	44.21818683638663
startTok Among the contradictions in the accounts that have been given, there has also been an attempt to reassure international public opinion over Mr Babitsky' s fate, by confirming the theory that there was an exchange of prisoners with Chechen fighters which, inter alia, if this did actually take place, would constitute a breach of international law, which certainly does not provide for the involvement of civilians in such circumstances. endTok	65.06559829803268
startTok Nevertheless, we now have more precise information: we know that the acting Russian President himself, Mr Vladimir Putin, asked Russian special services to safeguard Andrey Babitsky' s life and freedom. endTok	135.59677766952404
startTok This is an admission that confirms all our concerns and makes Parliament' s position on the case all the more appropriate, as it calls for a concurrent explanation of other cases of journalists who have disappeared in the Chechen region during the conflict and the safeguarding of media coverage of a conflict that has reached unacceptable levels of violence. endTok	64.26525839310285
startTok Moreover, we are asking the Russian authorities to provide immediate clarification of conditions in the so-called detention centres, and remind them that those responsible for any arbitrary detention, maltreatment or killing of civilians are laying themselves open to accusations of crimes against humanity. endTok	79.49520132034574
startTok We would ask the Council and the Commission for clear and prompt action and a political initiative which does not overlook the issue of human rights. endTok	31.058152959748238
startTok Mr President, in terms of human rights, there is of course a great deal amiss in Chechnya. endTok	17.500343787588715
startTok We have received reports from human rights organisations saying that Russian soldiers killed and apparently even executed citizens - I am talking about old men and women - in Grozny. endTok	86.17703546865194
startTok Citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air-raid shelters. endTok	53.345619127245605
startTok We insist that these violations of human rights are investigated. endTok	38.9183879518663
startTok Despite the pledges made, violations in, for example, Alfanyurt have still not been investigated. endTok	92.79175952960482
startTok International government organisations and non-governmental organisations must be allowed access, and the Union' s general Council decided on 6 December 1999 to send representatives from the Member States to Ingushetia to study the humanitarian situation there. I am, to say the least, curious to know how they are getting on. endTok	67.54041207785839
startTok The fate of Andrey Babitsky, the correspondent in Grozny of Radio Liberty, who was arrested by Russian troops, is a dramatic example of Russian policy. endTok	67.44650096680977
startTok It contravenes Article 3 of the Geneva Convention of 1949 and is a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press. endTok	37.67902827831256
startTok We want information from the Russian authorities as to Mr Babitsky' s whereabouts and his state of health. endTok	48.77249369187613
startTok Mr President, a journalist is on a fact-finding mission and this calls for freedom. endTok	43.967620465824616
startTok Yet he is taken hostage and treated as a prisoner of war. endTok	43.6840281114135
startTok The war in Chechnya, like any war, is a trail of horrors. endTok	46.09297635122586
startTok The filtration camps are camps in which torture, rape and violations are perpetrated: we know that now. endTok	39.07273166258542
startTok And just what is Mr CFSP doing? endTok	162.91651259003285
startTok Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a full member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, it has been invited to G7 and is a client of the IMF and the World Bank. endTok	32.00030548198404
startTok What are we doing about it? endTok	38.058098614717274
startTok I do not understand why the power centres of Europe are keeping quiet, letting things pass and, by working with the Russians as if nothing were amiss, giving its support to the government which is waging this war. endTok	66.1032490577768
startTok I beg you to intervene. endTok	67.0623425806063
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic case of the courageous Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky illustrates once again the depth of the democratic crisis into which Russia has sunk. endTok	41.29427487251369
startTok The entire Federation is allowing itself to be taken in by the war propaganda. endTok	63.89044494837134
startTok A warlord has become President and he has even been described as a reformer in some western quarters. endTok	67.12277589007866
startTok Journalists, on the other hand, who are simply going about their work in Russia, i.e. endeavouring to produce reports which are as objective as possible, are being treated like criminals. endTok	88.97709718514453
startTok The Russian Government appears to have lost its fundamental understanding of what democracy is about and truth appears to have become a threat in its eyes. endTok	98.07018009497668
startTok I can only reiterate my appeal to the Council and the Commission to stick to the rules. endTok	19.189144901734306
startTok It is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the EU if it does not recognise democratic principles. endTok	51.17061314596938
startTok Mr President, what sort of government hands over one of its own citizens to people whom it itself describes as 'terrorists' and 'bandits' ? endTok	61.60266469971124
startTok Without any hesitation, the Russian Minister for Internal Affairs, Vladimir Rushailo, earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question. endTok	64.25266491720996
startTok The victim of this exchange is said to be the 35-year-old war correspondent of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Andrey Babitsky. endTok	153.64563742941914
startTok I am using the phrase 'is said to be' on purpose, because official Chechen sources are still denying that they would have exchanged Mr Babitsky for a number of Russian prisoners of war. endTok	83.29071307031863
startTok In the meantime, the highest Russian authorities are casting a veil of secrecy over the mysterious disappearance of this courageous journalist. endTok	31.27791013003952
startTok For example, Acting President Vladimir Putin gave an assurance last Monday that he had ordered the country' s security services to bring the missing reporter back to Moscow safely. endTok	92.1856671535062
startTok Russia' s new strong man, however, added a rather puzzling comment to this welcome declaration: 'As far as I am aware, Mr Babitsky already feels free.' endTok	239.230604575559
startTok This distressing ambiguity on the part of the Kremlin is not really surprising. endTok	27.647300797919364
startTok The facts are clear. endTok	61.49627433246897
startTok Andrey Babitsky was an unwanted busybody in Mr Putin' s 'anti-terrorist' operation in Chechnya. endTok	98.23628428671422
startTok Hence his disappearance of over one month. endTok	181.54079397471
startTok In any case, the Babitsky affair warrants one conclusion: the leaders in Moscow cannot possibly maintain that hostage-taking and trading in defenceless citizens is a specifically Chechen crime. endTok	182.2352479841489
startTok This resolution is already the fourth in a row within a short space of time in connection with the Chechen tragedy. endTok	38.73296608968572
startTok Nor is it a mere luxury. endTok	56.92883217904285
startTok Indeed, it is in line with some thirty Russian media bodies which yesterday distributed a special issue on Andrey Babitsky free of charge. endTok	136.24015501939658
startTok Cambodia endTok	2208.8846772960724
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, it is because of my experience in the Balkans, when I was there on duty, that I call on you today to support the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to bring those responsible for the genocide in Cambodia to trial before an independent court under the aegis of the United Nations. endTok	35.82280389831136
startTok I do not think that reconciliation is possible after such murderous tragedies, unless those responsible for starting them are brought to trial and sentenced. endTok	56.842980576720805
startTok Nor do I think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial. endTok	64.04167078569198
startTok I became convinced of this in Sarajevo when I had to negotiate the periodic exchanges of prisoners which accompanied each successive ceasefire agreement, none of which unfortunately lasted, between the parties to the conflict. endTok	114.78782042163293
startTok Every time, just as the exchange was about to take place, we found men missing from the meticulously drawn up lists. endTok	125.35211408400788
startTok Every time, when we asked why, the reply was the same, 'We cannot release him: he is a war criminal' . endTok	110.81180257775937
startTok In the emotion, pain and fury of the agreements, it was impossible to break the vicious circle of blood and vengeance. endTok	24.190322667716618
startTok If we want to help the Cambodians with the task of reconciliation on which they have embarked, we need to try and sentence those responsible at the highest level and thus exonerate the simple underlings and all those who were willingly or forcibly dragged along behind them. endTok	37.91099858291165
startTok I expect Ta Mok and his main lieutenants to be tried and sentenced by the establishment of a tribunal whose impartiality is guaranteed by the United Nations. endTok	35.24498789711744
startTok This will be the only way for the Cambodians to pardon those who simply followed them and to achieve lasting peace. endTok	29.688646894586384
startTok Mr President, it became known this week that two prominent Cambodian opposition papers have been threatened with closure because they are reported to have insulted the king and prime minister. endTok	49.96470577343546
startTok These papers actively support the opposition politician, Mr Sam Rengie. endTok	80.50758796601623
startTok Legal proceedings have been initiated against Sam Rengie himself in order to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be brought to trial for treason. endTok	53.522011667251434
startTok In his millennium speech, he dared to raise the fact that it should become clear what the procedure would be for appointing the successor to King Sihanouk in the event of his death. endTok	46.41666915382261
startTok In March of last year, a member of Sam Rengie' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal. endTok	52.32414977403366
startTok In September, two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a rocket attack on the prime minister. endTok	34.12860435253647
startTok This is notably the only party in Cambodia which has no military arm. endTok	54.765077093353014
startTok In October, a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by uniformed men and not released until the ransom was paid. endTok	56.08590626910318
startTok The pattern of intimidation is clear. endTok	16.412496274200503
startTok There is more going on in Cambodia: prisoners are being tortured, the army and police are involved in the trade in women and children, and people are held on remand to an excessive degree. endTok	93.5359462002021
startTok All this is happening on a daily basis. endTok	29.069221319756213
startTok Even more serious is the government' s refusal to bring the leaders of the Khmer Rouge before an international tribunal. endTok	58.69498663990081
startTok It is true, the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased. endTok	90.92344346676036
startTok The way in which the political opposition is now being treated, however, gives us cause for great concern and, if it carries on like this, it is bound to impact on the Union' s relations with Cambodia. endTok	53.046973654434815
startTok Mr President, there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law, according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes, and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights, not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected. endTok	72.56619417383777
startTok Living examples of this have been the Pinochet-Ugarten case, Kosovo and, in milder form in our own Union, the debate surrounding the government decision in Austria. endTok	132.25996792044
startTok This is what is at stake now in Cambodia unless the leaders of the previous oppressive regime are bought to justice. endTok	59.41467922277403
startTok At the same time, the struggle against impunity is under threat. endTok	16.438327018202365
startTok The situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the Treaty for an International Criminal Court has been shamefully slow. endTok	40.692904222672325
startTok . Mr President, we had an extremely useful debate on human rights yesterday. endTok	29.58182939989447
startTok I am pleased that we have had this further opportunity to consider a number of areas in the world - Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human rights has been a particularly severe challenge. endTok	47.54637457526492
startTok First of all, on Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards Kosovo, as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in Serb jails. endTok	69.82710264360577
startTok Our efforts in Kosovo, as elsewhere in the wider region, are directed at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation. endTok	66.71774265552145
startTok In particular we support the development of a free, democratic and multi-ethnic society. endTok	40.93077046972782
startTok Our assistance programmes in the fields of democratisation and human rights should continue to build confidence in general and, in particular, to try to build confidence between the various communities. endTok	40.710322939881024
startTok We have always condemned ethnic violence, no matter which ethnic group is the perpetrator or the victim. endTok	133.54777080643092
startTok We consider it is unacceptable against Serb and Roma minorities as it was against the Kosovar Albanians in the past. endTok	79.54980508779543
startTok We support the efforts of UNMIK, KFOR and the OSCE to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order. endTok	71.60612605473143
startTok In this regard we strongly support the High Representative' s recent appeal to Member States to provide more police officers for the UN civil police mission in Kosovo. endTok	48.998207425796345
startTok It was a point raised by several speakers in the debate. endTok	25.723502088822478
startTok I hope it will underline the importance, when we address the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy, of looking at the non-military aspects of that policy as well as the military aspects. endTok	38.277907566702325
startTok It is just as important to have headline goals for our policing and institution building as for a military capacity. endTok	55.72429678244815
startTok We continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in Serb prisons. endTok	31.90627339301293
startTok I totally agree with the points put so passionately by the Mrs Pack, either before trial or following judgement. endTok	128.85096242344227
startTok The plight of Kosovar Albanians who have been missing since the end of the war is particularly distressing. endTok	38.91904675698203
startTok We call on everyone, within and outside Kosovo, to support these common aims, to support UNMIK and KFOR in their efforts to achieve them. endTok	137.74137680738255
startTok Turning briefly to Angola, we had again a number of knowledgeable speeches, especially from Mr Soares, with his unrivalled knowledge of the subject. endTok	70.1380799572146
startTok The Commission believes strongly that press freedom and free speech will be crucial for progress with peace and reconciliation in Angola. endTok	130.83189935056686
startTok It is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society. endTok	33.29708311620153
startTok An area of special concern is the harassment of journalists, including temporary detention of members of the so-called independent press. endTok	72.80825918484298
startTok The European Union made a specific démarche on press freedom to the Angolan Ministry of Justice in November last year. endTok	60.66944170608377
startTok We fully support the work of the UN through UNUA, given its specific responsibility to monitor the human rights situation in Angola. endTok	69.43494706273374
startTok We are also committed to the Security Council' s sanctions against UNITA, including arms controls. endTok	59.349553350272096
startTok While maintaining emphasis on humanitarian needs, the Commission is preparing for a post-conflict phase in our financial support for Angola. endTok	92.90886551146102
startTok An essential element will be support for democracy and human rights, including specific initiatives to strengthen democratic institutions and civil society. endTok	67.3480316201962
startTok The European Union has condemned the use of anti-personnel landmines and we are supporting de-mining operations through an international NGO. endTok	50.715441515304455
startTok The resolution I would love to have a debate on in Parliament one day is on demining, and particularly the importance of destroying the stocks of existing mines: stocks in the Ukraine, stocks in Moldova and stocks elsewhere. endTok	47.718765900967334
startTok This is a subject which is not given sufficient attention. endTok	18.451235453428502
startTok On the question of the indigenous peoples in the US, I am sure that the resolution which was primarily addressed to the US authorities will have been noted by them. endTok	48.861402975810044
startTok Our general policy however, is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society, something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America. endTok	48.70802270621055
startTok The Commission shares the growing concern about the missing Russian journalist, Mr Babitsky and the conditions for the independent media in Chechnya more generally. endTok	68.49719615231265
startTok This issue comes on top of our deep worries about the plight of the civilian population in Chechnya, and I have heard Mr Posselt on this subject before. endTok	33.48057256876616
startTok There are alarming reports of human rights violations. endTok	35.253425579125256
startTok Of course, there has been disproportionate use of force in the present conflict. endTok	33.374614706554695
startTok The Commission delegation in Moscow participated in a European Union Troika démarche on the eleventh of this month. endTok	20.72652972307019
startTok We underlined our serious concerns about freedom of the press and freedom of speech and we pressed the Russians to clarify the circumstances of Mr Babitsky' s detention in view of their obligations in the field of human rights. endTok	46.45658138330992
startTok We await a proper response from the Russians. endTok	58.020685800487286
startTok In the meantime, the conclusions of the General Affairs Council earlier this week have confirmed the message which I have given today. endTok	33.90771399508838
startTok And we are ready to return to the issue at the EU-Russia Ministerial Troika in Lisbon on 2 March, if we need to do so. endTok	34.74925624613123
startTok Finally, on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge: we strongly agree that senior Khmer Rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes. endTok	44.20554826063493
startTok I totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by Mr Morillon. endTok	16.5773021611933
startTok We vigorously supported the Troika démarche to Foreign Minister Hor Namhong on 4 February this year. endTok	47.833173824663206
startTok The European Union underlined its full support for the efforts of the United Nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leaders. endTok	25.312092201827483
startTok At the same time, we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties. endTok	20.48843347249014
startTok I am encouraged by the optimism of Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal. endTok	33.92193713611382
startTok The Commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights with Cambodian authorities through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 November last year. endTok	63.491321352564235
startTok It has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days. endTok	30.46448575043911
startTok I hope we have other opportunities, but I hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead. endTok	59.42723123763471
startTok Thank you very much Commissioner Patten. endTok	4.905951086083287
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m. endTok	5.736184246078655
startTok Danube environmental disaster endTok	584.0143175978637
startTok The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: endTok	8.665793856228088
startTok B5-0164/2000 by Mr Leinen on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, endTok	5.788028792845659
startTok B5-0167/2000 by Mr Maaten and Mrs Thors on behalf of the Group of the European Democrat and Reform Party, endTok	5.61374434697538
startTok B5-0168/2000 by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Grossetête on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, endTok	5.854216692859071
startTok B5-0173/2000 by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Sjöstedt on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, endTok	5.19768031537621
startTok B5-0179/2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance endTok	6.41752565180793
startTok on the environmental disaster caused by cyanide leaking from a Romanian goldmine into the Lepos, Somes, Tisza and Danube Rivers. endTok	26.275850708600256
startTok Mr President, we debated the framework directive on water this week, and the disaster in Romania has demonstrated once again how very seriously we need to take the protection of water. endTok	50.70487464223076
startTok This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union. endTok	42.41318043310461
startTok We are delighted with the pledge that EU aid will be used to clean the rivers, and at least as important is the reinforcement of environmental awareness both in Romania and, more generally, in Central and Eastern Europe. endTok	33.62940679837979
startTok We therefore welcome Commissioner Wallström' s brief visit, for it can contribute to this awareness. endTok	55.42762234499598
startTok After all, this is a candidate country we are talking about, and this disaster is in addition to the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will comply with the EU environmental rules in time. endTok	42.84099208779418
startTok The polluter ought to pay. endTok	44.971419869819414
startTok I wonder whether the European Union can recoup this kind of cost from the environmental cowboys who appear in the so-called 'Wild East' , making use of the inadequate environmental legislation in place. endTok	56.933962963141305
startTok I would be in favour of its doing so. endTok	29.797512453539778
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, there has been one ecological disaster after another and, unfortunately, they are all similar. endTok	56.99170936364633
startTok Once again, there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important wetland in Europe. endTok	54.041204884610416
startTok The delta of the Danube is in danger. endTok	16.751014030072866
startTok As in Spain in April 1998, as in Brittany and the Vendée since last December, once again an exceptional natural site is under serious threat. endTok	88.4079349189922
startTok The European Parliament is constantly drawing attention in its resolutions to this sort of danger, which threatens our environment, upsets our ecosystem and again weakens our populations. endTok	79.85589924901142
startTok This new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate countries. endTok	24.65153646007535
startTok The authorities in these counties, which are still very frail from an environmental point of view, need to overcome numerous obstacles. endTok	65.21854830908983
startTok First, they need to be able to prevent this type of discharge more efficiently by equipping the most critical industrial sites; then they need to have suitable technical means of curbing and containing this type of pollution and, finally, they need to be able to implement programmes to restore the most affected and the most sensitive sites. endTok	45.56342843493313
startTok Today, the banks and the waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted, which is why the European Union needs to concentrate its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to come into line with Community environmental protection standards. endTok	50.07654631613903
startTok But, over and above that, it is the technologies and the means used to prevent and deal quickly and efficiently with this type of disaster which are being called into question. endTok	70.32219874545639
startTok I hope that our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility. endTok	63.65626161699757
startTok The environment must be a priority area within the reunification of the European continent. endTok	23.603625382728175
startTok It must form the basis for our partners' political will. endTok	107.38696526280383
startTok Implementing high environmental standards will not only allow important industrial and technological sectors to develop, it will also have social and economic benefits and, at the same time, public health standards will improve. endTok	80.037968260025
startTok The efforts already being made need to be stepped up. endTok	52.356282889044046
startTok The European continent needs to demonstrate solidarity and responsibilities must be clearly defined on the basis of the 'polluter pays' principle. endTok	31.226676190000518
startTok Mr President, when the Doñana disaster occurred, the non-governmental organisation, the World Wide Fund for Nature, gave us a report on the number of reservoirs of this type in Europe. endTok	34.38467626395111
startTok The number is huge. They are an ecological time bomb and affect the drinking water supply, ecological wealth and economic future of surrounding areas. endTok	106.5318665309982
startTok I visited Doñana after the spill and saw how agriculture, fishing and the lives of people in the surrounding area were enormously compromised. endTok	64.67168331138464
startTok I therefore believe that the European Union must, to start with, carry out an analysis of the situation of these reservoirs and compile a precise record of the number of these in Europe. endTok	35.979348044396076
startTok We must bring these reservoirs under Community law and the directives on waste and we must use the precautionary principle to ensure that this type of event does not happen again. endTok	33.37498869367625
startTok If we do not, we will be permanently endangering the ecological wealth of our continent. endTok	35.36062682950786
startTok Mr President, this disaster at the mine in Romania affects a large hydrogeological area with rivers and watercourses in Romania, Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria, The fact that 100 000 m3 of cyanide-poisoned water and large quantities of heavy metals have leaked out into the ecosystem is going to have appalling consequences for people in the area for a very long time to come, as well as for animal and plant life, agriculture, the tourist industry, biodiversity and the whole of the ecosystem. endTok	52.60056343804282
startTok It is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today. endTok	35.80352391237205
startTok Is a substance as poisonous as cyanide really to be used in the mining industry and in the production of metals? endTok	54.7781095416145
startTok The answer, of course, is an emphatic no. endTok	94.03139281445449
startTok There must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide. endTok	24.45187769391276
startTok I assume, therefore, that the EU will take the initiative and see to it that there is a total, worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance. endTok	51.874854868532324
startTok It has already been banned in most EU countries for a long time now. endTok	41.073739928957266
startTok That an accident like this can happen at all is therefore an extremely shameful state of affairs. endTok	74.62468792321151
startTok I have been informed that the Commissioner for the Environment, Margot Wallström, has travelled from Strasbourg to Romania in order to see for herself, on the spot, what has happened. endTok	39.47781274729401
startTok My Group assumes that Margot Wallström will promise to provide aid to those communities which have been affected: economic aid, support in terms of environmental expertise and help in connection with the massive cleaning-up operation which is required. endTok	59.414169264680204
startTok This highlights the need for something which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been demanding for an extremely long time, namely a rapid reaction force offering protection to civilians in the event of major environmental and industrial catastrophes of this type. endTok	27.4067634323909
startTok It also sheds light upon the low level of environmental requirements in some of the applicant States. endTok	38.41786613916717
startTok We must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people' s health and the ecosystems. endTok	37.27015644700118
startTok Mr President, I do not think we are in a position to throw stones at the Eastern European countries which have come knocking at the door of the European Union, because ecological disasters occur as much here, in the west, as they do in the east. endTok	35.16096517706491
startTok For example, the overflow from the decanting basins at the gold mines in Salsigne, in France, have caused tremendous pollution and are a huge economic disaster even today. endTok	39.317415996420294
startTok We know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions. endTok	101.7627320901228
startTok Who is going to pay? endTok	41.91565399628801
startTok Which is why the environmental aspect, which is becoming a matter of urgency, must be taken into account in all development projects at all costs. endTok	36.72096253811304
startTok I too should like to ask the European Union to put its own house in order here, i.e. to call on Member States which still have gold mines to commission expert reports, so that we know just what the situation is. endTok	42.44449902179819
startTok I am thinking in particular of the gold mines in French Guiana, where the workers, who are generally women, are exploited and work in absolutely deplorable health conditions. endTok	59.22925861916941
startTok . Let me associate myself, not least as a former Environment Minister, completely and without any reservation whatsoever, with the expressions of concern by honourable Members. endTok	62.22850171967702
startTok An objective assessment of the facts is not easy at this stage. endTok	34.943997210225795
startTok But early reports suggest that the poisoning of the Lepos, Tisza, Somes and Danube Rivers is a very serious environmental tragedy. endTok	38.36271957023075
startTok It has destroyed an entire ecosystem in a matter of days. endTok	47.702226551216334
startTok No living organisms, from microbes to otters, have been spared. endTok	39.75950493424576
startTok Several Members have set out what seems to have happened. endTok	54.8584881878968
startTok We have all seen some of the consequences on our television screens. endTok	41.50572087800396
startTok Some environmental experts have put the environmental consequences of this disaster, at least so far as damage to the ecosystem is concerned, on a par with Chernobyl. endTok	53.66262692439457
startTok It has affected the peoples of three countries - Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia. endTok	102.92826090037637
startTok It is the Tisza, Hungary' s second river, perhaps its most beautiful and most loved by its people, that has borne the brunt. endTok	83.43425147340591
startTok As with all such disasters it is the long-term consequences that are the most pernicious. endTok	50.16014251141417
startTok Some estimates suggest that it could take up to five years to restock the river. endTok	49.212972857606346
startTok There is a continuing threat to other wildlife from eating toxic fish. endTok	33.19180091581003
startTok We plainly have a responsibility to do everything we can, as rapidly as we can, to help cope with this catastrophe. endTok	39.22351643214985
startTok That is certainly the view of my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, who I know would have wished to respond to this resolution in person today. endTok	52.13826567626316
startTok The reason she cannot do so is because, as some honourable Members have pointed out, she is in Hungary and Romania to see for herself the extent of the damage and how best we can help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities to tackle the crisis. endTok	49.82974091306898
startTok We stand ready to do so. endTok	30.91090981348159
startTok We contacted the Romanian Government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently. endTok	67.28954524209557
startTok The Romanians have approached UNEF and OCHA, in Geneva, for an assessment of the damage in the Danube catchment area by an independent and international team of experts. endTok	46.035438711636445
startTok We stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from Hungary and Romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed. That is obviously crucial. endTok	86.42975380655123
startTok It is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it. endTok	39.099430160705204
startTok It is to that end that our efforts are now engaged. endTok	60.92557248761801
startTok There is also a need to clarify the legal responsibilities of the mining company and of the Romanian authorities. endTok	35.262159530283064
startTok This is an important point, as several speakers have suggested. endTok	23.369523351707688
startTok The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy. endTok	20.30661612916306
startTok It is mirrored in the International Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube River and it should be applied in this case. endTok	29.507142391721445
startTok The European Union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due. endTok	86.86096515909634
startTok The Union has mobilised some EUR 20 million over the past seven years to support protection of the Danube River basin. endTok	50.10040647838508
startTok In the context of pre-accession aid to the region it may be possible to redirect some of the assistance we are giving under ISPAR and PHARE to tackle the most severe impact of this accident, as long as the polluter-pays principle is fully respected. endTok	34.65035992743571
startTok We will want, in the longer term, to see what lessons can be drawn from this disaster, above all to see how to prevent such disasters happening in the first place. endTok	43.39506339016057
startTok The incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of European civil protection, along the lines suggested by President Prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two Members today. endTok	93.11976241994851
startTok But for now the priority is to cope with this crisis. endTok	48.37071494555306
startTok As I have said, my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, is on the spot today. endTok	27.564048864751083
startTok She will want to keep Parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit. endTok	82.52609511321023
startTok This has been an appalling tragedy for Europe and Europe has to respond and do all it can to ensure that incidents as dreadful as this do not continue to blight our future. endTok	50.88488407803468
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok We shall now proceed to the vote. endTok	14.539435159860203
startTok VOTE endTok	281.09893356486054
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok (FR) The only reason we voted for the PSE-Verts/ALE-GUE/NGL compromise motion for a resolution is because this resolution allowed us to condemn the decision by the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its factory in Italy. endTok	85.91219174614905
startTok However, the measures set out in this resolution are derisory in terms of combating the policy of the major industrial groups which are shedding jobs and exacerbating unemployment. endTok	42.557187945509654
startTok Moreover, it is all just words, because the Socialist governments, which are now in a majority in Europe, are just as incapable of taking action to prevent redundancies as right-wing governments. endTok	85.35018030698555
startTok The real problem is not finding a legal way of slightly complicating redundancy procedures, but banning them. endTok	65.6264956337091
startTok The only way of stopping the diabolical machine which produces capital gains on the one side and unemployment on the other is to ban redundancies in all large companies which are in profit, on pain of compulsory purchase, and to publish the accounts of large companies and subject them to the scrutiny of the workers and the general public. endTok	57.55793882924791
startTok Society must have the means of enforcing its own agenda on large companies and their owners. The first item on that agenda is the eradication of unemployment. endTok	87.02277222675916
startTok The sums needed to create useful jobs in public services and finance the distribution of work among everyone, without cutting wages, must be taken from the profits of large companies. endTok	98.74231334909844
startTok It is far more important for the majority of society than the waste involved in financial operations or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders. endTok	59.949555994899576
startTok . (SV) I cannot support the present resolution because, in paragraph 8, an individual factory in Italy is singled out with the express wish that precisely this establishment should remain in place, while the current management is being advised to try to sell the factory to a European tyre manufacturer. endTok	105.09029840190689
startTok It is not the European Parliament' s business to express an opinion on which factories in the European Union' s 15 Member States are to remain in place and which are to be shut down; to expand their work forces or reduce them; stay in the same location or else move; be sold or not be sold; and, in the case of those which are to be sold, to comment on whether they are to be sold to companies within or outside Europe. endTok	52.03447307296653
startTok Ultimately, it is a question of different spheres of authority, where the European Parliament and its Members do not have any legal means of changing the current corporate decision or do not even have a particularly deep knowledge of the situation in the factory as it stands. endTok	53.218698951872
startTok The Swedish Christian Democrats would emphasise the value of the European Union' s and the European Parliament' s concentrating on their basic tasks and not undermining the value of their actions in these areas by also acting in areas outside their jurisdiction. endTok	54.38319149193972
startTok Tourism and employment endTok	129.99270983183726
startTok The next item is the report (A5­0030/2000) by Mr Viceconte, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission: 'Enhancing tourism' s potential for employment - follow-up to the conclusions and recommendations of the High Level Group on Tourism and Employment' [COM(1999)0205 - C5-0112/1999 - 1999/2115(COS)]. endTok	9.15884219103865
startTok , rapporteur. endTok	2208.813055533366
startTok (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the European Union' s delay and indecision with regard to the introduction of a fully-fledged Community policy on tourism, increasing attention is being paid to tourism as a sector capable of generating new jobs. endTok	38.66387865354511
startTok One of the reasons for the Community' s interest is the structural flexibility of this sector of the employment market, which explains its attractiveness for women and young people, to whom it often offers their first experience of employment. endTok	64.32099345456221
startTok The importance of the tourist industry and its impact on employment - although everyone is now aware of this - is nevertheless based more on personal experience rather than on verifiable statistical data. endTok	82.17508059908995
startTok The fact that, due to the absence of sufficiently reliable and scientific statistical data, the tourist industry is in effect an unknown quantity has greatly limited the prospects of pursuing a consistent policy in this area and creating employment on a wider scale. endTok	67.13317885209663
startTok It would be appropriate, therefore, to begin by summarising the impact of tourism on the lives of Union citizens and the desirability, in both economic and social terms, of promoting the European tourist industry. endTok	37.51668998070617
startTok Firstly, I would remind you that the tourist industry is one of the infrastructures which any advanced society must have. Without it, institutions, business and the world of work could not function. endTok	78.6076897169098
startTok Tourism must therefore be thought of as the whole range of goods and services required by individuals moving from their habitual place of residence and thus confers mobility, the characteristic feature of contemporary society. endTok	83.96018297447412
startTok The term 'tourism' must no longer be solely perceived as synonymous with sun, sea and holidays, which has the effect of reducing the interest taken in the subject at institutional level. endTok	86.97971035684355
startTok Secondly, I would like to explode a myth, taking as a starting point an apparent paradox, which is clearly highlighted by Eurostat figures: the main international tourist countries are not those traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, but on the contrary the most advanced nations, whose quality of life is one of their main attractions and most heavily promoted features. endTok	68.91993318484768
startTok Clearly, the importance of tourism for the economy of regions traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, southern regions for example, is very different, and should be studied carefully. endTok	85.69428298389198
startTok It is an obvious truth, and one that is measurable by other economic and social indicators, that thanks to tourism, many Mediterranean regions have undergone a radical change for the better in their economic and social system and the way of life of their inhabitants, and achieved a drastic reduction in the numbers emigrating. endTok	74.09301153480395
startTok Social growth has occurred only in those areas where the tourist market has given rise to the development of all the activities required to meet the needs of visiting tourists, thus creating an entire productive system. endTok	56.63470995997449
startTok In such cases, there is a measurable increase in employment as a result of the growth in tourist numbers, thus establishing a virtuous circle of growth in the local economy. endTok	28.97040621723129
startTok This reminds us that tourism cannot be regarded as the poor countries' petroleum industry, because it requires huge investment in structures, infrastructures, entrepreneurship, professional expertise, social services and training; that the tourist industry is essential for the equilibrium of many regions as it provides a direct source of employment and a market for all local productive activities: agriculture, small firms in the industrial and craft sector, transport, services, retail sector, training, etc; that the development of the Community' s tourist industry is closely linked to its sustainability with regard to the Community objectives; that the varied geography and historical, cultural and environmental heritage must be protected and exploited. endTok	85.64297540339663
startTok In my opinion, the European Union can, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, supplement the action of the Member States and contribute to consolidating the potential of tourism by means of certain measures, such as the adoption of a specific legal basis for tourism policy in the Treaties; the adoption of mechanisms within the programmes and projects set up under its regional policies and other policies of the Union, with a view to promoting tourism in all its forms: rural, environmental, cultural, conference-based, spa-related and sports-related tourism, and also tourism focusing on senior citizens, research and training; the amendment of Directive 95/57/EC on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism; the cofinancing of projects to set up new transport services and infrastructures; the cofinancing of pilot schemes involving benchmarking and the exchange of experiences. endTok	63.166125313851246
startTok These and other specific measures included in my report can, in my view, lend added value to the actions that the competent national and regional authorities should foster, in order to promote tourism and create new jobs, starting with the adoption of positive fiscal measures to assist small and medium-sized firms, particularly by reducing the burden of charges on labour. endTok	74.40276200554128
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, before I explain to you the position of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, I would like to share with you three basic factors which, in my opinion, determine the present and future of European tourism in an international environment. endTok	35.121277192274626
startTok In Europe today, the tourism market contributes 5.5% of the gross national product and occupies a rather significant proportion of the workforce, approximately 6%. endTok	113.74609581553192
startTok Those figures are incomparably higher for some countries. endTok	69.80233469633934
startTok To grasp the importance of tourism for some parts of Europe, it is worth pointing out that in my own country, Greece, a country that attracts tourists, over the past four decades, during which the farming population has clearly aged and the population is over-concentrated in the major urban centres, the only areas which have retained populations of low average age or to which young people have returned are ones where tourism has developed. endTok	98.01375278297198
startTok It is therefore clear that besides being a matter of general economic interest for Europe, tourism is a priority for the economic and social participation of the European Union' s regions. endTok	42.55519929281594
startTok Another factor is that the world market is growing explosively. endTok	59.63263273475864
startTok The forecast is for ten billion tourists in 2010, but unfortunately for Europe there is a reverse trend. endTok	93.33167209689147
startTok Europe' s share of the increase is falling drastically each year to the benefit of Asia, the Far East and America. endTok	157.51553042786523
startTok You see, the world tourism market is influenced every day and directly by the liberalisation of transport, its reduced cost, and competition from new centres of tourism outside Europe. endTok	259.4782554241064
startTok Furthermore, 90% of businesses active in tourism are small or medium-sized, the very enterprises which form the living cells of our social and economic tissue, which are called upon to tackle the new obstacles and respond positively to the challenges of this global development. endTok	76.33933901353491
startTok As the rapporteur said, this becomes particularly important when tourism is appreciated as a unitary productive system because of its ability to absorb large quantities of agricultural and industrial products, services and transport and to create a significant amount of added value. endTok	64.0235646388555
startTok Here, then, I want to point out that international competition is tough and, if we are to overcome it positively, we must together envision and share a long-term strategy. endTok	66.44172861714301
startTok We must take very serious note of the need to upgrade the human resources engaged in tourism, so that tourism will be able to respond to the new technological challenges of our age. endTok	38.02830298992532
startTok Today, nobody can ignore the fact that new digital technologies and systems, with Internet at the sharp end, mobile telephones and digital television, are bringing about radical changes in tourism as a whole and its respective structures and operational models. endTok	111.48766060334218
startTok The introduction of these new technologies is not a threat, but a new opportunity for our tourism because it offers the potential to provide new and innovative tourism products and services, which our tourism needs for an ever-lengthening tourism season, so that it can attract new customers and offer new and alternative forms of tourism. endTok	108.20671304744846
startTok The new technologies also make it possible to open new markets in traditionally undervalued, non tourist areas, which could develop to become centres of tourism and attract substantial investments. endTok	92.08387374920325
startTok To this new labour market there must be a response in the programmes of tourism schools and training programmes for company staff, including programmes for training the unemployed and their re-introduction to work. endTok	106.67501077525988
startTok The Committee on Women' s Rights paid particular attention to the issue of education, because according to official figures women account for 53% of those engaged in tourism services, and in parallel, they form a majority among the working people most easily affected by social and economic change. endTok	121.41643932872843
startTok We must not forget that people working in tourism, especially women, encounter particular problems such as seasonal work, the need to renew contracts from one year to the next, social protection, lack of interest in continuing education, and reduced possibilities for development. endTok	89.37093052380149
startTok We therefore ask the European Commission for special measures and to adopt the principle of equal opportunities in all tourism programmes and programmes for company development. endTok	59.367017063779066
startTok Mr President, I would like to begin with some words of optimism, which came to us in the form of the High-Level Group communication of October 1998, the first page of which said that by the end of the next decade, it would be possible to create between 2 200 000 e 3 300 000 new jobs in tourism activities in the Union. endTok	44.06835911031872
startTok In addition, it said that this would only happen if the right conditions were created. endTok	51.903024288898365
startTok The Commission and Parliament are called upon to answer two questions: what are the right conditions and what is the role of the European Union on this? endTok	41.56573237444499
startTok The Commission and Parliament can help us understand, in the first place, exactly what we are dealing with, because even the term 'tourism' , as was, moreover, pointed out in the Viceconte report, is still an ambiguous term, a kind of variable that depends on latitude, climate, a range of opportunities, and a series of background factors; it can be synonymous with holidays or it can be a true area of production, income, wealth and employment. endTok	78.19097443012875
startTok There is a shortage of facts: we have no information on the economic impact, which still remains a complete mystery. endTok	54.636434056437984
startTok We have criteria for the gathering and interpretation of statistics which are totally at odds with each other, despite what was said in a 1995 directive by the Commission and Parliament. endTok	64.4034582817416
startTok With the aim of working out a strategy, it is vital to have a reading of these facts which harmonious and as strict as possible, so that we truly make tourism capable of creating jobs. endTok	128.86509461153798
startTok This does not follow automatically: often in the past a great deal of wealth has been accumulated thanks to the promotion of the tourist industry, without this being matched by an increase in employment. endTok	43.68392396069854
startTok There is no legal basis, and we feel that this is currently the major obstacle to any intervention in the tourism sector. endTok	25.114710750831506
startTok A legal basis translates into the ability to formulate strategies, to coordinate and to programme, all vital factors for making European Union tourism competitive with other markets. endTok	240.99495991351688
startTok A legal basis would mean we would avoid having to draw on the Structural Funds, as was the case in the past, to obtain some loose change. endTok	62.6896566520352
startTok Moreover, only minimal amounts were made available to us: we should bear in mind that the Commission communication indicated amounts totalling EUR 4 700 000 000 over the last five years, which corresponds to the cost of building 400 kilometres of motorway. endTok	76.97961668920173
startTok There is no opportunity to send a strong message to the Member States: recognising the legal basis of tourism would allow the States to acknowledge one of the European Union' s competences which at the moment, is only exercised in fits and starts. endTok	45.353840023718796
startTok We fully endorse the Community measures which were recommended in the Commission communication: advantageous taxation, that is, fiscal measures that offer conditions that are truly competitive in this market to the production sector - 95% of which, I would point out, is made up of small and medium-sized businesses, which is equivalent to 2 million small and medium-sized businesses in the European tourism sector; it awards special attention to vocational qualifications in the European Union, and therefore to investing in training; finally, it undertakes to make the job market transparent. endTok	67.27433812300178
startTok The tourism market is by definition a flexible market; we do not want this flexibility to be seen in a solely negative light, with seasonal work being misinterpreted as illegal work: remember that 50% of employment, especially in southern countries of the European Union, is done on the black economy. endTok	84.90237731406549
startTok We feel that the European Union and the Commission needs to make a strong commitment to sustainable tourism, which means having a strategy that is compatible with the environment, after the excesses of recent years when private wealth often did not correspond to high levels of employment. endTok	50.58127061230641
startTok First and foremost, we need to compete in terms of quality. endTok	35.343289274515314
startTok Finally, we consider that tourism can, in addition to being a growth factor, be a factor for democracy, and in this regard we are asking the Commission for a clear, conscious commitment. endTok	71.33386486277828
startTok Mr President, there are three points I wish to address. endTok	31.1496483901708
startTok The first is the inclusion of a legal base in the Treaty. endTok	19.65576474434637
startTok This is something I favour, but currently as part of a minority in my own Group. endTok	75.19667264123697
startTok We are all fully conscious of the importance of tourism, both to local economies and as a factor of European integration. endTok	40.96687389347063
startTok The problem for some of us, however, is the lack of specification of the extent of the legal base and of just how it would relate to considerations of subsidiarity. endTok	54.24702514232999
startTok Second, there are similar issues related to the establishment of a multiannual programme for tourism. endTok	38.17786063537268
startTok The resolution contains many excellent ideas for the promotion of different types of tourism and for its increasing professionalism. endTok	54.06134699717974
startTok At the same time the Commission is currently concerned about confining itself to core tasks. endTok	26.607604837544837
startTok The question has to be asked whether some of the activities suggested in the resolution might not put more pressure on its resources than is desirable. endTok	63.937470262767484
startTok Third, there are several references in the resolution to permanent employment. endTok	94.0692882730022
startTok Of course the promotion of this is desirable and permanent employment need not necessarily mean full-time employment. endTok	90.12880164336313
startTok But there will always be people who are looking for seasonal employment. endTok	40.144198789124005
startTok Students are an obvious example. endTok	57.668211624619794
startTok We have some concern that the resolution does not give enough consideration to them and to ways in which their interests could receive specific protection. endTok	58.25552200145568
startTok Thus, while complimenting Mr Viceconte on his report and finding a great deal in the resolution to commend, we shall be asking for a number of split votes to allow these concerns to be addressed. endTok	50.240811710145934
startTok Mr President, I too believe that tourism has a very important role to play, not just in our European regions, but throughout the world, because it is a great asset when it comes to economic and social development. endTok	19.503495206603954
startTok But it is also a very vulnerable sector, as we recently saw with the oil slick. endTok	39.43191710780891
startTok A flourishing tourist sector can be totally wiped out by an ecological disaster such as an oil slick. endTok	38.07049538644465
startTok When it comes to tourism, we can no longer do what we like where we like. endTok	76.48464604630081
startTok There are huge reserves; certain zones, rural zones, so-called zones lagging behind but which still have unspoilt nature and untouched natural habitats, are listed as having good potential for what we call eco-tourism or green tourism. endTok	179.92080893840236
startTok This could be developed and provide a large number of new jobs. endTok	35.30530619855277
startTok But these regions need to take real account of positive and negative experiences in other tourist sectors. endTok	56.10706463982138
startTok We must not kill the goose that lays the golden egg of tourism. endTok	20.460852802077884
startTok Tourism must be environmentally friendly if it is to continue to be an asset in the future. endTok	26.171938222586444
startTok I can think of many mountain regions which are continually spoilt in order to develop a tourist sector. endTok	38.0180953077963
startTok We have stopped counting the damage and destruction in natural habitats and mountain zones. endTok	58.17862663458861
startTok I should also like to refer to the darker side of tourism, the tourism exported from the Member States of the European Union. I am referring to sex tourism. endTok	18.780500573606037
startTok I know that action is being taken against this so-called tourism elsewhere, but we must remember the European Union' s responsibility at this level. endTok	43.291239624650956
startTok Under no circumstances can we, as responsible politicians, allow what is currently happening to continue, with young girls practically bought in the countries of the East and coming here to be abused on the cheap. endTok	78.42764016149674
startTok Finally, I should like to refer to the tourism which gives citizens contact with the outside world and democracy. endTok	35.66075924105287
startTok I am thinking in particular of countries such as Cuba which are isolated but I know, because I have travelled there extensively, that the Cubans who come into contact with tourists can learn something of the outside world, obtain different information and pass on different information. endTok	63.35683097655974
startTok For all these reasons, I think that reforming the Treaties would allow the huge tourist question, which is an important asset for the whole planet, to be properly integrated. endTok	38.709590989958706
startTok Mr President, during the most recent meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was pleasantly surprised. endTok	15.751811668186665
startTok The opinion of Mr Sánchez García, addressed to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, contained a remark regarding the IGC. endTok	35.582786026910476
startTok The draftsman of the opinion held the view that there was no need for a legal foundation for tourism in the Treaty. endTok	26.31064253519634
startTok This was in contrast to the majority opinion held in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. endTok	16.662245292120183
startTok Having heard many Members who share the view expressed in the opinion, this was a real relief. endTok	60.198686187824045
startTok Unfortunately, his text has not survived the vote. endTok	96.15673157296538
startTok It does, however, support my view that I am not, apparently, the only one who cannot agree with the majority opinion. endTok	53.77402605912051
startTok This brings me to the content of the report. endTok	14.137649004815085
startTok An important aspect of the tourism industry is employment and potential employment. endTok	49.39559922712148
startTok Especially in the southern Member States, the tourist industry is a major source of income. endTok	19.790515134312336
startTok From this vantage point, there is every reason for the government to formulate stimulating measures and a stimulating policy. endTok	48.702855240923604
startTok The seasonal nature of tourism and the employment fluctuations that this entails also deserve attention. endTok	83.63963298947492
startTok I am surprised, however, at the fact that many want to achieve this by means of Community policy. endTok	30.77174441998171
startTok This is not desirable, either from the point of view of tourism itself or the stimulation of employment. endTok	33.43020170155
startTok The discrepancies between the different regions can often be traced back to cultural or historical factors. endTok	66.20324455283098
startTok Within these regions, a huge range of problems have their part to play. endTok	114.28258120931741
startTok It is obvious that mainly local and regional - and, therefore, to a lesser extent national - authorities are best placed to assess the situation and draft appropriate policy. endTok	87.17664964961241
startTok For this reason, I cannot therefore endorse the transfer of powers to European level. endTok	28.115355053668438
startTok In addition, employment policy in general is also a factor. endTok	50.53840515173438
startTok Here too, the structure of the economy differs for each Member State, and the ways in which the current status has been achieved are diverse. endTok	35.62944243899314
startTok It will not do for one type of policy, probably with many exceptions and adaptations, to be applied. endTok	64.34025750051501
startTok This would mean that the EU would unjustly be removing tasks from Member States and that the Brussels bureaucracy would be intervening unnecessarily. endTok	44.64213570192772
startTok It is preferable for Member States to take measures to stimulate employment themselves. endTok	33.051293502497174
startTok Their expertise, is, of course, superior to that of the Commission. endTok	51.45224209079452
startTok This is why I am very hesitant when it comes to formulating Community measures to promote employment. endTok	16.963261531016485
startTok Even in the tourism industry. endTok	41.86144452228559
startTok It would really be a nuisance if Parliament were to attempt to achieve this unofficially by extending its powers. endTok	43.34134820873218
startTok Mr President, you will understand that we cannot assent to the present resolution as it stands. endTok	36.44862136206209
startTok First of all I should like to thank Mr Viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report. endTok	10.286148137530603
startTok It is a very extensive report. endTok	18.388312435824226
startTok We greatly welcome it, just as we welcomed the original report that it was based on, the report of the high-level working group which was set up by the European Commission. endTok	34.57461246516395
startTok I hope that the Commission will not forget that. endTok	14.191293747510722
startTok Having set it up, I hope the Commission actually makes use of it and therefore does not just allow it to sit around in the corridors and gather dust. endTok	62.35004160747674
startTok Tourism is basically small businesses and therefore a very fertile area for job creation. endTok	66.56295892845931
startTok As has already been said in this debate, three million potential new jobs within the next ten years is something well worth going for. endTok	63.01889011457897
startTok Europe can no longer refuse to give the recognition - both political and in terms of policy-making - that the fastest growing sector of its economy deserves because of its economic and social position. endTok	75.70420635194715
startTok We need a more dynamic vision based on tourism' s contribution to job creation. endTok	30.88120931905439
startTok We must recognise a sector that is predominantly engaged in cross-border activity and therefore deserves a European policy with a stimulating, innovative and proactive approach to sustainable business development. endTok	51.91869295443049
startTok I know the Commissioner is very keen on information technology. endTok	30.080432404111107
startTok He has convinced me of that. endTok	94.82372067950276
startTok But his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together. endTok	115.66003718762205
startTok There are several reasons why the tourism industry is an ideal test-bed, therefore, for integrating job creation strategies. endTok	57.7770977493396
startTok Let us look at some of these reasons. endTok	18.35650691258883
startTok The importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential is obviously one. endTok	82.72928056255219
startTok Various sectors of the population are employed by the tourism industry, particularly the more vulnerable groups, such as young people, women and the unskilled. endTok	45.70335405428696
startTok I am not saying that we do not need to raise the skills within the sector - of course we do - but let us get the jobs established first. endTok	50.503823463446224
startTok The availability of unskilled, temporary and seasonal work is very important in some of the economic areas of the Community. endTok	34.49478664350041
startTok Tourism contributes to regional development - in rural areas that are maybe trying to diversify - and tourism contributes to urban areas that aim to raise the profile of their own cultural heritage. endTok	53.48791333772437
startTok If we take all these aspects together we have the potential of really doing something in Europe and maybe extending the tourism season by staggering holidays right across Europe. endTok	99.24328243566143
startTok We must not lose sight of the fact that with enlargement we have the potential to increase the number of visitors who come to Europe' s shores to see some of the traditional cultural heritage that has not been opened up to the world for quite a number of years - in fact, about forty years. endTok	32.92002906721848
startTok We are losing market share. endTok	164.6440698824415
startTok I believe we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive. endTok	25.4365344403639
startTok I hope you will help us. endTok	37.51832689210858
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are addressing a very important sector that directly involves over 10 million jobs in the European Union and helps the more or less disadvantaged, island and remote areas to stand on their own feet. endTok	35.18304461762369
startTok And of course, tourism creates more jobs and contributes to the stimulation of employment, especially among society' s more sensitive sections: women and young people. endTok	92.52043885349184
startTok In view of all this, I think it is a serious contradiction that there is no European policy on tourism. endTok	22.610834271711813
startTok The lack of any legal base makes it impossible to adopt measures relating to the sector. endTok	36.539022681783706
startTok The occasional application of Article 308 - formerly Article 235 - which requires unanimity, has prevented the adoption of a programme even of only EUR 8 million for five years and 15 Member States. endTok	61.78926882704602
startTok The measures taken from time to time in the past have been fragmentary and therefore ineffective, and such provisions as have been made were dictated by parallel policies such as consumer protection, environmental policy, transport policy, taxation policy, etc., which very often are not only no help to tourism but on the contrary make it more difficult, since their introduction has usually entailed costs for the tourism industry without regard to its ability to bear them or its incentives to cope with them. endTok	84.4042641758821
startTok With sorrow, I stress that in the context of restructuring the Commission' s services, tourism is dealt with by a section, not even a directorate, within the Directorate-General for 'Enterprise' . endTok	60.54173708550933
startTok But we must support our tourism! endTok	62.90285479469774
startTok In our view, the axes which could create a basis for its support are: the addition of material capital for tourism in the new review which will also constitute a legal base for the sector, the framing of a Community tourism policy to support the sector without disturbing the operation of the tourism market, coordination of the tourism policy with other, parallel Community policies which affect it directly or indirectly, a study of the sector, and the adoption of medium and long-term measures to enhance the competitiveness of tourism as a product. endTok	75.01484902448587
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, since the issue of employment has been raised, I want to recall another issue which is also very serious, namely the bankruptcies among Tour Operators and their consequences mainly for hotels, which are small or medium enterprises lacking the necessary organisation and access to information that would indicate to them whether or not their contractual partners are trustworthy. endTok	72.80964790542295
startTok Clearly it is impossible to adopt measures at the national level. endTok	36.5444939647866
startTok In contrast, at European level it would be possible to look into measures for improving the relations between hotels and Tour Operators, for example a regulation of such relations, the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund, etc., in collaboration with representatives from the two branches. endTok	58.331462037120225
startTok In the past, the Commission had requested quantitative records of the losses incurred by companies because of such bankruptcies, so that it could form an opinion, and asked the European confederations of hotel-and-restaurant owners and tourist agencies, HOTREC and ECTAA, to work out and draw up a regulation to govern the relations between them. endTok	47.58231174059605
startTok Since then, however, there has been no progress. endTok	54.21259416683109
startTok There must therefore be measures to improve the quality and competitiveness of Europe' s tourism and, to the extent of the possible, safeguard the operation of companies. endTok	43.888065954319494
startTok Such measures must also aim to promote rational use of natural and cultural assets and of the tourism infrastructure, so contributing to the balanced and sustainable development of tourism. endTok	63.27235726741777
startTok I will end by congratulating Mr Viceconte and, as one who comes from Crete, a tourist area, I ask that we should always view tourism not only in terms of pleasant holidays but as a primary job creator in a Europe which needs those jobs. endTok	77.69291969760681
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, the new attitude adopted recently by the Commission on this important economic activity is striking to those of us who, in recent years, have kept an eye on tourism and its place in the Community framework. endTok	42.994723721869214
startTok We all know that this change of heart is basically due to the close cause-effect relationship between tourism and employment. It is also due to the recognition by the European Union, since the 1997 conference on these issues, of the enormous potential, represented by tourism, for employment. endTok	67.09912715471667
startTok In this respect the Commission communication before us today is opportune, as is the report by Mr Viceconte whom I congratulate. endTok	34.11723087117228
startTok This report contains 34 conclusions, including 15 calls to the Commission to adopt specific measures and actions without forgetting the environmental dimension and cultural protection, particularly in outermost and island regions. endTok	82.48517969022741
startTok It also contains four calls to the Member States which highlight the need to coordinate actions with the regional authorities and the establishment of measures favourable to tourist-oriented SMEs, particularly in the tax sector and in access to financial instruments. These would encourage the growth of employment in sectors which use labour intensively, such as the tourist sector. endTok	81.49827355925636
startTok Finally, once this legal basis to which many of us aspire has been established so that a common tourism policy can be developed, we must be realistic and prepare a strategy on tourism and its relationship with employment, as proposed by the Commission with the support of this House. In this strategy, young people and women, training and quality and the new information society must receive preferential attention. endTok	59.71267421437302
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking Mr Viceconte for his report, which has drawn our attention to a sector which is all too often underestimated. endTok	14.15213010834286
startTok Tourism is a social, economic and cultural phenomenon which affects most European citizens, either as the recipients or the providers of a wide variety of services. endTok	74.94731016713075
startTok Every year, nearly 200 million Europeans leave their homes for a short time in order to travel, usually to other countries in Europe. endTok	54.77492296525712
startTok Moreover, Europe is still the main destination for tourists from third countries, even though it faces increasingly stiff competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of products. endTok	60.7048616811568
startTok Since the Treaties contain no specific legal basis for a real Community tourism policy, the European Union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offers in terms of employment. endTok	48.707894964504845
startTok Vocational training and a mobile workforce are important tools in the strategy to fight unemployment in Europe especially, as far as tourist service providers are concerned, in meeting multicultural demands and ensuring that services are tailored to customers. endTok	71.1222342083687
startTok Employment in the tourism sector is often highly seasonal and precarious, thereby hampering its sustainable development. endTok	74.97290270199986
startTok It is therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skills in order to promote new means of production and a supply of tourism which reflects market developments as closely as possible. endTok	65.0177122548605
startTok As the report notes, the adoption by the Member States of tax incentives for SMEs in order to reduce labour costs would be an excellent way of promoting growth in employment in labour-intensive sectors and, consequently, in the tourism sector. endTok	55.20302758743534
startTok This sector of activity is also a deciding factor in the economic and social development of less favoured regions, especially the most remote and island regions, which have undisputed assets in this area. endTok	36.46630116656801
startTok Let us not forget that, in the most remote regions, tourism is the most important industry in terms of income. endTok	22.653840137105384
startTok The income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the Community. endTok	68.37286687224787
startTok In addition, tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement, insofar as it makes us more aware of other European cultures and thus helps respect for European ways of life to develop. endTok	85.07619347904114
startTok It goes without saying, therefore, that tourism, developed rationally in the long term, should represent a sustainable source of income for local economies, while safeguarding and enhancing the value of the rural, cultural, historical and environmental heritage. endTok	95.64397517733622
startTok I should like to close by stressing the essential role which the European Union should play in promoting new forms of tourism in new places which will allow continental Europeans to discover the most far-flung destinations in Europe, namely the most remote regions. endTok	45.247789413992066
startTok Mr President, we are having a major debate on a text of very little substance. The basic document is really no more than a Commission communication which embraces the conclusions and recommendations of a high level group on tourism and employment. endTok	42.40260450553879
startTok Not only is there very little substance but this is also a rather old document dating from 28 April 1999 which therefore makes it nearly a year old. endTok	101.90126599155495
startTok This document stems from the previous Commission. It is undoubtedly the result of work carried out by Commissioner Papoutsis throughout his term of office and which culminated in the Luxembourg summit and his failed Philoxenia programme. endTok	60.63277025830959
startTok I believe this is the first debate in this House with the new Commission and a new Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, who is of course listening very closely to what we are discussing. endTok	38.44739865949186
startTok I would take this opportunity to ask him a couple of questions directly. endTok	35.533937100579024
startTok Firstly, the governments made a commitment at the Maastricht Conference of 1992 to include a legal basis for this issue in the Treaties. This commitment was not fulfilled in the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997 and is therefore outstanding. endTok	61.38570617401522
startTok Yet there is a Council resolution from last June on tourism and employment. endTok	64.90777614906077
startTok What expectations does the Commissioner have that the new Intergovernmental Conference which is starting will include this aspect? endTok	125.33179306573065
startTok My second question is much more direct and perhaps more awkward. endTok	32.866167985570094
startTok Bearing in mind the failed efforts of the last decade, as highlighted by Mr Koch, does Commissioner Liikanen believe that he can do something during his term of office to ensure that the Community dimension of tourism becomes a proper policy, given the importance that all the previous speakers have given to tourism in terms of employment? endTok	67.74270907479233
startTok Will the Commission present new initiatives in order to see whether, through the constant efforts of the Commission and Parliament, we can gradually convince the Council to do something on this issue? endTok	52.03130964292135
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte, who spoke at such length on the tangible possibility, for the fifteen Member States of the Union, of creating jobs by way of a sensible policy, a sensible European Union initiative in this field. endTok	27.341694011611775
startTok This very afternoon we have had a debate on workers who suddenly find themselves unemployed. We now hope to be able to solve these problems. endTok	72.87414842615556
startTok Tourism is an activity that falls decidedly and fundamentally within the competence of the European Union. endTok	65.02164973744831
startTok All the European States are known throughout the world for being tourist magnets envied by all, including the United States of America, which we spoke about this afternoon with regard to the native Americans. endTok	40.4420124144928
startTok I would like to stress one point in the Viceconte report which I welcome and particularly support, and which I would like the House and the Commission to reflect on before giving a favourable response. endTok	41.37425686645681
startTok It regards tourism for senior citizens. endTok	224.21261935998626
startTok I usually see Commissioner Diamantopoulou desperately tearing her hair out, bit by bit, because the elderly live too long, leading to problems with pension payments. endTok	176.86815157636514
startTok However, in this case, the fact that we are living longer means that there are more senior citizens. endTok	34.04487282256777
startTok Unfortunately not all, but many of them travel the world to see its marvels and to discover and learn more about it: Italians want to see what the English are like, the Greeks want to see what the Turks are like and the French want to see their Italian cousins. endTok	91.74101342605843
startTok Tourism brings the peoples of the fifteen States and of the entire world closer together, and of course, it leads to peace and understanding. endTok	67.69572561470731
startTok This kind of tourism, which is undertaken mainly by large numbers of senior citizens, is just as important. endTok	71.83036165704854
startTok This type of tourism must be promoted and supported because it allows people to work in tourist destinations, not just during the summer when we go swimming in the sea, for example, but also during winter when we go to take the air. endTok	66.61633474019597
startTok Senior citizens are always on holiday, all year round, from 1 January through to 31 December because they do not work and do not have just one month off during the year. endTok	116.77529376843877
startTok Unfortunately, this is not true of them all, but this is why I am calling on the Commission to follow up on the Viceconte report. endTok	28.97050291655588
startTok . Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte and congratulate him on the report. endTok	8.535428818860911
startTok I think we all acknowledge the economic, social and environmental importance of tourism in today' s developed Europe and its great potential for growth and employment. endTok	58.70399945190664
startTok I am glad to see that the Commission and Parliament are converging towards the same goal in this area. endTok	18.973983336687414
startTok Employment issues are at present the core concern regarding tourism. endTok	270.64774927125376
startTok An essential condition in order to make good progress in the work in this respect is that the cooperation with Member States and the industry and with other partners be as fruitful as possible. endTok	47.95994083357189
startTok This will determine the success of our work. endTok	29.09495231520606
startTok Certainly the Commission will seek good coordination with national employment policies. endTok	108.33046171979338
startTok This will also be important with a view to the special summit in March, where tourism is bound to be mentioned as a significant contributor to employment. endTok	40.30039632733508
startTok Coordination of Community tourism activities with other important issues such as regional policies, transport, employment, environment, culture and competition must strongly involve Member States and the tourism industry itself. endTok	104.90665205249977
startTok As far as specific policies are concerned, I would like to pinpoint just one on which the draft resolution focuses - regional policy. endTok	33.442534155420525
startTok The Commission guideline document for the new structural fund' s programming period has already identified tourism as one of the areas with particular potential for employment creation through competitive enterprises. endTok	87.38990996800945
startTok The Commission expects Member States to put increased emphasis on tourism measures in their plans and programming. endTok	48.24676151832966
startTok Quality, sustainability, innovation are at the forefront of the Commission' s own policy and are priorities recognised by the Council of Ministers. endTok	31.72123050997364
startTok Quality products in order to improve competitiveness, sustainability in order to protect resources and innovation in particular through the use of information technologies. endTok	53.847051175755745
startTok Regarding sustainability indicators, the European Environment Agency is already working with the Commission on the issue. endTok	61.77015002635921
startTok I want to mention, as has already been mentioned by many speakers today, that tourism related to the natural and cultural heritage is expected to be the fastest expanding form of tourism in the EU during the next two decades. endTok	31.64636279354137
startTok These possibilities should be fully exploited. endTok	55.88517935685495
startTok Mr Provan said that I often talk a lot about tourism and information technology. endTok	46.500286114583275
startTok I am personally convinced that information and communication technologies will be a key competitiveness and innovation factor for European tourism. endTok	78.52463366553731
startTok The travel and tourism sector is the front-runner in making use of ICT tools. endTok	48.94202547653463
startTok This will dramatically change the way it operates. endTok	49.826723399087214
startTok Marketing, reservation and transport are expected to be the areas of profoundest change and improvement. endTok	64.15540149782473
startTok Use of ICT opens a completely new dimension in the context of travel and tourism. endTok	47.85259932045792
startTok Direct business to consumer contact will supplement, and sometimes also reduce, the currently, nearly exclusive business to business relationship. endTok	276.4951655847678
startTok It will give more and better choice to tourists and generate new and better tourist products. endTok	77.6598438843652
startTok For the Commission this requires that action in the tourism field must be tightly linked to measures promoting the take-up of information communication technology by the tourism industry, in particular by the innovation and innovative society technological programmes which are both within my competence. endTok	79.85117768435278
startTok The new strategy outlined by the Commission communication on tourism and employment, and agreed by the Council, places the emphases on tourism gathering and disseminating information and good practice. endTok	36.40076206355869
startTok The implementation of the directive on statistics aims at improving the knowledge of market structures and trends in European tourism and its industry. endTok	63.39397104347534
startTok Commission decisions have advanced the methodological approach. endTok	238.98592689197244
startTok The report on the experience acquired in the work carried out under this directive is part of our work programme for the current year. endTok	34.29770785462755
startTok More work on the social and economic impact of tourism is currently on-going with the international organisations, such as the World Tourism Organisation. endTok	56.37513532380299
startTok The European Community' s prime role is to ensure a framework which enables and encourages stakeholders and authorities at all levels to optimise and realise the tourism sector' s potential for growth and employment. endTok	53.5100435233889
startTok Such a European strategy will be achieved through building on the commitment by Member States and the Commission to cooperate in a number of priority areas: exchange and dissemination of information, notably through new technologies; training in order to upgrade skills, quality of tourist products and sustainable development in tourism. endTok	52.92385534508738
startTok In the autumn the Commission will report back on the progress made in this respect. endTok	26.124900675584108
startTok A report on the work to be undertaken, together with the Member States and the tourism industry should be available in about two years from now. endTok	41.76307225945515
startTok Depending on the results of this work, a wider debate could then take place which might well be the starting-point for even more comprehensive policy initiatives. endTok	92.18478800666726
startTok Mr Medina Ortega asked me some very concrete questions. endTok	47.159081171121684
startTok As regards the role of tourism policy in the communities concerned, we must understand that many policy sectors have a huge impact on the framework on tourism. endTok	52.66345625696256
startTok It is not only the targeted, specific tourism actions which are important but the other horizontal actions in the field of transport. endTok	67.55822422152768
startTok At the moment, the question of congestion of air and roads is the fundamental problem. endTok	26.57362406884693
startTok In the area of environment, we are looking at ways to cooperate with Mrs Wallström; in the area of regional policy Mr Barnier is giving a lot of attention to this sector. endTok	34.94398887892862
startTok We need to have this streamlined approach on tourism which covers all the policies. endTok	43.09507239058109
startTok I am sure that we will improve on that in the future when we have had a good high-level working group report, your support with your report here and also when the tourism sector is part of enterprise policy. endTok	51.102277676276266
startTok Why is it so important in that sector? endTok	56.870254592239554
startTok It is because the key emphasis on the enterprise policy will be how to help to create new enterprises; how to make it easier for young people and women to create their own enterprises. endTok	38.963286430325134
startTok That is where the potential is. endTok	87.75717384406965
startTok If we can eliminate the obstacles to make it cheaper to create new enterprises, to facilitate the access to financing and to change the attitude of society to be more positive entrepreneurship, I am sure the tourism sector will be the first to benefit from this. endTok	52.8744409851745
startTok There is one problem that I hesitate to mention today as I am new in the sector. endTok	51.72196565176137
startTok I have been working now in all industrial and service sectors, but when you look at the organisational structure in tourism it is almost impossible. endTok	88.0049576945684
startTok It is very difficult for a Commissioner to try to work in an area where there are dozens of different organisations whose representativeness needs to be ascertained every time. endTok	31.748680692827172
startTok To strengthen the role of tourism in Europe, the organisations should do what has happened in most economic sectors: seek better focus, better coordination and concentrated activities. endTok	108.03111636082943
startTok Then we could have a solid dialogue in our everyday work. endTok	52.78098530592202
startTok That is the real difficulty which we must overcome. endTok	27.13560156724002
startTok As far as the Treaty is concerned, the intergovernmental conference started this week so we do not know the results yet. endTok	38.281275269478314
startTok I want to be very candid: I have not seen much enthusiasm about that conference or the proposal to enlarge the powers of the EU. endTok	44.97178442004584
startTok Tourism is also in the list of subjects which do not figure as new areas of competence for the EU. endTok	65.27243337975678
startTok We will see what happens but at the moment that seems to be the case. endTok	26.776335702796167
startTok Finally, the Commission welcomes the resolution which continues the line of the high-level group, the Commission communication on enhancing tourism' s potential for employment and the corresponding Council conclusions. endTok	48.1291611423512
startTok The general agreement between both institutions in this field must not keep the Commission from following the most pragmatic approach in achieving our common objectives. endTok	59.641618889181835
startTok Thank you, Commissioner. endTok	17.829151062792345
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m. endTok	5.970398860411194
startTok (The sitting was closed at 7.40 p.m.) endTok	8.531845927588964
startTok Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting endTok	14.546692295191853
startTok The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed. endTok	14.154461824758924
startTok Are there any comments? endTok	12.892326383115599
startTok Mr President, yesterday' s Minutes will naturally indicate interventions referring to the so-called 'Strasbourg Declaration" which intends to implicate the European Parliament in certain considerations which would literally lead to the conclusion that I am a Nazi. endTok	43.41341106153954
startTok This declaration - which, as I have said, implicates the European Parliament, although no such declaration was put before this Parliament - is a completely unacceptable form of manipulation. endTok	59.25846878315658
startTok I thank the President, Mrs Fontaine, who just yesterday expressed her opinion by refuting the implication of this House. endTok	39.84069350112632
startTok Mr President, as well as discrediting the PNV, Eusko Alkartasuna and the democratic government of the Basque Country - who have the kind of attitude which, in the case of Ireland, deserved the Nobel prize - by calling them Nazis, the declaration insults representatives of the European citizens - as in my case: I represent a section of Galician society - by saying that we are more dangerous than the Nazis, and insults groups which are clearly democratic, with decades of history, in an unacceptable and crazy way, which I would like to condemn here and now. endTok	40.35310381167817
startTok I would like these words to be heard, because the European Parliament cannot be implicated in this way in a crazy declaration which I consider to be totally unacceptable. endTok	25.296834608192775
startTok Thank you, Mr Nogueira, for your explanation. endTok	21.43742743568978
startTok I would remind you that questions on the Minutes should refer to the Minutes. endTok	30.762736448460494
startTok In any event, for those Members who not aware of the President' s position, I will read the official communication and it will thereby appear in today' s Minutes: endTok	99.90854319168383
startTok "On 17 February, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, President of the European Parliament, received as guests, at their request, the representatives of the Forum d' Ermua. endTok	38.40575914456397
startTok The Spanish Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament were represented. endTok	27.207587427457742
startTok Following this interview, the representatives of this Forum presented her with a text entitled "Strasbourg Declaration" . The President wishes to specify that under no circumstances does she sanction the terms of this "declaration" . endTok	86.0856533354933
startTok Strasbourg, 17 February" . endTok	117.04471907044626
startTok I therefore believe that the issue is totally cleared up. endTok	16.359255850396853
startTok Mr President, I would like to request a correction to the Minutes regarding the vote on Amendment No 5 of the Swoboda report. endTok	17.668670300560752
startTok Please note that Mr Michel Raymond, Mr Jean Saint-Josse and I voted against this amendment. endTok	30.573768788265372
startTok We take note and this will appear in the Minutes. endTok	55.46574743867727
startTok Mr President, this is not exactly a point of order but concerns a communication we have before us today, namely that the Conference of Presidents open to Members, which was scheduled for 23 February, has now been cancelled. endTok	50.53586281449125
startTok We should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings. endTok	79.6249465140631
startTok I have the feeling they are just another compulsory exercise we have to perform. endTok	67.066947544331
startTok We can just as easily find out what happened from the newspapers. endTok	43.64045231853599
startTok That would be more productive and I do not like seeing the various committee agendas that are already overloaded being cut again and again because of this kind of show-piece. endTok	50.17673253975114
startTok So I think we should consider simply abolishing these meetings once and for all. endTok	75.5144577282531
startTok Mr Bösch, I take note of your observation but, clearly, we hold this type of Conference of Presidents, open to all MEPs at the original request of the MEPs, so that they may participate in some of them. endTok	46.78842723123699
startTok Surely we should be more selective. endTok	43.575720745217936
startTok In any event, the Bureau will consider your suggestion. endTok	49.350608689890066
startTok (The Minutes were approved) endTok	22.452217819019545
startTok VOTE endTok	281.09893356486054
startTok Mr President, we should like to request that the last sentence of Amendment No 2 which reads: 'also calls on the Member States to promote tourism for the elderly' be incorporated into Paragraph 25, which deals specifically with social tourism, after: 'tourism for organised social groups...'. endTok	64.72005515960332
startTok We think its inclusion there would be both more appropriate and more effective. endTok	71.03607774838159
startTok Mr President, the subsidiarity principle is one of the fundamental principles underlying cooperation in the European Union. endTok	23.824361659865215
startTok It is high time it was properly evaluated and that a system was set up which clearly identifies the EU's areas of competence. endTok	37.219070920313236
startTok A criticism which is often levelled at the EU and which, to some extent, is justified is that it is involved in far too many areas. endTok	49.45840962382507
startTok One such area is tourism which, by its very nature, is very much a national concern. endTok	184.90522335283228
startTok In so far as tourism falls within the political domain, it should be at national, regional and local level. endTok	55.605887681528486
startTok Tourism is a major source of employment and has a role to play as regards the EU's financial support for less well-off regions. endTok	52.90427578461212
startTok Even in that respect, any cooperation should, however, be carried out according to the subsidiarity principle. endTok	53.93085949885657
startTok Because tourism can also have a harmful impact on the environment, there needs to be a strategy for damage limitation. endTok	45.12513555782576
startTok However, such a strategy should come within the framework of environmental policy. endTok	41.06400709602948
startTok The report laments the lack of a legal basis for a policy on tourism. endTok	20.72562049049691
startTok However, the Swedish Christian Democrats would oppose any such development as we believe that tourism is a matter with which the European Union should only be marginally concerned. endTok	31.937576528608883
startTok . (DA) Tourism is a significant source of international understanding and an important part of the labour market, which ought to be promoted and encouraged. endTok	34.49689210244586
startTok It is of inestimable importance that people in Europe, as well as in the rest of the world, should have the opportunity to experience each other' s ways of ordering their lives and their societies. endTok	37.12778375820539
startTok Policy on tourism is not, however, something which ought to be planned and decided upon by the European Parliament or by the EU as a whole. endTok	36.05374590683986
startTok I am therefore voting against the proposal. endTok	20.91242091522263
startTok Mr President, before we begin our discussion, as an Italian MEP - and I believe I also speak on behalf of all Italian MEPs - I should like to condemn the position taken yesterday by the German Chancellor, who interfered in Italian internal affairs, when he threatened that Europe would intervene if any neo-fascists became members of the government. endTok	51.44375390907589
startTok Fortunately, the Italian Government and the President of the Republic intervened, and today the Italian Ambassador to Germany will also speak on the subject, to call on the German Chancellor not to interfere in Italian internal affairs, in so far as there are no neo-fascist candidates for government office. endTok	45.80610378596733
startTok We would like to thank the President of the Republic, as well as the Government and all the politicians who spoke and we too, in this House, would also call on the German Chancellor not to intervene in Italian internal affairs. endTok	32.38390725185997
startTok Mr Tajani will accept that it is a little difficult to understand the relationship between his intervention and the points of order, but I understand his political meaning. endTok	51.18322952675479
startTok We will proceed to the debate itself and Mr Monti will take the floor on behalf of the Commission. endTok	19.850600956070092
startTok European postal services endTok	126.81291361167456
startTok The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0010/2000) tabled by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to the Commission, on European postal services. endTok	8.046941657388402
startTok Mr President, the Commission's proposal on further gradual and controlled liberalisation of postal services has been delayed mainly because of the reorganisation and reallocation of duties within the Commission and the fact that the new Commission needs to re-examine the issues involved. endTok	36.08986669679886
startTok With regard to Parliament's various resolutions on the postal sector, my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, has already responded to some of the main points at the hearings which Parliament held last year. endTok	36.206594337116144
startTok Furthermore, as regards consultations with Parliament, Commissioner Bolkestein will meet the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism next Monday. endTok	35.63677413749288
startTok The studies were sent to the committee and to the MEPs who requested them, in September 1999 and are, in any case, still available. endTok	56.77704565335804
startTok They can also be consulted on the Commission's Internet website. endTok	20.246371216476412
startTok I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein will listen carefully to all Parliament's comments. endTok	34.57448881693539
startTok The Commission is firmly convinced of the need to prepare a new proposal on developing the postal sector. endTok	35.17440573814545
startTok Furthermore, the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation. endTok	41.16140004409396
startTok I can confirm that it is Commissioner Bolkestein' s firm intention to present a proposal to the Commission by the middle of the year, to be forwarded to Parliament and the Council. endTok	24.57656710438975
startTok The date set for completing the next phase, which the Commission intends to keep to, is 1 January 2003. endTok	64.75435073321522
startTok The proposal will take account of the studies and, in particular, the need to maintain a universal service, to develop efficient safeguards for consumers, to create a climate favourable to new jobs and to solve any problems relating to competition. endTok	31.143224996052478
startTok The role of liberalisation in modernising and improving postal services throughout the Union with the help of new technologies will be examined in order to identify potential benefits for the industry as a whole. endTok	50.04479816824581
startTok The proposal, when it is put forward, will take account of the points of view of Member States, Parliament, users, universal service providers and their competitors and by other interested parties, all of whom have been involved in an in-depth consultation process. endTok	50.30451695782942
startTok The aim is to ensure that the internal market in postal services functions smoothly in the interests of consumers and businesses throughout the European Union. endTok	22.89451319897903
startTok Mr President, the postal sector continues to be an area in which old, outdated monopolies are allowed to operate regardless of the requirements of competition. endTok	42.63405556730818
startTok And, in the absence of any energetic action by the Commission, the situation has gone on for far too long. endTok	42.91757419167073
startTok The EU' s competition authority has intervened in all other areas, but not in the postal sector. endTok	33.113470287897954
startTok We have now been waiting in vain for 18 months for the Commission to put forward proposals, so I should be grateful if the Commissioner could let me know today when we are likely to have a new, modern Europe-wide postal system. endTok	45.02151959839175
startTok One of the EU' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market. endTok	16.363855010048898
startTok We are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more Member States. endTok	48.262385018659195
startTok That requires greater efficiency which, in turn, is dependent on competition. endTok	78.89860804356756
startTok Today, one area after another is being compelled to introduce deregulation and liberalisation, an exercise in which the EU often leads the way, while the Commission's determination to make progress serves as a model. endTok	93.88345534963345
startTok The Commission is committed to liberalisation because experience has shown that the old monopolies are unable to provide the efficient service which a modern society expects. endTok	52.3678930969913
startTok It is also because liberalisation is necessary in order to be able to keep up with technological advances and, moreover, because it will lead to lower prices. All that, we are assured, will be more easily attained in a free and competitive market. endTok	44.16072575090834
startTok It has been done in a number of different areas but, unfortunately, the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now. endTok	48.25314606373099
startTok It can hardly be because customers are satisfied. endTok	76.79751004375368
startTok We are all familiar with the much-criticised price hikes, and delayed deliveries are a constant topic of discussion. endTok	41.0862275738394
startTok If we really want a functioning internal market, we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services. endTok	59.03377520481536
startTok A number of countries have been in the forefront of introducing more competitive postal services. endTok	35.116973443573805
startTok The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden have travelled furthest along this road. endTok	52.753810933864116
startTok During the 1990s, they were able to show the benefits that could be achieved. endTok	31.582000886180655
startTok Moreover, Sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus. endTok	117.86302484011303
startTok The process should be allowed to continue and be given the necessary encouragement. endTok	37.49623014315179
startTok Experience has shown that the old monopolies cannot provide the type of efficient service which, as customers, we are all entitled to expect. endTok	73.01554051405905
startTok Prior to this discussion, a letter was sent out by supporters of the old monopolies. endTok	52.33967103717227
startTok They hold up Sweden as a warning, which might be appropriate in certain instances, but not as regards postal services. endTok	70.27111417946682
startTok It is alleged in a circular that the price of postage has gone up by 59 per cent since liberalisation in 1993. endTok	37.65809383637304
startTok That is true as long as account is taken of the 20 per cent of the total postal services market where, in practice, there is still a monopoly, that is where the state is the only player. endTok	44.63416442127966
startTok However, for the 80 per cent of services where there is a competitive market, prices have fallen. endTok	53.00038851129261
startTok That shows that competition really is working. endTok	105.22377847332534
startTok My conclusion is therefore: make sure that there is competition in the remaining 20 per cent of the market, too. endTok	33.93223423898207
startTok It is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for ... endTok	71.38728783814567
startTok (The speaker is interrupted by Mr Markov) I thought I had the floor. endTok	25.959884892928784
startTok Perhaps we can discuss this later on. endTok	70.57168418448019
startTok However, I should like to affirm that it is exactly as I said, namely, that prices have fallen in areas where there is competition, whereas they have risen where there is still a monopoly. endTok	32.40611252114353
startTok That is usually the case. endTok	24.644895910386808
startTok That is why I should now like to see a Commission that takes the necessary initiatives and sees to it that there is effective competition in the postal sector. endTok	27.955803559105874
startTok Mr Markov, in five or six minutes time, you will be allowed a few minutes to speak. endTok	67.64087212684328
startTok I would be grateful if you would not interrupt other Members. endTok	25.456051557044944
startTok Mr President, there is a mystery. endTok	13.396558998759396
startTok What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was passed on 15 December 1997? endTok	43.60251249400572
startTok There has been a deafening silence from the Commission during the period between then and now. endTok	48.72408599169347
startTok I am sorry it is Commissioner Monti who is here today. endTok	28.119779528950623
startTok I am very fond of him. endTok	21.828858518991776
startTok He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners. endTok	37.899864556537274
startTok It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues. endTok	31.718507971759983
startTok There has, over this period, been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive. endTok	102.3574294024397
startTok Commissioner Monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties. endTok	36.21116112490604
startTok That has only happened recently. endTok	83.79144368562476
startTok For over a year the old Commission could have done some work on this. endTok	70.84069855271784
startTok We really have not progressed very far. endTok	30.5613138190106
startTok However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like him to take a message back to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about. endTok	43.21552592930137
startTok It was about gradual liberalisation; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price; it was about direct mail and cross-border mail remaining in the reserved sector. endTok	58.450964581546366
startTok These issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive. endTok	98.98296998079815
startTok The postal service is not just for Christmas. endTok	19.246110870952556
startTok It is for life. endTok	60.3231071119147
startTok In the area in Scotland I come from it is much more than just a postal service. endTok	29.26482156820168
startTok It is about keeping communities together. endTok	69.74228229715126
startTok The postal service is also the bus service. endTok	21.65504529356367
startTok The postal service is also the social service. endTok	26.467234035889376
startTok The postal service is also the doctor. endTok	13.95306604313344
startTok If we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we were voting earlier on tourism - will lose their tourist trade. endTok	91.486462060022
startTok We will cut them off. endTok	45.055129453381745
startTok The postal services are important. endTok	28.19188246079419
startTok That message must be taken back from here today. endTok	47.045612552124496
startTok The Commission must listen to it. endTok	18.074367456788018
startTok Mr President, we are in favour of liberalising the Union' s postal services. endTok	14.218529700146997
startTok This should first of all stand for better service. endTok	99.3988599293873
startTok This is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal. endTok	19.49932925552063
startTok Liberalisation began because there was doubt regarding the structure of the postal services and the value of a monopoly. endTok	67.19780933983772
startTok Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer' s requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly, because, for example, the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically? endTok	77.7354611482874
startTok The question is, therefore: what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet? endTok	55.1846309779805
startTok Most Member States have been putting the brakes on, and I am pleased to note that, in my country, the new government has at long last completed something which should have been done a long time ago, and that the Belgian postal services and the Belgian government are now taking measures to ensure that the postal services are ready - at least partly ready - by 2003 to be able to stand up to the competition. endTok	30.911816304202333
startTok As you can see, as a new MEP, I am trying to get to grips with the dossier and I must admit that I have great difficulty doing so. endTok	25.50438390288254
startTok I have found a number of studies which were commissioned by the European Commission at the time, and I am also coming across documents from Post-Europe which claims that these studies are inaccurate and that the basis on which these were carried out is incorrect. endTok	44.41907460336146
startTok I think that the Commission could have been more pro-active on this score and could have also provided us with the studies which it had promised to give us and which we had requested. endTok	36.208070494743794
startTok As far as I know, that has still not happened. endTok	23.843045382638937
startTok I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to help me in my task as a new Member. endTok	33.73904516677786
startTok Like Mr Miller, I would welcome an explanation from you regarding the implementation of the 1997 directive within the next couple of months or weeks or, if at all possible, within the next couple of days. endTok	37.34749056379846
startTok My second point concerns the universal provision of services. What is happening on this score, how much does it cost, how does it work, how do you intend to organise it and what proposals do you have? endTok	72.82364074312493
startTok I would welcome more concrete information on this. endTok	43.61627850599783
startTok Apparently, the postal service is a very strong lobby and rightly so. endTok	46.39415409273003
startTok There are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their living at the Post Office. endTok	14.422457288945951
startTok Moreover - and Mr Miller has already pointed this out - it will surely not be the end of the world if the postman no longer comes round, even in my country, however densely populated it may be. endTok	92.04203796647376
startTok But in Belgium too, there are a great number of people, older people for example, who only see one other person in the day and that is the postman. endTok	54.08241210120318
startTok We should not overlook this fact: postal service is about more than just ferrying around letters and parcels. endTok	66.099655820102
startTok The postal service is also extremely important to companies. endTok	18.498864477131082
startTok A study has shown that 90% of the postal traffic is between companies and only 10% between individuals. endTok	116.6083091929357
startTok What exactly do you intend to liberalise? endTok	26.599473396218144
startTok I would like more information on this, because the key question is how you can better serve the customer using the existing services. endTok	52.2983826684953
startTok There are postal companies which have a monopoly and are doing a reasonably good job. endTok	85.22707590994483
startTok We need to protect this type of arrangement and denounce other things. endTok	25.911208267974896
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, this morning on French national radio, I heard that liberalisation of the French postal service was now only a matter of days or hours away and that it was irreparable, like the developments with our neighbours in Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany. endTok	89.14369638000301
startTok This concerns us deeply and that is why we requested this debate today. endTok	42.23818867039249
startTok The Commission is committed to a universal postal service, as the European Parliament has shown on several occasions, the postal service is actually, as some speakers have already mentioned, a key factor in social and territorial cohesion. endTok	32.956357398796236
startTok In this connection I should like to ask one of our Swedish MEPs for an opinion of the study which has been carried out and which shows that in fact in the most remote areas of Sweden the postal service was rather poor in terms of distribution. endTok	29.732274322165896
startTok That is not the sort of postal service that we want. endTok	29.157492049138465
startTok The economic value of the postal service was recognised by the Treaty of Amsterdam and we consider that it goes far beyond the distribution of mail. endTok	25.32828894602947
startTok It is the service which remains closest to the citizens and which we call a 'public service' , which makes it possible for everyone resident within European territory to receive the service, and this entitlement must remain an acquired right, an acquis communautaire. endTok	57.14387902805824
startTok The matter of the European Union' s recognition of a high-quality postal service, available to all, remains valid today, and we are increasingly concerned. endTok	41.35209751488751
startTok That is why today we are asking not to have any nasty surprises in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism come Monday. endTok	22.319583087552818
startTok Let us point out that Parliament' s positions were clearly defined and that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supported them. endTok	24.711293608636364
startTok This resolution of 14 January 1999 required that, prior to undertaking any liberalisation of this key sector, involving 1.7 million employees after all, the Commission should provide impact studies for this liberalisation. endTok	143.91166263897807
startTok Well, we are not convinced that the studies currently available make it possible to implement this liberalisation right now and we are concerned because it is well known that liberalisation without impact studies would cause thousands of job losses, something we certainly do not want. endTok	65.03318452324784
startTok We value our public service, our universal postal service, because we know, and here too we are acting as representatives of the citizens, that the citizens value this service and the Commission undertook, during Mr Bolkestein' s hearing, to maintain this universal service throughout the European Union. endTok	76.45022543295501
startTok I shall not repeat all the various statements he made at his hearing, I think we all still remember them. endTok	63.78271903720254
startTok We further maintain that we are waiting for this proper evaluation before any definitive decision, as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive. endTok	52.344363257486826
startTok We shall not accept a date for the liberalisation of all activities in the postal sector until the Commission has offered us a guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the public postal service will be maintained in the States which consider this service essential to the citizen. endTok	41.2511551985856
startTok Mr President, I share the view that we need to make more progress from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the services offered. endTok	26.953731348167697
startTok But as an entrepreneur myself, I really cannot understand why it is always assumed this can only be done under the headings of "privatisation" and "liberalisation"! endTok	38.87127984238168
startTok Or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all, but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large conglomerations. endTok	96.8084569765398
startTok Members should however represent all the citizens, which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy. endTok	67.99737288832475
startTok In practice that means the following for the postal services: firstly, priority must be given to employment. endTok	94.78393940984984
startTok I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation, but the premises must be right. endTok	149.613557577276
startTok Secondly, we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services. endTok	36.0267477564317
startTok Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk. endTok	81.74884770488643
startTok Mr Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other Member States of the European Union. endTok	39.230689776761324
startTok So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent. endTok	73.37086933897609
startTok Thirdly, it is vital to have, first of all, a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens, wherever they may be; secondly, to have a uniform price for all Member States; and thirdly, to have daily mail deliveries and collections on working days. endTok	50.43325205857485
startTok On the question of the cost-effectiveness of the various postage weights, it is worth considering further price cuts; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying. endTok	69.14729617311826
startTok We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile. endTok	36.19546035042721
startTok In that respect I believe it was right and important to hold this debate today, to make Mr Bolkestein aware of Parliament' s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset. endTok	48.19666929918131
startTok Mr President, the 1997 directive, issued on 21 January 1998, which undertook the partial liberalisation of postal services in Europe, envisaged a revision at a later date, in a rather convoluted manner, indeed, since it was to be dealt with in a Commission proposal by the end of 1998, then decided by 1 January 2000, to come into force finally by 1 January 2003. endTok	46.73401022120511
startTok Well, for the time being, the revision has not got off the starting block. endTok	121.72396571712392
startTok The two initial phases were not observed which, logically, ought to compromise the third. endTok	134.8310100356579
startTok My first question is this: surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case? endTok	64.5574683330685
startTok Apparently, they were. endTok	249.27283307802853
startTok It is really not possible to see how the Commission could by the end of 1998, as stipulated by Article 7 of the directive, have evaluated the effects of a text which came into force in February of the same year. endTok	30.177262895352342
startTok Moreover, the Commission was also not able to provide the implementation report which, according to Article 23, it was to submit by 31 December 2000. endTok	62.31464225766976
startTok Should we complain about this delay? endTok	91.33804236969252
startTok We do not think so. endTok	27.032123524319505
startTok If the Commission actually did have convincing evidence in support of taking liberalisation forwards, no one doubts that it would present it without delay. endTok	145.36621122286772
startTok For its part, the European Parliament, which had fought hard to ensure that the 1997 directive was balanced and respected the requirements of a universal public service, is rather satisfied to see that the compromise it obtained then is proving to be tenable. endTok	57.70441080477812
startTok In these circumstances, it is quite reasonable for this House to express concern today, asking an oral question which urges the Commission to show the definite and unquestionable feasibility studies which to date no one has seen. endTok	67.38757561313088
startTok What are the scenarios for development and the potential risks? endTok	65.27489224747912
startTok The main risk is that the Commission, without adequate justification, might upset the balance which exists now by proposing to go swiftly on to a second phase of liberalisation which would, in some countries, throw off balance the funding of the universal postal service, making it unmanageable. endTok	70.39476639162831
startTok Today, following the 1997 compromise, Member States can give public monopolies responsibility for the postal service involving mail and parcels whose distribution cost is less than five times the basic tariff, with a weight of less than 350 grammes. endTok	95.78116692085959
startTok It may be supposed, for example, as Commissioner Bolkestein gave us to understand during his hearing on 6 September last year, that the Commission might propose reducing these limits to 50 grams and two and a half times the basic tariff. endTok	85.39369770621173
startTok This solution would not, in our opinion, be a fair one and indeed the Commission would have no irrefutable figures to support it. endTok	48.166434523526206
startTok But, unfortunately, we are aware since Seattle that the Commission has no need of a proper assessment of the previous stage before proposing that we go rapidly on to the next stage. endTok	84.01092306982365
startTok The second scenario, which we prefer: to defer the revision and maintain the current situation until such time as we do actually have a proper, detailed objective study of the effects of the 1997 directive. endTok	56.85843243834543
startTok In saying that, we are not seeking to protect monopolies whose pernicious effects we are already familiar with, but we wish to be certain that it is possible to combine the gradual evolution of the organisations with maintaining the key principles of public service. endTok	42.81814926397148
startTok Finally, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group wonders if the idea of foisting unified management rules on the postal services of the fifteen Member States might not be, essentially, flawed. endTok	31.257513788504173
startTok In France, for example, the unequal distribution of the population over a vast territorial area makes the obligation to provide a public service absolutely indispensable in mail distribution if one wishes to maintain the equality of citizens and social cohesion. endTok	73.72782189670792
startTok But other countries, in other situations, may have alternative analyses. endTok	104.88914532697096
startTok In our opinion, each one must be free to make its own organisational choices. endTok	41.57070751367834
startTok In fact, Article 86 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 90, stipulates that services of general economic interest are subject to the rules on competition only insofar as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance of the particular tasks assigned to them. endTok	66.62405411734558
startTok But who defines these tasks? endTok	194.10490527455397
startTok Who established the limit beyond which this public service mission is compromised? endTok	191.00503436171678
startTok Our answer is clear: it is not the Commission nor even the Council or the European Parliament, but the people of each Member State by democratic procedures. endTok	49.626610275000594
startTok To wish to proceed in any other way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions. endTok	65.62098827011468
startTok Mr President, we are currently in the first phase of transposition of Directive 97/67/CE on postal services and I am terribly afraid that a new phase of liberalisation might be reflected in a significant reduction in the public service offered. endTok	32.883803501772405
startTok During Mr Bolkestein' s hearing, my colleague Véronique Mathieu asked for an undertaking "that any new proposals, once these are known, should be the subject of impact studies to determine the implications of this liberalisation programme before these provisions are adopted." endTok	84.57738321656439
startTok What has become of it? endTok	142.50903799313636
startTok Do we have the results of this impact study? endTok	52.52920370801425
startTok As you know, we members of the EDD Group, are in favour, along with others, of rural life, maintaining employment, and social cohesion in rural areas, a cohesion reinforced by high quality universal public service. endTok	71.74625528148144
startTok Most assuredly I would like to be able to say that the examples I observe every day in my own country and in my own region, a very rural one, convince me that we can safely proceed to a new phase of liberalisation. endTok	39.94223144960416
startTok Unfortunately, this is not the case and currently, by merging the start of the application of the European directive and the application of the 35-hour law, which is purely French, but also by changing the working time criteria, such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per workstation as opposed to 1 400, as previously, in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed. endTok	74.71772640543789
startTok This is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service. endTok	29.39661119311199
startTok I have here the local paper for my municipality, which reads, "The manager of the post office wishes to inform the local population that as of 3 January 2000" - you can see how topical this is - "the last collection will take place at 3.45 p.m. instead of at 4.30 p.m. as at present." endTok	62.6248229164736
startTok So you can appreciate why I am afraid of a phase of extensive liberalisation, and a package of measures which will entail a new wave of depopulation. endTok	46.79673861595932
startTok As you know, in our country, each village has its own local post office or at least a post box, with a collection every day. endTok	70.89939781088046
startTok The postman is not just a simple mail distribution operative but also the only social link with the local residents. endTok	45.58658372741308
startTok So he delivers money too, and sometimes even medicines, thus making it possible for isolated elderly people to be supported in living at home. endTok	135.51811221949097
startTok If postal services are liberalised in a poorly regulated way, more post offices will be closed, in the name of this infamous profitability, which is often the cause of rural regression. endTok	51.87798404899208
startTok Once again, Europe is distancing itself from its poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants. endTok	56.55990007177277
startTok They will be told that they are too expensive, without drawing any comparison with other social services such as police and health services but also sports and cultural services, where lack of profitability is scarcely admitted in urban areas. endTok	101.63907044505372
startTok Everyone is free to choose their lifestyle. endTok	57.006223069755976
startTok They should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment. endTok	23.795075675082252
startTok In sport the saying goes, "Do not change a winning team." endTok	125.81128891457155
startTok Why should we wish to change a system which is satisfactory? endTok	43.96375252055753
startTok The universal service will be able to fulfil its social mission only if it retains an area of monopoly enabling it to balance its budget. endTok	63.74012329415155
startTok We cannot afford to make a mistake, for we know for a fact that we shall not be able to turn the clock back and that in the event of an imbalance, the firm will know how to tackle it: jobs will be lost, services will be reduced, the dead wood will be removed and we already know which areas will be considered dead wood. endTok	59.40371608828142
startTok We are told we should change the limit from 350 grammes to 150 grammes, or even 50 grammes. endTok	99.8489631915038
startTok So be it. But the 200 grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies. endTok	161.41399370176657
startTok So, once again, why not leave things as they are and allow the public service to fund itself and to guarantee the annual excess cost of its operations in the public interest, valued in France, by Senator Larcher, as it happens, at FF 8 billion? endTok	83.12926490682038
startTok If revenue is lost, then public interest operations will be revised and cut, and again it is in rural areas that the most swingeing cuts will be made. endTok	80.16477666544118
startTok What we should do now, I feel, is wait, particularly until we know the economic and social impact of one phase of liberalisation before taking the risk of destabilising an entire section of our universal public service, which many of our fellow citizens still value highly. endTok	105.716589893044
startTok Mr President, I am one of those who agree that it is appropriate that this particular service should be regulated at European level. endTok	20.904958340254183
startTok If people are to be free to provide services across borders it is only fair and reasonable that we should have European regulations to govern it. endTok	63.09029869426471
startTok In Ireland some services are provided by companies from outside Ireland, for example, English companies certainly operate there. endTok	195.5358935577751
startTok But this directive has never been transposed into national law. endTok	45.52136395169345
startTok It is the job of the Commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under European law and transpose European directives. endTok	43.83552764503757
startTok That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government. endTok	34.0617845872454
startTok A small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators. endTok	46.537141258486685
startTok But the need for common legislation is underlined by the fact that in the Netherlands they have liberalised, in Germany they have not, yet German companies which enjoy the protection of national law seek to take market share in the Netherlands. endTok	60.005611090184274
startTok This is another example of the importance of moving forward with common legislation and ensuring that it is put into effect throughout the Union. endTok	36.96032067544054
startTok I come from a rural area. endTok	39.518739559657774
startTok I support the principle of liberalising and the right of everybody to compete and I recognise the benefits that common regulation and liberalisation has brought over the years. endTok	54.90148355121416
startTok For example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago. endTok	24.149684977457543
startTok I remember when people came into this House lobbying us in the national interest not to allow this liberalisation. endTok	87.57082304169823
startTok We allowed it and the result is that our young people can travel and broaden their education. endTok	70.28173697975328
startTok Our older people, even though on social welfare, can enjoy the benefits of travel. endTok	141.28794088829662
startTok So liberalisation has taken a lot of parasites off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living. endTok	94.07180022753754
startTok On the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation cannot and will not be provided. endTok	63.45560687613197
startTok So, the Commission, in bringing forward their new proposals, must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services. endTok	90.55458654189208
startTok In rural areas, for many years, even before the Irish Free State came into existence, we sometimes had this service of a post office. endTok	112.68867470118464
startTok Today, it is probably the only public service in many remote areas and people are concerned that European legislation will eventually make it difficult to maintain it. endTok	48.199300805761254
startTok I want to underline the fact that the existing legislation protects rather than threatens the right of every citizen in every remote area to have this service. endTok	47.23886571750563
startTok But complaints are made by private individuals about social welfare being paid in the post offices in Ireland. endTok	96.32749497473151
startTok I want the Commission to recognise that this is a necessary social service. endTok	21.788010975921765
startTok It should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas. endTok	33.34928087319288
startTok We must implement what the directive insists on, that the postal service is available to everybody. endTok	53.585367441314474
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, besides the fact that the postal services doubtless play an extremely important part in providing employment, they are very helpful in the effort to achieve the cohesion we all want so much and which is a basic reason for the European Union' s existence. endTok	35.64882416741841
startTok As is known, the Commission should already, before the end of 1998, have tabled new proposals for a revision of the Postal Services Directive 97/67, guaranteeing the continued provision of a universal service, securing its economic viability, and regulating the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market while taking into account the consequences of this for all those involved, including postal workers and customers. endTok	64.17966528670306
startTok To that end, the Commission has commissioned studies on the cost of universal services, the consequences of liberalising cross-border mail and direct mail, the consequences of reducing weight and cost limits in the reserved sector, the consequences of liberalising the other phases of the postal process, excluding distribution, and an overall appraisal of the results of those studies. endTok	65.90521938220506
startTok Mr President, we are therefore wondering, and we ask the Commission - although, of course, Mr Bolkestein is not here, but Mr Monti is a man of many parts and I think he may have a view on this: should those studies not examine the economic and social impact of the various liberalisation scenarios envisaged on each, and I repeat, on each one of the European Union' s Member States? endTok	55.9646472321331
startTok The postal services in Greece, Great Britain, the Netherlands or Belgium are, of course, all different. endTok	109.52905761181573
startTok With liberalisation, how will it be possible for the universal postal service to be funded and to operate correctly in a country such as my own, Greece, with its particular geographical features and its numerous, small but inhabited islands? endTok	96.0222527114401
startTok How can a universal service provider in my country survive with the liberalisation of cross-border mail which amounts to approximately 25%, as opposed to less than 5% in other countries? endTok	43.15153781554508
startTok How are we to deal with the transfer of the national post office' s business abroad? endTok	52.56233997136333
startTok We have just heard Mr McCartin on the subject. endTok	21.2155867881959
startTok It will most certainly be necessary, we say, because of the technological developments that simplify this transfer and thereby make it more profitable, to determine the further gradual and controlled liberalisation by setting weight and price limits. endTok	99.13019789527218
startTok But what will those limits be? endTok	127.45982392814528
startTok Are we naively to grant 'freelance' enterprises the right to operate selectively and therefore circumvent the weight limit very easily since the content of letters cannot, of course, be checked? endTok	82.74596891663725
startTok In any event, we ask the Commission to lay its cards on the table and put forward its proposals, having examined the ultimate foreseeable development of the matter from every aspect and for all the Member States. endTok	47.01003590361295
startTok It is self-evident that liberalisation is not an end in itself, but only a means towards improving services. endTok	67.09509586082504
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the planned liberalisation of the traditional national postal services raises the inevitable question as to what the postal services will consider their core business to be in the future. In other words, what will the postal services be prepared to do themselves, what will they want to do together in international cooperation and what will they no longer provide? endTok	48.14823618224575
startTok This question should be answered in light of the fact that the age-old monopoly has de facto been undermined by all kinds of courier companies and by technological developments, such as fax and e-mail. endTok	46.38797127813128
startTok But then again, the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment. endTok	42.456472146329226
startTok Past experiences have sufficiently shown that early retirement schemes and voluntary redundancy schemes often have an undesired effect. endTok	123.49771670692566
startTok I would remind you of the fact that the Belgian telephone company had to recall employees who had been sent into retirement in order to prevent too much know-how and expertise from disappearing from the company. endTok	50.8374946866776
startTok Once again, the point of discussion in the liberalisation of the postal services will no doubt be a reduction in the workforce. endTok	37.61338108838988
startTok One should, however, be very aware of the fact that if people are encouraged to apply for voluntary redundancy, the company will primarily lose those people who already work under pressure or who can easily find employment elsewhere, in other words, they are often the people which the company in question needs. endTok	94.40531818731924
startTok In my opinion, it would be a sign of well-thought-out human resource management if the Commission were to share a number of these concerns, so as to ensure that a sensitive sector such as the postal service is liberalised with minimum impact on social conditions. endTok	61.71044557280496
startTok Mr President, postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in Parliament at the moment and rightly so, given their importance. endTok	53.821907136899696
startTok Only last week, in the UK parliament at Westminster the newly-elected MP from our European Free Alliance partners, Plaid Cymru, the party of Wales, made his maiden speech on that subject. endTok	72.43548090532752
startTok The Scottish parliament too recently had a debate with particular reference to the role which post offices, especially in rural areas, play in service provision and the sustainability of rural communities. endTok	73.22624018420021
startTok Liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services. endTok	127.87859935283043
startTok Post office outlets in Scotland, as we have heard, handle much more than just mail delivery. endTok	90.22314199834447
startTok Traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house rents, local taxes and so on. But as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts, so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened. endTok	112.85591187228464
startTok If a rural post office closes, usually with the only local shop attached, then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result. endTok	174.92431080290024
startTok Instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems, governments, and the Commission too, should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon, providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents. endTok	71.26416892610088
startTok Mr President, the task of the post office is to ensure that, every day, the post is delivered everywhere, be it in the city or in remote, rural areas, at the same tariff. endTok	44.41207494504747
startTok For 150 years, the postal services have been a public affair and, as such, just like public transport and the power supply, a core task of the national governments. endTok	98.41937548122674
startTok Such recognisable and useful core tasks give the electorate a reason to vote. endTok	134.51968029770467
startTok They are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs. endTok	97.92597404254799
startTok I once heard a Christian Democratic politician make the following comment in a Dutch village: "The postal service belongs to us all; taking it away from us is tantamount to theft" . endTok	91.80367840897223
startTok The existing postal companies no longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors. endTok	85.07270474640627
startTok The newcomers are only interested in those parts of the work that generate high profits at low cost and low prices. endTok	87.8879977935803
startTok They can be the cheapest for a while only by means of a drop in quality for their customers and employees. endTok	77.58400421717478
startTok Such companies have always been around, but they used to be banned, whereas these days they are being heralded as progress. endTok	85.96267684022153
startTok The end result will be that existing companies will also be forced into bad practices. endTok	107.83986261575217
startTok They will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages. endTok	88.44457623778936
startTok They will often do fewer home deliveries, charge more for retaining post during the holidays, close down a large number of the post office branches and, ultimately, the tariffs for the individual will sharply increase, at which point the only parties which will stand to benefit from this type of practice will be companies which conclude collective agreements at a lower tariff. endTok	132.58945848526724
startTok It is time we stopped this trend. endTok	49.207669697607464
startTok A fault confessed is half redressed. endTok	89.69479620492021
startTok We are better off with one democratically controlled monopoly than the waste and chaos brought on by competition which cannot be controlled. endTok	97.841912910419
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, people used to be summoned to demonstrations by letter or telegram; nowadays this is done by e-mail and via websites! endTok	55.99569168451973
startTok Incidentally, many thanks to Mr Scharping, the Chairman of the European Social Democrats, for withdrawing the call to take part in demonstrations in Austria from his homepage and therefore not advising anarchists in favour of violent action to go to Vienna tomorrow. endTok	57.330698530828
startTok It is clear that electronic mail, electronic commerce is going to become extremely important in the future. endTok	27.286568288320613
startTok I also see this as offering special potential for the existing postal service. endTok	66.48181829155409
startTok We know that until the year 2002 it will not be possible to fill some 1.2 million jobs in the field of electronic commerce because we do not have the skilled workers needed for this market. endTok	36.534179363288246
startTok I believe that this opens up very extensive employment potential in the postal administration in particular, which can prepare its existing staff for this very interesting challenge by means of training and further training measures. endTok	76.09304466643394
startTok Of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage, because they are so densely distributed throughout Europe. endTok	71.58007856915984
startTok Even the tiniest village has a post office and in future e-commerce will make far more use of the post because many people will order goods by e-mail and through websites and also send bills and so forth by that means. That is why the physical handling of these transactions will also become increasingly important. endTok	106.1977827240898
startTok The collection, sorting, transportation and delivery of mail will take on an entirely new dimension. endTok	104.56180856621563
startTok I believe that in future we must seize this opportunity. endTok	17.180676379496248
startTok As politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests. endTok	68.95382387104058
startTok We want our consumers to obtain as much as possible for the wages they are paid. endTok	42.23703059384215
startTok That faces us with the very important challenge of offering the consumers cheaper postal services. endTok	80.76566777342005
startTok We should take a look - thinking also of benchmarking - at what the consumer currently pays for an employee in the existing postal services and what he pays for an employee in the private sector. endTok	91.00147379219194
startTok This transparency is also very important for the unions, for how can a union official who has to represent his members in a private company compete with a union official who has to represent his members in the postal service? endTok	82.57923675251958
startTok I think it is important for the unions too to operate under uniform economic and social framework conditions so as to achieve the best results for their members on a basis of justice, fairness and solidarity. endTok	60.316836820645015
startTok But I also believe that in future we will have to make the universal service sufficiently attractive. endTok	25.556993743613358
startTok We should define the universal service precisely, establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender. endTok	137.20496288909112
startTok In rural areas where we have real fears that these services really can no longer be cost-effective, I believe the decision should be taken by a regulator who can lay down fair and decent tendering conditions, so that all the market forces, and of course the existing postal services too, can compete here and so that we can pursue the best and most efficient consumer strategies. endTok	73.01379970866898
startTok I believe we must avoid further subsidies and should try to ensure that the private supplier and the consumer benefit from the new system. endTok	45.6326358688613
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, postal services, just like any European public service, contribute to the social cohesion of Community territory under the terms of Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. endTok	30.8850896815091
startTok By equalising tariffs, i.e. treating citizens and economic operators on a basis of strict equality with regard to the cost of the service, by meeting the obligation to provide a universal service, while complying with the requirement for quality of service, postal services reflect the concern which we must have to ensure equality between different regions and the people resident in them. endTok	51.742686683617855
startTok They also play a major role in maintaining links between people. endTok	43.84177791071139
startTok As has been pointed out here on many occasions, is the postman not in fact the last point of contact in depopulated districts or divided communities, whether these are areas that are isolated geographically or the problem districts in our towns and cities? endTok	60.95131762269445
startTok Let me cite the example of the initiative of the French postal service, which decided, for instance, to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas. endTok	58.887354504763955
startTok Without even mentioning the jobs in related sectors, European public postal services today employ one and a half million operatives whose futures are clearly threatened by the spectre of radical, untrammelled liberalisation. endTok	113.22195435465206
startTok The European Parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs. endTok	51.76182400583508
startTok We may congratulate ourselves on this, but we intend that this should continue and this is the reason why one can only deplore the fact that the European Parliament is today being excluded from the main decision-making process which will determine the fate of the postal sector in Europe. endTok	31.370097826978313
startTok Indeed it is regrettable that to date - as the resolution we are debating points out - the Commission has not taken account of the resolution of 14 January 1999. endTok	37.89104641546132
startTok That resolution called for the European Parliament to be involved in drawing up the planned measures and urged that the reliability of impact studies regarding liberalisation should be improved. endTok	61.05790066056553
startTok These impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation, not just on the economic organisation of the market, but also in terms of its human and social aspects. endTok	42.32693122185605
startTok The delays in the Commission' s work will inevitably have a knock-on effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of 2003 must certainly be called into question. endTok	47.02484409055475
startTok By defining a sector reserved for public postal services, on the basis of weight and price limits, the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases. endTok	91.55755339870171
startTok The sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services. endTok	34.35724049331036
startTok Against a background of globalisation, where the rationale of profitability and profit is coming increasingly into conflict with the wish to achieve both a balance between regions and social cohesion, we must here, as a matter of urgency, reiterate our commitment to European public service, whether it be, today, the postal service or, tomorrow, the rail service or, the day after that, the health service. endTok	91.37005970883939
startTok Mr President, I rise as other Scottish Members of this House, representatives of Scotland, to protest against anything that lead to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote parts. endTok	49.98330466880636
startTok The postal service and the post office are a vital feature of life in rural communities throughout Europe and not least in Scotland. endTok	31.100374414667602
startTok It would be a disaster if action were deliberately, or even inadvertently, taken which had the effect of damaging that. endTok	81.95066659058186
startTok I do not believe that it is anybody' s intention to do so. endTok	9.76912613507013
startTok I do not believe that the Commission has set out to make war upon the islands of Scotland or Greece. endTok	29.100897740635922
startTok But they might accidentally do great damage. endTok	197.65024383992872
startTok The point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place. endTok	62.769221836637676
startTok If too low a limit were set for the continuing monopoly right of the postal service, it would become uneconomical to maintain in the outlying areas universality of service at what would remain an affordable rate. endTok	79.81691662872203
startTok The critical thing is to balance universality and affordability. endTok	36.921444847303185
startTok The message that is coming very clearly from all sides of the House to the Commission today is that the Commission should tread warily. endTok	33.1115518909023
startTok The Commission should not, for example, take a stepwise jump from 350 grammes to, as some have suggested, as low as 50 grammes. endTok	54.213111180883224
startTok On the contrary, it should proceed cautiously. endTok	43.16302089437675
startTok I imagine anything less than 150 grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances. endTok	38.94489741975765
startTok The solidarity and cohesion of people all over Europe depend on the thought that you can post a letter anywhere and it will be delivered anywhere else, at an affordable stamp price. endTok	89.61523689074242
startTok Stand by universality and affordability! endTok	93.76722238263825
startTok Mr President, the only way to guarantee a high-quality universal postal service is to keep this as a public service. endTok	27.393933107498167
startTok A universal service offering high-quality postal services at affordable prices throughout the country forms the basis for the operation of the whole postal system and must lead to a uniform nationwide tariff. endTok	54.23021419943989
startTok This service must therefore be kept public. endTok	64.16087764212712
startTok This is the only way to guarantee that the network, from collection to distribution, will be a comprehensive network which cannot be broken up or used only in part and according to the convenience of postal service operators. endTok	63.932074156679604
startTok However, further to the directive on common rules for Community postal services, the Commission has undertaken studies which have not been forwarded to the European Parliament. We are therefore unaware of the impacts of the directive' s application on either the level of service provided to the people or the current European postal operators in terms of both economics and employment. endTok	43.960482328261
startTok In our opinion, the whole process of applying this directive must therefore be halted, including its timetable. endTok	46.01245035366543
startTok Any change to the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications, with the objective always being to guarantee a high-quality public service and to retain the current public operators and existing jobs. endTok	73.27734156631476
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to support this proposal on principle while asking right at the outset whether the previous speaker' s statement that on the one hand we need an innovative and highly effective and competitive service while on the other hand this service should be a public service, is not a contradiction in terms. endTok	33.427842551963934
startTok I think ours is a different approach! endTok	25.990540106988423
startTok European policy has liberalised monopoly markets - energy, telecommunications and air transport - and the target, the focus, was always the consumer. endTok	164.37908194485595
startTok The aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liberalising the postal services. endTok	40.95653166672367
startTok I think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs. endTok	111.41028438195659
startTok He does not need a government to do so, or a parliament, nor does he need a Commission to do so! endTok	59.030791433476665
startTok The postal market is limping along behind and, sadly, we have wasted valuable time here. endTok	108.56896129821975
startTok I believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends. endTok	39.849091291259754
startTok I am thinking here of the very sound words of Mr Rübig, who also talked about e-commerce. endTok	51.7671679262408
startTok That will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges. endTok	96.0693332631664
startTok I believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market. endTok	72.69523678719736
startTok It also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of European policy. endTok	22.921510357295094
startTok We should seize that opportunity, for the citizen keeps asking, why do we have Europe? endTok	67.7035055025417
startTok These are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of Europe. endTok	75.2647233234677
startTok I am glad Mr Monti, the Commissioner for competition, is here today in person, for he is pursuing an excellent policy. endTok	62.28930142341106
startTok And here I want to turn to an area where in my view - and this is a point also made in this debate - Parliament and the Commission must consider where to draw limits to competition. endTok	47.884007049997734
startTok We are in favour of competition as a component of the social market economy, and of course we are also in favour of it because we want this economic system to be as successful as possible. endTok	22.812608225729466
startTok Yet I believe that, as this debate has shown, we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas. endTok	36.27364318273122
startTok So I would ask you to give an impetus in that direction, together with Parliament. endTok	25.761886235384488
startTok I have mentioned the example of social services before: nowadays we can reduce everything to attracting the customer, including the pensioner in an old people' s home, and the question is whether we want to subject all that to competition, whether that is the right course. endTok	78.03583916460022
startTok I believe we should use this legislative term to determine the limits, the positive aspects of competition. endTok	35.94087848834149
startTok For competition is not an end in itself; it is there to serve of the citizen, the consumer, which is why we should consider the areas in which we do not want it. endTok	47.82332150927593
startTok Mr President, liberalising postal services could increase competitiveness in the postal sector and guarantee cheaper and more flexible services for the public; it could also address the challenges brought by modern technology. endTok	80.77028935422345
startTok I emphasise the word 'could' , and that is if it is done well and with care. endTok	85.24894273159775
startTok Wrongly done, the threatening images that have been described here will certainly become a reality. endTok	82.56329066864066
startTok Social problems will increase, interregional disparities will grow, and competition will occur only in those areas where the economy is strongest, areas where there are more people and, especially, more businesses. endTok	85.36918845348177
startTok On the other hand, the losers will be the remote areas and their inhabitants, and the people that will not benefit from the new services. endTok	34.13001206411847
startTok Before we decide whether to liberalise postal services, there should be much more discussion about how we can make the present services more flexible and more customer-friendly, and how funding systems can facilitate the investments called for by the new technology. endTok	102.45089022372358
startTok I think this policy has been reasonably successful in Finland, as testified by the present public system. endTok	32.89015460387421
startTok I think, however, that common rules have to be applied to this sector, so that we do not find ourselves at some stage somewhere out in the Wild West, or even the Wild East. We need rules in common based on equality and the principle of a public service. endTok	43.10505024610925
startTok Mr President, a precise assessment of the effects of the first directive is the least we can ask for when approaching the future of the public postal service. endTok	45.38597741604198
startTok It would be obscene to wish to settle the fate of hundreds of thousands of postal workers, millions of service users, in a great rush. endTok	37.04838708314018
startTok But, despite the unfavourable opinion of ten European postal services, a form of unacknowledged privatisation is brewing in the corridors of the Commission. endTok	35.53643641395475
startTok By lowering the price/weight threshold reserved for public postal services and by liberalising mailshots or cross-border post, the second directive may offer the most profitable sectors to the competitive sector. endTok	82.65105195650793
startTok Postal services may then keep whatever does not whet the appetite of the private operators. endTok	68.43970249797727
startTok Whether total or partial, privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse. endTok	285.6804412831613
startTok Just the example of the privatisation of British rail services should suffice to prove the extent to which opting for maximum profit is antipathetic to maintaining a socially useful service. endTok	82.17782353410092
startTok Instead of fighting amongst themselves, public postal services should cooperate, take staff on and guarantee decent, stable working conditions, while meeting the needs of service users in terms of both post delivery and savings bank services. endTok	167.61013912998308
startTok Mr President, today' s debate comes under the sign of the snail, not because I ate such excellent snails here in Strasbourg yesterday but because the snail is a symbol of slow progress. endTok	64.98395890347963
startTok One example of this slow progress is the way the Commission is proceeding. endTok	49.76285203421122
startTok This study is taking far too long and we feel it is important to speed up the pace at last. endTok	38.36581117295878
startTok I am most grateful to the Commissioner for his plain talking today and I would ask the Commission to force the pace now. endTok	27.501838401275002
startTok Today' s debate makes it quite clear that Parliament wants more emphasis on speed, not speed at the expense of quality, but then slowness alone does not mean quality either. endTok	72.2206508924047
startTok This brings me to my second point, namely the snail as symbol of our postal services. endTok	24.17930363401477
startTok What has happened over the past 200 years is that the time it takes for a letter to go from Munich to Brussels has increased fivefold. endTok	46.133600156529056
startTok Letters to Strasbourg arrive there a bit sooner, but it still takes far too long. endTok	156.3357979291964
startTok That means that since the days of mail-coaches and taxis, we have seen a steady decline in the quality of services. endTok	44.26814401860371
startTok It may be true, as was said here, that today we have new possibilities, e.g. electronic possibilities such as e-mail, but on the other hand we must realise that as ever the ordinary letter continues to play a very, very important role and that, in particular, young families, the elderly and many others continue to rely very heavily on conventional mail. endTok	66.26445193730484
startTok So I believe that in relation to conventional mail we must do what Mr Radwan described in such excellent terms, namely encourage competition on the one hand and on the other, define the limits. endTok	45.52166784059733
startTok But what we have often seen in recent years was the very opposite! endTok	39.45946313729884
startTok By embarking on the kind of pseudo and partial privatisations we have also witnessed in Germany, we have combined the drawbacks of the state monopoly with the drawbacks of privatisation, which is really not the purpose of the whole exercise! endTok	38.801076103880966
startTok Some speakers have referred to the social importance of the postman. Let me add to that, the importance of the post offices. endTok	36.03176434213908
startTok They have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas. endTok	38.6084986128296
startTok I come from Munich, a very densely populated urban conglomeration, but we have the same problem there. endTok	52.24645053814185
startTok One urban district post office after another is being closed down. endTok	186.05729583963102
startTok We have a disproportionately large number of old people in these large cities, who are becoming increasingly lonely with the decline in the number of retail shops. endTok	27.391164009078302
startTok That is why we must define certain minimum standards here too and realise that it is important to provide the necessary services for the people. endTok	32.38475656476379
startTok For if there is only one letter box left in the inner city of Munich where the mail is collected again in the evening, that reflects a rapid decline in quality, while at the same time prices are sometimes rising, which is something else we must note. endTok	79.49273745124628
startTok So, yes to liberalisation, but let us also think about the limits to liberalisation, rapidly create reasonable conditions in Europe and submit the appropriate study to the Commission. endTok	114.98684537358426
startTok I would hope that in future the symbol of European postal policy will no longer be the snail but that our post will finally be dispatched post-haste. endTok	47.23492396383574
startTok That is a term that harks back to the time when the post was still the symbol of speed. endTok	70.93023692622397
startTok Like Mr Radwan, I am glad that Commissioner Monti is here rather than Commissioner Bolkestein because I believe that he can explain to us certain aspects relating to competition. endTok	28.14326771435631
startTok I do not know if Mr Monti is aware of the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of last week, 10 February, which recognised the possibility of the German postal service being in a dominant position as a result of its holding a postal monopoly. endTok	47.8626744826846
startTok Competition policy will no doubt have to be applied to this sector before the coming liberalisation - before 1 January 2003 - because at the moment the tendency is to divert mail via countries with lower postage rates. endTok	59.60721721307994
startTok This has consequences for free competition between the different postal administrations. endTok	62.23271540872424
startTok In the event that liberalisation is brought about throughout the European Union, what consequences would that have for free competition? endTok	120.15036172363496
startTok For the moment, it appears that, in the only country where liberalisation has taken place - Sweden - there has been a 59% increase in the price of postal services. endTok	32.97947413909543
startTok We do not know what will happen in each of the countries where liberalisation is going to take place. endTok	24.007680827551578
startTok It is likely that postal liberalisation will lead to greater cost differences between countries, which will no doubt have implications for competition, which will not only affect the cost of the postal service but also the establishment of installations. endTok	36.12225132721596
startTok For example, there are currently companies which set up in Holland because the postal charges are lower than in Germany and the same may happen in the future. endTok	41.81309675631029
startTok I therefore wonder whether the Commission' s package on postal liberalisation will include the preservation of free competition, because it is very possible that - as has happened in most sectors in the Community today - it will lead to concentrations of large companies which will cancel out the benefits of this theoretical liberalisation. endTok	43.29110544619299
startTok At the moment, in services which are not theoretically liberalised - as is the case with national postal services - there is a basic form of liberalisation, which is agreed within the framework of the Universal Postal Union, allowing for lower tariffs. endTok	62.642145180437566
startTok In a service which is theoretically liberalised, free competition may disappear as a result of the concentration of the service amongst large companies abusing their dominant position, agreements between companies and other similar circumstances. endTok	94.41805856463564
startTok I would therefore advise Commissioner Monti to deal with the issue of postal liberalisation, taking strict account of free competition, because I believe that this will probably become a very worrying issue in the future. endTok	35.11749254482293
startTok My prediction is that the liberalised postal services will probably be much less competitive than the current public postal services. endTok	53.5582130853924
startTok Mr President, the postal service is not a normal service provider like a hairdresser' s or a fitness centre. endTok	33.44401722609863
startTok For us in Finland, a sparsely populated country, a visit to the post office is a social event. endTok	42.82387669532738
startTok In the world of networking, the mail service is the most democratic of all networks. endTok	66.87228045320904
startTok It creates and maintains interpersonal relationships. endTok	48.83498912837631
startTok The common market in postal services will be created on the terms of the marketeers. endTok	25.86407199624354
startTok For us in the north it will mean that the EU will be destroying the social infrastructure. endTok	36.2869986321332
startTok Commissioner Monti, the principle of competition cannot be applied to interpersonal relationships: postal services must be improved, not run down. endTok	46.48140958279192
startTok Only a public mail service can guarantee that information technology is within everyone' s reach in society. endTok	146.26153944580224
startTok The post office is democracy. endTok	38.661721657954395
startTok It is better suited to handling such matters than telecommunications companies. endTok	33.24918407360695
startTok Telecommunications costs have risen as a consequence of companies being bought and sold and marketing costs accounting for more than 50% of companies' turnover. endTok	51.198827378950675
startTok Democratic investments have to be made to preserve a democratic post office. endTok	58.60772915790023
startTok It is particularly appropriate that Mr Monti is responding to this debate because the great conundrum with postal services is how to square an open market and free and fair competition with providing a service which is universally available to all, even in the remotest and least inhabited region of the European Union. endTok	42.81698549456398
startTok In the hills and glens of Scotland and the rural borders and central belt, on the beautiful but fragile islands of the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland, there is real concern at possibly losing this essential service. endTok	49.28940411330817
startTok Yet we all know that service quality can only improve if postal services, like all service industries, are given the financial and management freedom of the private sector and the spur of open, even international, competition. endTok	104.97780943470185
startTok I would suggest that there is a solution. endTok	15.360556236361914
startTok It is already employed widely in the transport sector. endTok	33.31143133508979
startTok Air routes, ferry routes, train routes, bus routes, within and to these remoter areas are put out to tender. The bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract. endTok	69.5793536413475
startTok Let us call this a negative tender franchise. endTok	50.954836133915144
startTok This permits desirable competition in providing these services under a publicly-supported but fully transparent franchise system. endTok	185.05631971781776
startTok Why could not mail collection and delivery in a certain region be put to negative tender in this manner? endTok	74.51342915852031
startTok The lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time. endTok	39.20978131504665
startTok Why could not the sub-post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender? endTok	53.55722986039171
startTok It would therefore be up to the appropriate democratically accountable government body, local, regional or national - probably under overall EU supervision - to set the service criteria and the financial resources for meeting this particular social purpose. endTok	133.37301847978583
startTok Otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace. endTok	29.328649431681402
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, it is no coincidence that I am the fifth Member of this House from Scotland to rise to speak in this debate. endTok	24.27527566922631
startTok That is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services. endTok	39.47277751788115
startTok Scotland as a country is larger than some Member States. endTok	38.14737097159173
startTok It has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road, sometimes served poorly by public transport, sometimes not at all. endTok	98.89205974742977
startTok Such communities rely for their survival on having local facilities, such as a school, a post office and a shop. endTok	75.82447395076774
startTok It is on the last two that the elderly, in particular, depend. endTok	56.995867407326095
startTok Often they are located together, each service being made more viable by the existence of the other. endTok	113.89154755226845
startTok Scotland also has many island communities, some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea ferries. endTok	93.59421378906731
startTok It has been calculated that the actual cost of carrying a letter from Edinburgh to the Central Highlands is about ten times that of carrying the same letter across London. endTok	53.86727503909456
startTok And it is about four times the postage cost actually charged. endTok	81.11128074552828
startTok The more remote the community, the greater the difference becomes. endTok	235.5452631605216
startTok That is the measure of the problem. endTok	25.89989934323678
startTok It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service. endTok	36.857038488557635
startTok It is for all our remote and island communities, no matter where in the European Union they are situated, and not just for the people of Scotland, that I ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide. endTok	46.678866327136674
startTok . Mr President, I consider it a privilege that I am replacing my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, on the occasion of such a high-quality debate on postal services. endTok	24.61743597424075
startTok I will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein. endTok	17.33460862681976
startTok May I repeat that on Monday he will be available to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of Parliament. endTok	20.848574285822373
startTok Some Members, like Mr Stenmarck, complain that there have been delays with the new proposal. endTok	32.42078793354335
startTok Others believe that it is not so bad after all, if there is a slight pause after the first step of liberalisation. endTok	50.40539962465394
startTok This is, for example, the position expressed by Mr Berthu. endTok	19.03151295582399
startTok The Commission' s position is that the new proposal was delayed mainly owing to the internal problems of the Commission, of which I am sure Parliament is not totally unaware. endTok	29.132685082381126
startTok But we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made. endTok	15.249499318088478
startTok It is Commissioner Bolkestein' s intention to present such a proposal to the Commission for adoption in the first half of this year. endTok	25.93426138823904
startTok The scheduled date of 1 January 2003 for implementation of the next steps remains feasible. endTok	59.47272971080394
startTok The proposal will take account of the studies undertaken and in particular look at such issues as universal service, to which I will come back in a second. endTok	47.26973538715971
startTok As regards the existing directive and its implementation, most Member States have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive. endTok	49.21528436944123
startTok A number of problems exist as regards the structure of the regulator and its independence. endTok	26.292018480205595
startTok The implementation deadline for the Member States is January 2003. endTok	41.5098179144887
startTok Further liberalisation will occur afterwards. endTok	151.3148743818283
startTok In some areas competition is already taking place, as in the parcels sector and in the express services. endTok	62.27041390873781
startTok The quality of services has, generally speaking, improved, in particular in regard to cross-border activity. endTok	80.01736177138244
startTok The quality of services, which is so relevant to consumers, was a main concern of all speakers, some of whom, like Mr Rübig, were very explicit on this point. endTok	99.19937651360618
startTok The experiences in countries where liberalisation is more advanced such as Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, prove that when liberalisation takes place in an orderly way, the quality of service may be raised as a result of higher-quality service requirements imposed by the national regulations and their follow-up. endTok	55.38503363596437
startTok So this is not a selling-out of the service and of its quality. endTok	34.73795752305991
startTok Frequently liberalisation leads to guaranteed standards and the on-going standardisation of the measurement of the quality of service also contributes, as these standards will better reflect actual performance. endTok	110.84351062443747
startTok This will allow for meaningful bench-marking and improved customer orientation by the incumbent operator as a result of the combined pressure by regulators, competitors and customers. endTok	40.76330414643029
startTok We can see in the incumbent operators, in public post offices, a change of culture that I believe nobody can consider negative if the current trend towards concentrating on customers' needs continues. endTok	131.19373566794792
startTok The concerns expressed in this Parliament this morning by honourable Members will be at the core of the activity of my colleague and of the Commission as a whole in the preparation of the further proposal. endTok	29.79047294314027
startTok That proposal will fully take into account the need to ensure universality of service, the development of efficient safeguards for consumers, and the creation of a climate which would be favourable to new jobs - not to fewer jobs - in the framework of a progressive, gradual evolution. endTok	39.86205244036718
startTok The issue of universal service was mentioned by Mrs Isler Béguin, by Mr Miller, whom I thank for his personal message, and by many others. endTok	35.28660759816665
startTok We are all aware of the extremely important aspect of social and structural cohesion, especially in the sparsely populated rural areas, one of which has been particularly strongly and overwhelmingly represented in the debate this morning. endTok	33.503633651119756
startTok We believe that the universal service is a pillar and I am sure that my colleague will be able to provide reassurances to the appropriate parliamentary committee. endTok	21.073600123219368
startTok Mrs Gillig, but others like Mr Markov and Mr Ésclope, voiced concerns about employment. endTok	44.137242383672245
startTok Experience in other sectors show a sort of U-curve pattern: a phase of reduction in employment starts just before liberalisation takes place, as, of course, the incumbent prepares itself to be competitive; then a second phase of steady employment, as new jobs in newcomer operators balance further potential employment reductions; finally, a third phase of net job creation, both in the incumbent and new operators as the benefits of liberalisation reach users and the market develops more quickly. endTok	95.61889483554312
startTok In the postal sector the first phase is already in progress, as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation. endTok	44.74263829223001
startTok The new technologies and logistics rather than the process of postal liberalisation are the most important factors impacting on employment. endTok	46.66931852822575
startTok On the availability of the studies, - a point raised by Mr Staes and others - copies of each of the studies were handed to Parliament in September 1999. endTok	42.473258422604104
startTok They have all been available on the Commission' s Internet website since August 1999 and the Commission is willing to provide copies to anybody who is interested. endTok	36.51584851442095
startTok The studies have been the object of some criticism, especially on the part of the public postal services. endTok	31.28691230777405
startTok I am aware that all the studies launched experienced difficulty in collecting adequate data. endTok	78.51340142999875
startTok This was no surprise, since the universal service operators do not always have the systems in place for detailed letter collection. endTok	98.43983909503396
startTok Does that not say a lot about management ability? endTok	132.26413037277675
startTok No single methodology for accessing the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all the parties. endTok	54.03670840656342
startTok Nevertheless, Mr Bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decision-making process. endTok	35.82938947734153
startTok I finally come to three interventions about a subject I am supposed to know better than postal services, that is competition. endTok	93.99924970575904
startTok Mr Purvis, I found your methodologically provocative remark about the tender interesting and certainly worth exploring. endTok	67.45608562513132
startTok Mr Medina Ortega, I am as convinced as you are that we must be even more vigilant after liberalisation, because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise, through unchecked concentration, to private operators. endTok	52.40238934591011
startTok This applies both to the post and other sectors. endTok	44.624673110828795
startTok If I can provide one example of this sort of vigilance, it is the case of Deutsche Post where, following complaints and an action before the court, the Commission initiated a formal state aid procedure in July. endTok	90.34191711007378
startTok We have just received the reply of the German Government to the observations made. endTok	44.3461459646047
startTok The state aid procedure covers the question of cross-subsidisation between monopoly letter services and commercial business parcel activities as well as the financing of Deutsche Post' s numerous recent acquisitions. endTok	111.98091734743377
startTok I will not go into the details due to lack of time, but this is perhaps one illustration of the fact that the Commission does not stop its work as liberalisation progresses. endTok	32.72263079254056
startTok In a sense this is where its work begins. endTok	72.56013903136451
startTok Finally, Mr Radwan, of course, there should be limits to competition and there are limits to competition. endTok	32.15146543094526
startTok In particular, if we take the issue of competition and services of general interest, where a Member State defines a mission of public service, it is important to quantify the costs for discharging that mission and state aids that compensate for those costs are certainly not a violation of competition. endTok	54.49464426802737
startTok I would slightly disagree with the terminology you used when you said, Mr Radwan, that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition. endTok	40.91162846383367
startTok That concept I reject firmly, because competition is there for the citizens, and for them alone. endTok	124.28389401073909
startTok Most companies hate competition. endTok	245.81566560878875
startTok Competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens, their economic interest and for their liberty. endTok	85.41581092515547
startTok The examples of liberalisation and competition in air transport and in telephony services in Europe show that citizens have benefited from this. endTok	85.23000199961508
startTok I can only say again that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on Monday, in the appropriate committee, more competently and in much more detail. endTok	39.386243852181536
startTok Thank you very much, Commissioner. endTok	6.573406575229789
startTok Pursuant to Rule 42(5), I have received a motion for a resolution to close the present debate. endTok	34.727449033421614
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok We shall now proceed to the vote. endTok	14.539435159860203
startTok (Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE endTok	46.988577356346724
startTok We voted in favour of the resolution because we received a request to this effect from a French postal service trade union which was looking to obtain, in the event of a favourable vote, an additional time frame in which to defend employees. endTok	71.43863878649597
startTok This does not mean that we approve the entire contents, which are too vague and which leave out the main concern. endTok	45.763367916596955
startTok The policy undertaken by the European institutions and by national governments, especially the French government, is a retrograde policy, counter to the interests of both the service users, i.e. the great majority of the population, and the postal service workers. endTok	38.082705523614756
startTok Postal services must continue to be public services. endTok	46.347233981859766
startTok All people, regardless of their location or social status, must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions. endTok	53.52715445302868
startTok In organising the public service no consideration must be given to the idea of profitability, and private firms must not be authorised to amass private profits by carrying off the most profitable public service activities. endTok	53.90879947981335
startTok Consequently, the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of Europe must keep their monopoly of this service. endTok	44.11371891651371
startTok In order to ensure that we have proper postal services on the European Union level, it is essential to put an end to the policy of closing down local post offices, reducing the number of deliveries and overworking postal staff. endTok	32.478797195593344
startTok The post office and, more generally, all public services must, on the other hand, recruit additional staff. endTok	66.21846215802928
startTok Such jobs are unquestionably useful, and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in Europe. endTok	80.69060413770295
startTok Mr President, personally I voted in favour of this resolution, because the essential thing is that the European Parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation. endTok	24.9172525303194
startTok If we dismantle the public service, this would be very serious, and we wish to know what are the Commission' s intentions. endTok	27.123176250624187
startTok Saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate. endTok	54.87371458579367
startTok People who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so. endTok	52.48075842071426
startTok Postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service. endTok	82.88702710382418
startTok Occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day. endTok	110.07451767920297
startTok We can salute them, these postmen who, whatever the weather, sometimes walk for miles to be able to offer this service to everyone. endTok	56.05197859682362
startTok Dismantling the postal service, the local communication service, would be a serious mistake and we would be unable to maintain the principle of the equality of all citizens. endTok	54.21033228832551
startTok Profitability at all costs means going against fraternity and against social cohesion. endTok	155.27969962585286
startTok Mr President, I voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives. endTok	21.034456735805918
startTok Several speakers mentioned that the only person with whom many elderly people have any contact is the postman, particularly in mountain communities. endTok	79.0166405495917
startTok I wholeheartedly agree. endTok	51.37450248371726
startTok However, it also seems to me that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced as a result of national budget constraints. endTok	35.64579853007011
startTok In my own country, Italy, there are some 200 000 postal workers who cost the state approximately ITL 50 million a year per capita, or EUR 25 000, that is, a total cost of around EUR 5 million. endTok	61.83132743416135
startTok Liberalisation of postal services would mean that the state could give each pensioner an extra ITL 10 million a year so that a million pensioners would see their pensions doubled. endTok	114.92293136239948
startTok That should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman. endTok	73.76101678705601
startTok Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on European postal services with all the more satisfaction since it reiterates once again the position I have always defended in this House, which is the need for a high quality universal service, particularly ensuring this service in the least populated regions and rural regions, and there are some even in my small country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. endTok	38.25452435259749
startTok In these regions but also in some districts of towns and cities, as Mr Posselt explained so clearly, post offices and postmen have an almost socio-cultural role, I might say, which goes beyond merely delivering mail. endTok	111.65306215267935
startTok I know that this service is unprofitable. endTok	17.51491990006583
startTok It would perhaps be less costly to make a fax or email available to isolated houses or villages. endTok	39.32674423527274
startTok In principle, I am in favour of abolishing public sector monopolies, whether in water, gas, electricity, telephone, satellite, cable or any other services. endTok	98.29724556041562
startTok Nonetheless, liberalisation, which has a lot to offer to the consumer in terms of the price and the quality of the service, especially in the telephone sector, must cease as soon as the service provided becomes inadequate or disappears, when the firms profiting from liberalisation are not making money. endTok	72.34952751982519
startTok If they cannot be obliged to provide what the state monopoly was able to guarantee, particularly thanks to its obligation to provide a universal service, then the public service must be protected. endTok	50.117048442513294
startTok I feel we can still afford to maintain a postal service, even if our post offices operate like businesses. endTok	88.00504162267629
startTok They clearly have to make some effort so that they are no longer described as snail mail even if they cannot attain the speed of email. endTok	44.44634248575726
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok (FR) Here indeed is a sector which has highlighted the limitations and serious deficiencies of liberalisation. endTok	101.62559798866005
startTok I am not, personally, a blinkered militant in favour of monopolies, whether public or private, but when I see the results achieved by private firms in this sector I am reinforced in my position as a defender of public service! endTok	50.05241111420766
startTok If liberalisation continues in this area too, then there is a great risk that one day we will see entire regions with no postal service. endTok	75.74370849940478
startTok For who can believe for one moment that private firms, motivated only by profit, will continue to provide services in high-cost areas unless the costs are borne by the already disadvantaged inhabitants who are not, therefore, in a position to take advantage of the service. endTok	85.01889092177157
startTok I should add that today, at a time when Europe is revealing itself and is proving to be incapable of opposing the inclusion of Fascists in a government within the European Union, it is no longer acceptable to have an ultraliberalism which destroys public services foisted on us in the name of this same Europe. endTok	35.18967199202923
startTok I am a European and even a federalist. endTok	70.83218663583615
startTok To achieve this I was ready and I am ready to make certain sacrifices, but not just anything! Most especially, I am no longer ready to accept the formation of a liberal single market if Europe is not at the same time capable of defending the values on which it is based and which, in the 1960s, made me a committed European! endTok	59.62671853658795
startTok President. endTok	1057.4422134367323
startTok Parliament has completed the agenda. endTok	56.29258817120045
startTok The Minutes of this sitting will be submitted for approval by Parliament at the beginning of the next part-session. endTok	19.511606485182014

startTok I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned. endTok	12.508029070915894

startTok Statement by the President endTok	101.65210844302571
startTok Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on 22 February, ETA struck again in a brutal attack in Spain with the murder of Fernando Buesa Blanco, the General Secretary of the Socialist Party of Vizcaya and the spokesman of the Socialist Party of the Basque Parliament, and Jorge Díez Elorza, his bodyguard. endTok	22.531029238692252
startTok The same day, I conveyed my own and the European Parliament' s deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims' families. endTok	41.31220709694276
startTok These men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy. endTok	95.49755336073343
startTok I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society. endTok	82.28114206259488
startTok The rule of law and the respect of rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is based. endTok	38.06140160587658
startTok Terrorism, whatever form it takes, is unacceptable. endTok	288.1439710391069
startTok In expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of ETA, I call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in Spain. endTok	62.52125818955866
startTok I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to observe one minute' s silence in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco and Jorge Díez Elorza. endTok	19.632684222019737
startTok (The House rose and observed a minute' s silence) endTok	33.05170326724384
startTok Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I want to thank you for your statement last Tuesday and for your words today in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco. endTok	16.45872735815499
startTok He was a member of the Basque regional parliament, spokesman for the Socialist Party in that parliament and also a former vice-president of the Basque regional government. endTok	41.46653248782156
startTok Madam President, the best tribute that my Group and this House can pay to Fernando Buesa is to take on board his vision, as a European, of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe. endTok	62.663535825161574
startTok The following is a translated extract from his autobiography. 'We are in Europe. endTok	51.31007834112153
startTok Anyone of my age - I am 54 - can remember their grandparents' era and their parents' era and, of course, is living in the current era. We can also see into the era in which our children will live. endTok	74.63593325883915
startTok In my grandparents' time, it took several days to travel from Vitoria to Seville. endTok	48.15312666950414
startTok Now you can go from Vitoria to Copenhagen in 2 or 3 hours by plane. endTok	49.396623821834325
startTok Today, at the end of the 20th century, a single market is operating in Europe in which we will soon be using a single currency. endTok	28.023289880757332
startTok We can now travel much more easily than our grandparents could within Spain or even within the Basque Country. endTok	77.10764603257061
startTok We are building a vast European area which will firstly be linked economically and then politically. endTok	93.86998141346463
startTok This process may take a long time but it is unstoppable and, what is more, desirable. endTok	36.44449383224067
startTok The public still regard this as being a long way off but it is very real and should serve to make us question certain aspects of our current situation. endTok	106.9611114921847
startTok In a debate within the Socialist Party on the Irish process, someone said: "In the end, the key to the Irish solution was that everyone involved had the following thought: does it really matter whether we are Irish or British? endTok	124.78942681632255
startTok Everyone can be what they want to be because, if Ireland and Britain are both in the European Union, there is no point in killing each other for being Irish or British. endTok	71.28887768918801
startTok What difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function?" endTok	58.78509297029463
startTok We in the Basque Country could ask ourselves the same question. Does it really matter if we are Basque or Spanish or European? endTok	83.31716819803283
startTok We have talked a lot about what it is to be Basque, but a Basque today dresses like a Dane and reads the same things as a British person. endTok	53.15331813409757
startTok If life is going to be lived on a much more global basis, as is already happening, and our children will therefore be living in the Europe which we are creating, why are we killing each other for being Basque or Spanish?' endTok	68.80549869949255
startTok Fernando Buesa also said the following, which everyone in Ireland has probably thought. 'If we are killing each other for no reason - and this was happening in Ireland because there were paramilitary groups on all sides - we should be resolutely asking ourselves this question in the Basque Country too. endTok	93.84527676117567
startTok What difference does it make to be Basque? Surely it is all the same thing. endTok	42.63226660867514
startTok You can be what you want to be. endTok	57.641132113574784
startTok If, in the future, economics and politics and vital decisions for each country are dealt with in the European arena, there is no point killing or dying for being Basque or Spanish' . endTok	73.41335458631846
startTok May he rest in peace. endTok	301.6861692527263
startTok (Loud applause) endTok	24.314994226401275
startTok Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, I want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of Fernando Buesa, an elected representative of the Basque people, and Jorge Díez, a member of the Basque police force. We also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the Basque Socialist Party. endTok	19.557388579863336
startTok In recent times, in this House, we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in Europe. endTok	44.960034523876935
startTok It does not matter what banner these come under because, in the end, they are all different expressions of the same thing. endTok	72.23174061550874
startTok Faced with these, we democrats cannot resign ourselves to the peace of the dead. endTok	95.60439683858442
startTok On the contrary, we must take strength from knowing that the only social division which exists in the Basque Country is the abyss which separates those who kill, and those who support and express understanding for the latter, from the vast majority of the Basque people who simply want to live in peace and freedom. endTok	33.91768331470383
startTok (Loud applause) endTok	24.314994226401275
startTok Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must indicate my complete and categorical condemnation of the terrorist attack on 22 February in Vitoria which took the lives of the socialist MP and spokesman in the Basque parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez. endTok	16.406506497030698
startTok In a country governed by the rule of law and which is a member of the European Union, it should be possible for all ideas and options to be defended, provided that this occurs democratically and with respect for the rights of the individual and the principles and values of justice, freedom and economic and social progress on which the Union is based. The transgression of these principles is simply not acceptable, as clearly indicated in the Treaties. endTok	38.182057031486195
startTok There is no justification in our society for terrorist acts such as the one which took the lives of Fernando Buesa and Jorge Díez, particularly when the former was a freely elected representative of the Basque people. endTok	38.963425774145115
startTok We pray that these are the last victims in a process which, as you said, Madam President, has seen much barbarism. We pray that a way forward can be found which will allow the Basque people to live together in peace. endTok	48.01030210574493
startTok Madam President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I must add my voice to those of my colleagues who have expressed their grief at the truly perverse and cruel outrage which has occurred in the Basque Country. We send our condolences to the families of the victims and emphatically condemn these acts which have been going on for so long and which must stop. endTok	20.095284424780196
startTok The terrorist organisation ETA has, in its time, killed police officers and soldiers. endTok	86.39505949473099
startTok It has placed a bomb in a supermarket and killed men, women and children. endTok	65.07146241862547
startTok In the streets of Madrid it has killed a general, Quintana Lacaci, who defended democracy at the time of the attempted coup of 1981. endTok	51.807369909484905
startTok It has assassinated the spokesman of the Popular Party in the town council of San Sebastián, Gregorio Ordóñez. endTok	24.415387195087455
startTok It has been to the lecture room of the university professor in Constitutional Law, Francisco Tomás y Valiente, and killed him in cold blood. Now, just a few days ago, in the same odious way in which it assassinated Admiral Blanco, it has killed the socialist MP and spokesman in the Vitoria parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez, of the Basque police force. endTok	38.860753234268
startTok ETA must be condemned. However, those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned. endTok	99.66235709874938
startTok There is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road. endTok	66.92568091617973
startTok We must appeal to the whole of society and particularly to the democratic parties, whether they are national or nationalist, and no matter how pro- or anti-European they are. endTok	86.2689259676074
startTok It is regrettable that there are organisations and people who are saying nothing or simply regretting the deaths as if they were the result of a road traffic accident. endTok	51.28317219101939
startTok All European democrats in this House must join together to send a message to the Basque Country that it is time to put an end to the division and killing. It is time to share the Basque Country, Spain and Europe. endTok	35.88577086803638
startTok This, Madam President, is the only way forward which we therefore fully support. endTok	29.08288482615732
startTok Madam President, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, I would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it. endTok	19.396773265070845
startTok For the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy, but I feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy, in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others, democracy and democratic life. endTok	71.1380736810225
startTok So, Madam President, maybe we should consider taking some action if we want our sorrow and our rejection of terrorism to have any actual significance. endTok	62.052701423263436
startTok Why does Parliament not meet in all the countries of the European Union and show that it rejects terrorism? endTok	35.027676826592774
startTok Let us make ourselves heard! endTok	78.03327169008048
startTok We are not just confined to Brussels or Strasbourg. endTok	39.89862102584133
startTok Let us all go back to our respective nations and shout from the rooftops that our belief in democracy and our indignation are not just words, but a demonstration of our actual political commitment. endTok	53.00199334280869
startTok Madam President, as a member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and also as an MEP for the Basque Nationalist Party, I must firstly categorically condemn the cowardly attack which took the lives of a Basque police officer, Jorge Díez Elorza, and the Basque MP and former vice-president, Fernando Buesa. endTok	25.956976076039275
startTok Secondly, we send our deepest condolences to their families, their socialist colleagues, the Basque parliament and the Basque police force. We also want to express our solidarity and heartfelt sympathy. endTok	46.542434026650746
startTok Thirdly, we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which, by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people, not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people. endTok	72.22044426776067
startTok Fourthly, we express our repulsion at the fact that this dual assassination was intended to directly destroy the political process aimed at achieving peace in the Basque Country. endTok	39.918221738234706
startTok Fifthly, we again call on the Spanish and French leaders and politicians to show the same tolerance as in the United Kingdom and Ireland in order to resolve the current Basque conflict with something more than police measures which, on their own, cannot bring about the peace which we all desire. endTok	86.10815103815382
startTok Sixthly and finally, we reaffirm that ETA' s terrorism and violence must end. ETA must stop hijacking the will of the Basque people who must be allowed to decide on their future freely and without violent coercion. endTok	51.7970201019196
startTok Just three months ago I took the floor in this House to congratulate the Irish and British people on their success in reaching the Northern Ireland settlement, as many other colleagues did. endTok	50.64386200959102
startTok In Northern Ireland in the last thirty years too many people have been killed and injured - too many families shattered. endTok	32.624725995272094
startTok So far, unfortunately, in Spain and France, just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country. endTok	83.61997323532046
startTok We, Euskal Herritarrok, are convinced that a definitive solution to the present struggle can only be found through an open process of dialogue and negotiation with no limited agenda. endTok	63.928842808356876
startTok Before 20 January last, during nineteen months, the only killing we witnessed in the Kingdom of Spain was that of José Luis Geresta, member of ETA, in March 1999. endTok	121.27768437791003
startTok In spite of that and the arrests made by the Spanish and French police, including arrests of ETA negotiators with the Spanish government' s agreement, ETA honoured its unilateral ceasefire. endTok	50.081644605090716
startTok Then, last November, before the ceasefire was over, the Spanish Government spokesman, Mr Piqué, declared that his government had done and would in the future do everything possible to hinder present moves towards a political solution in the Basque country. endTok	65.2340994764787
startTok We, Euskal Herritarrok, have regretted many times the loss of human lives. endTok	44.81300289975881
startTok We share with all the Basque citizens the sufferings of our people. endTok	34.47835860900309
startTok We are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those eager to find a democratic settlement for the Basque country. endTok	38.75048819946614
startTok Twenty years have passed since the Northern Ireland question was first raised in this Parliament. endTok	90.8219611485087
startTok May I ask: Quousque tandem - Noiz arte? endTok	48.72968557601592
startTok Thank you, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, I should like to assure you of my empathy and sincere respect. endTok	16.243398602307884
startTok Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting endTok	14.546692295191853
startTok The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed. endTok	9.865839509254945
startTok Are there any comments? endTok	12.892323309345828
startTok We are about to discuss the subject of reforming the Commission and you will recall, Madam President, that at the beginning of the last session, I raised with you the question of whether, in the interests of openness and transparency, the Members' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the Internet. endTok	47.88074206035524
startTok You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening. endTok	125.81218879025188
startTok I wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to Parliament that the Quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the Internet and, if so, whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 April - for doing so. endTok	73.31183680470988
startTok I can tell you, Mr Davies, that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve. endTok	39.39810572876092
startTok But we shall have a decision very soon. endTok	67.35516131532648
startTok (The Minutes were adopted) endTok	27.468981500801696
startTok Reforming the Commission endTok	57.717427154838454
startTok The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European Commission. endTok	9.829035250746864
startTok I shall give the floor straight away to the President, Mr Romano Prodi. endTok	17.23649555875302
startTok - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, here in your presence, I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission. endTok	30.825685980733557
startTok I would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last July: the outgoing Commission had been in crisis, I had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination. endTok	48.38068003212823
startTok The climax of the chain of events was my undertaking to reform the Commission, to reform it thoroughly, completely revolutionising the Commission' s way of working. endTok	59.05984739527914
startTok Today, that commitment has been fully discharged: you have the reform here, before you, in the form of an institutional White Paper which has just been adopted by the Commission. endTok	50.5699600523222
startTok I would like to emphasise that, on that occasion too, the Commission voted unanimously, with one voice. endTok	25.92878982488153
startTok Briefly, these are the main points of the reform. endTok	37.384827284985704
startTok One: definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources. endTok	92.73182480669719
startTok This is at the heart of the system, and it is this, the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources, which will enable the political sphere to assert its primacy and to take its responsibilities fully on board. endTok	35.789877089583854
startTok In order to do this, we have created a completely new policy-planning mechanism, a system which will allow the College to set annual policy guidelines and to establish the budgetary procedure on the basis of these, to assign well-defined objectives to the Directorates-General and to keep the relationship between available resources and activities assigned under control, which is of fundamental importance. endTok	59.206781686893684
startTok In this context, activity-based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives, actions and resources. endTok	83.4573694999403
startTok The second point is human resources. endTok	26.038248299844685
startTok It is the central part of our reform. Our staff are the Commission' s best asset, its richest resource. endTok	59.73266576192904
startTok They are extremely highly qualified, of a calibre which it is difficult, if not impossible, to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used. endTok	64.88116422795059
startTok This was the impression I received when I first became President of the Commission, and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work. endTok	54.46917186074167
startTok However, at the same time, I have found that morale amongst the Commission' s staff is very low. endTok	24.986766815514354
startTok Previously, there was pride and pleasure taken in being part of a universally admired institution, but now staff are frequently demoralised by the unceasing criticism. endTok	111.34474795398869
startTok All this has to change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform. endTok	31.793986019432737
startTok Recruitment, career development, mobility and disciplinary measures are all being based on completely new criteria: there will be greater emphasis on individual service, credible and, above all, verifiable performance appraisal systems, lifelong learning and a greater degree of management responsibility. endTok	97.51322431214847
startTok These are the areas in which changes will be made. endTok	29.64173346974412
startTok The third point, which was also rather a sensitive, key issue in the recent crisis, is financial management. endTok	96.1172160441643
startTok This is the hub of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security. endTok	33.78524942265104
startTok We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General. endTok	26.728371214738278
startTok At the moment, our control system is completely centralised; with the reform we will switch to a control system which combines decentralisation of management control with an efficient central audit system. endTok	86.16027139504673
startTok This means that we will have a central financial service to provide financial management guidance and advice, decentralisation in every Directorate-General of the entire chain, that is of programmes, undertakings, contracts, expenditure and the related ex ante control systems, and an external auditing service which will direct these operations. endTok	87.39778609585657
startTok This is a complete revolution of the Commission' s way of working; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking. endTok	50.19469231413777
startTok We are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage, and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff: we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place. endTok	55.53254270447194
startTok In fact, the Commission desires this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of Europe and the world. endTok	26.015456288972757
startTok We also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology. endTok	33.555035165655234
startTok We want to be a model of a completely computerised administration. endTok	33.95848049782774
startTok The Commission has been accused of being buried under piles of paper, and so we are going to become a paperless Commission. endTok	30.702126013751016
startTok This will make the Commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the Commission. endTok	45.87170964334825
startTok This is not just a technical revolution, but a complete organisational revolution as well. endTok	40.64242723278369
startTok I shall leave to Neil Kinnock the task of explaining the details of the reform, but I would first like to thank him for the intelligence, enthusiasm and energy he has brought to this exercise. endTok	37.65522983912333
startTok We would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the Commission staff, who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the Commission. endTok	43.30438080659231
startTok I would stress that this style of debate is something very new and, in my opinion, it has forced us to radically change our way of thinking as well. endTok	60.319971884804865
startTok The White Paper before us is also the product of contributions from the Commission staff: they knew that the Commission would have to undergo substantial reform in order to become, once again, that internationally-admired institution which was at the heart of European history. endTok	46.79513200502124
startTok The adoption of the White Paper marks the end of a chapter of history - and I hope that it will remain closed forever. endTok	30.003606659984307
startTok Now we can focus on the future, on the challenges awaiting the Union and on the programme for 2000-2005, the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks. endTok	34.57934440295152
startTok The very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five-year plan. endTok	28.78852207074077
startTok We need - the whole Union needs - a strong Commission, a Commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions. endTok	56.61532330533757
startTok This is why we are redefining all our work priorities. endTok	26.793724913250873
startTok This is why we are offloading all the activities which it is no longer appropriate for us to carry out - another important area of reform - in accordance with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity. endTok	33.54480454165652
startTok For this reason, we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently. endTok	23.769843375525472
startTok We will make the best use of the resources at the Commission' s disposal, but they are very limited and we have almost exhausted them. endTok	34.356945604015316
startTok We may need to come back to you and ask for additional resources to fund the new tasks which have been assigned to us and those which will be assigned to us in the future. endTok	32.65561284151751
startTok In September, we undertook to present a White Paper on reform, and today we are fulfilling that undertaking according to the conditions established in your presence. endTok	49.38451847446653
startTok The Commission wishes to be judged on results and results alone - on what we achieve. endTok	69.51458712783541
startTok I would, however, remind you, and this is my final point, that the Commission is not the only Community institution. endTok	26.473728110922544
startTok Parliament and the Council are also called upon to take up all the challenges presented by these reforms. endTok	44.46745639214502
startTok The Commission has resolutely forged a path, and I hope that all the institutions will follow it right to the very end, in the service of the citizens of Europe, to achieve an ever-stronger and ever more transparent Europe. endTok	45.73759286969775
startTok I am glad to be here together with President Prodi and my colleague, Michele Schreyer, to present the White Paper adopted by the Commission this morning: "Reforming the Commission" . endTok	19.285930844745682
startTok As honourable Members will see from the document, which will be available to them today, the unprecedented consultations with the staff of the Commission, with this Parliament and with the Council, which have taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in January, have been very productive and resulted in useful refinements. endTok	51.044948845084114
startTok Together with Romano Prodi, I express my gratitude to this House and to the very large number of people who have put time and effort into giving us their constructive responses. endTok	44.39145301714706
startTok The White Paper puts reform in its proper political context. endTok	55.497309033354526
startTok In the Commission, systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred. endTok	61.35269738021503
startTok The treaties have been revised, new managerial tasks have been attributed by this Parliament and by the Council to the Commission, and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our Union, in our continent and in the world. endTok	39.004442373131894
startTok Those realities, together with the approach of further enlargements, all counsel strongly for modernisation of the Commission, so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development, of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness, maximum responsibility and maximum accountability. endTok	125.30322967586864
startTok The sustained independence and strength of the Commission are, of course, basic to that mission as this House has repeatedly recognised. endTok	74.65305362073333
startTok Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too. endTok	95.86615455995
startTok The Commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind, and that is clear to all of the institutions - it is well understood everywhere. endTok	41.57401799597833
startTok But the Commission does exist to serve the Union and its peoples with high standards of performance. endTok	71.96276238148262
startTok That is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the Commission want to provide and will provide. endTok	53.54455170585182
startTok The House will be aware, of course, that the Commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone. endTok	38.44100092308735
startTok All institutions in the European Union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly. endTok	25.274137195695157
startTok I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many Members of this House across the spectrum. endTok	24.33117944636993
startTok One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House. endTok	42.68133769357543
startTok Last month, as Romano Prodi has just said, we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the Commission and we will fully report on that in September. endTok	68.1859180832809
startTok Our aim is to focus the Commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in line with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years. endTok	61.5611138869689
startTok Inevitably, that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended. endTok	194.56990954945692
startTok It means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the Union. endTok	48.52877150239596
startTok It means allocating staff to areas of high-policy importance within departments and across the Commission. endTok	151.50728316795065
startTok And when that assessment is complete, we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us. endTok	66.76226458888866
startTok If they are proven not to be, we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority. endTok	60.38345601408889
startTok If that does not meet with a positive response, the difficult issue of which of our lower-priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed, not just by the Commission, but by this Parliament and by the Council too. endTok	52.15726329380635
startTok I do not make this point because of any desire in the Prodi Commission to retreat from activities or responsibilities. endTok	78.30290755798585
startTok On the contrary, as many in this House understand, I am setting out these considerations because we want to meet our responsibilities and meet them with full effectiveness and full accountability. endTok	75.00622898174225
startTok That means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources either by reducing activities or by increasing means or by a combination of both. endTok	112.77688694516678
startTok In each of the three pillars of reform, the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital. endTok	55.26318173867521
startTok The new activity-based management system, that the President just mentioned, will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time. endTok	60.749976825335665
startTok The role of the budgetary authority in the operation of ABM will, therefore, be vital. endTok	35.993436115990555
startTok Attempts to micro-manage the Commission' s operations are clearly in no one' s interest. endTok	86.19330960053284
startTok A resilient and practical interinstitutional agreement will, therefore, be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activity-based management. endTok	45.91508308734545
startTok In human resources policy, the involvement of Parliament will unavoidably have to be as an employer of civil servants as well as a democratic institution to which the Commission is accountable. endTok	47.3254419026856
startTok Again, that will be a very demanding challenge. endTok	54.775993843188
startTok And finally, in the crucial area of financial management where the Court of Auditors, the Committee of Independent Experts and other external and internal analyses have strongly advised radical change, the support of this House in implementing the recommendations for full security of money and value for money will be of prime importance. endTok	75.40924341125525
startTok In the limited time available for this statement, it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals. endTok	54.01716789059749
startTok I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years, and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon. endTok	25.799810955946107
startTok It is clear, of course, that in many ways the really hard work starts now, with the implementation of our proposals. endTok	53.2151844014629
startTok I look forward to working with this Parliament, with the Council and with the staff of the institutions to ensure that the reform strategy is put fully into effect for the benefit of the Union and for the advantage of all of its peoples. endTok	30.41290193961618
startTok Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock. endTok	11.76527624403846
startTok We shall now move on to Question Time. endTok	67.54395480636683
startTok Madam President, the Commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials. endTok	51.57314193673155
startTok Recently, the immunity of a former Commissioner was lifted and proceedings are currently pending before a judge in Brussels on the basis that Brussels is the seat of the Community institutions. endTok	55.27190478630452
startTok Yet these institutions have other seats and, given that the Community' s actions affect the whole Community territory, there are in fact thousands of courts which could judge officials, Commissioners and so on. endTok	97.4446175152499
startTok Is the Commission aware that, in order to lift immunity, it would be necessary to adopt a new legal instrument to regulate the procedure for holding Commission officials accountable, including former and current Commissioners? endTok	86.98141085494036
startTok There is effective legal precaution. endTok	65.23913885001919
startTok In the particular case that the honourable Member has in mind, not only did the Commission easily and quickly come to a decision to waive the immunity of a former Commissioner, but the former Commissioner herself advised the Commission of her desire that the immunity should be lifted. endTok	59.50657139285389
startTok I can see the complexities that concern the honourable Member, but I say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted, and every single one of those requests has been met, and met with alacrity. endTok	47.442232163777085
startTok I think that the House can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded, but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every Member State in seeking to get information, or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the Commission. endTok	65.22280896018701
startTok As the Parliament' s rapporteur on the staff elements of your report, Mr Kinnock, I very much welcome the fact that we are now starting the process, and if I may say to all colleagues here, we have a very important task to do, which will be absolutely central to the future of the Commission and its effectiveness. endTok	42.03104725371905
startTok And I make the point, before I move to my questions, that what happens concerning the Staff Regulations in the Commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because, of course, the European Parliament staff operate under the same conditions. endTok	89.96482274210528
startTok That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process. endTok	45.414932449541865
startTok Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock, if I may. endTok	65.89937439471096
startTok The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms. endTok	30.731243962847667
startTok Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation, and clearly that is a major concern. endTok	72.585124077496
startTok Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside. endTok	122.26210302473511
startTok And if we are to move forward, I suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side, early evidence of change of culture, empowerment and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later. endTok	79.81109371136287
startTok And if we look at the original proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations. endTok	54.159807149395256
startTok Indeed, it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced. endTok	51.67767762500242
startTok I suggest that is too long, and we really must move forward much more quickly than that. endTok	46.5932730168855
startTok The second point that I want to make concerns information technology. endTok	49.38786245670694
startTok Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about, because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms. endTok	120.35415067944602
startTok On the second part of Mr Harbour' s question, he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change, not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission, as the President briefly outlined in his statement. endTok	59.50120877001216
startTok Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale, the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials, which is already very strong, will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training, the allocation of responsibility, the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing. endTok	52.967860083267304
startTok Cultures are products of structures and systems, and the structures and systems have become old. endTok	172.13830689583034
startTok By renovating those structures and systems, in some cases very radically, we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before. endTok	84.73606770407234
startTok I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour. endTok	38.55120332676493
startTok I share his impatience to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices. endTok	86.1168561061421
startTok I wish I could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002, but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect. endTok	89.85258435627365
startTok I do not use those as an excuse. endTok	39.962196582993506
startTok We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms, these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously. endTok	67.07737383882059
startTok I would like everything to happen much more quickly. endTok	32.01635427490038
startTok It is better to do it absolutely properly. endTok	46.26486290519598
startTok Madam President, we admire Mr Kinnock' s vision and sense of realism. For he is holding up visions of a well-oiled and effective administration and is, at the same time, drawing our attention to the difficulties which will arise and which can already be anticipated. endTok	61.37279902646609
startTok Mr Prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities. endTok	26.44994320793994
startTok We will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first. endTok	67.82946379316982
startTok I think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities, because I can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise. endTok	58.484503725231605
startTok Enlargement - that is enlargement of the Union - is one of the key challenges in this context. endTok	46.52804398613143
startTok I would also like to point out that when it comes to keeping the peace, it will require a much greater effort to get a great many more people on board. endTok	29.660311733228944
startTok We must resolutely switch from our present, rather bureaucratic approach which we are all familiar with - it pervades our development cooperation for example - to a cooperation for peace. endTok	56.03487550032289
startTok Could Mr Kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the Council and Parliament to come up with for these priorities? endTok	88.86367574428428
startTok I am grateful to Mrs Maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this House. endTok	57.29590857131136
startTok Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out. endTok	59.618758042214516
startTok We are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities, not in order to evade any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have. endTok	63.377679921159505
startTok One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union. endTok	62.042139037242436
startTok One of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect. endTok	45.46693546582104
startTok Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism. endTok	64.61900287370955
startTok Since I was brought up to believe that the victory of ideals needs to be organised, I may be able to make an appeal to her to understand and support our mechanistic view of this because it is for the great and central purposes of the Union and its enlargement. endTok	47.64213486829594
startTok I hope that, in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the Council and with Parliament, not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way, but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the Union. endTok	54.41612203877406
startTok I do believe that reform with all it implies, including the new mechanisms, will very strongly facilitate changes of that kind. endTok	158.09463320473847
startTok I would like to take the opportunity firstly to congratulate the Commission on unanimously bringing forward this timely and substantial White Paper with the accompanying action plan and I think when the President of the Commission described his Vice-President as acting with intelligence, enthusiasm and energy that indeed that is a fair and valid description with regard to this procedure. endTok	45.72023589442313
startTok Two questions if I may. endTok	272.6146899969266
startTok We anticipate, if I understand correctly, a report in September on core activities. endTok	141.81962282112332
startTok Will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the Parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the Commission anticipates such a procedure? endTok	83.41603213842434
startTok Secondly, on the question of ex ante and ex post auditing and procedures, do I understand correctly - and I have not had the opportunity to wade into the detail of the paper - that the unanimous decision of the Commission is indeed to empower the Directorates-General to liberate them from the ex ante visae system but to put in their place a strong ex post and independent and centralised audit system? endTok	52.36002783614423
startTok If that is the case I can say at least that after prolonged and at times engaging discussion each way in my own Group, I believe that if we have demanded in this House as we have done that we have responsibility at each level in the Commission, its necessary counterpart is that we free people up to be managers. endTok	72.69014138863227
startTok Let the managers manage. endTok	451.80976748188374
startTok I want to thank Mr Cox and indeed his group for the way in which several Members have strongly engaged themselves and interested themselves in the detail of reform which can sometimes be rather trying but is always, as he indicated, worthwhile. endTok	78.92615199917458
startTok So far as the September communication is concerned, it is unprecedented. endTok	49.09301736362208
startTok It will not be just one of the screenings that the Commission has periodically undertaken but a very thorough and sharp review within Directorates-General and across the Commission for which we have established a mechanism for reviewing the demands on us and the means that we have to meet those demands. endTok	35.53098898400673
startTok It is conceivable therefore - I cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which Parliament is engaged we may have to - I emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to Parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision. endTok	68.14395596946083
startTok That is a sensible forecast to make, it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain. endTok	32.624095955749695
startTok Can I thank Mr Cox for underlining the virtue of following absolutely the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts and introducing a system which will end definitely with the revision of the financial regulation and the end of centralised ex ante control. endTok	40.6827378550874
startTok I would emphasise, too, that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to "responsibilise" - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means. endTok	34.8289900218171
startTok In undertaking such a development in our organisation I am certain that we can match or even advance upon the success and increase in job motivation which has come as a consequence of similar developments in several administrations, both in the public sector and in the private sector, in the last decade or so. endTok	66.24369572785889
startTok I think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks. endTok	48.45797909340103
startTok Financial control will be absolutely secured, both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes, and because we will introduce a completely professional, independent internal audit service. endTok	62.55262876410836
startTok As I said earlier, our ambition is total security for money and value for money. endTok	84.21768396092318
startTok We are also interested in value for the people who work for us. endTok	44.690781761755346
startTok The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that. endTok	66.27469027052769
startTok I am also grateful, at the risk of being repetitive, to Mrs Theato for the consistent attention that she has given to these matters and indeed the way in which, if she will allow me to say so, she played midwife to many of the changes which we are now contemplating. endTok	46.26859133159463
startTok I hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part parentage. endTok	48.94459265525893
startTok First of all, I am not sure if I got the interpretation properly, but I do not think it would be possible for someone as expert as Mrs Theato to talk about the abolition of independent financial control. endTok	33.3361085222151
startTok There is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current Financial Controller by the financial regulation. endTok	44.24935071514358
startTok However, because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control, and audit under the present terms, it is very difficult to think of this as an uncompromised role, no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it. endTok	84.97763104743568
startTok So, the changes that we seek to make - as I say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts - are not negative in any way at all. endTok	41.495588882233946
startTok Coherence, consistency and universally good standards in a decentralised system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures. endTok	98.9085183545308
startTok One is to ensure high quality training, another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system, another is the establishment of a central financial service, as honourable Members will see from the White Paper, to ensure that those standards are set and supervised, and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service. endTok	61.438504454283496
startTok  endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok I will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but I am certain that on examination Mrs Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper, there are very strong assurances. endTok	32.961975924326566
startTok There will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this House particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in Directorates-General. endTok	19.454443738981862
startTok If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control, the ex ante system can be used. endTok	41.08180994163108
startTok Naturally, there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage. endTok	68.80891092202046
startTok Account is taken of that too in the White Paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system, it most certainly can be used. endTok	84.39339816121839
startTok Lastly on transition, I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called "soft law" . endTok	149.0180472299612
startTok We have had this discussion before and she knows I make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what I suppose we could call "hard law" . endTok	96.15141299215581
startTok But, on this issue, I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council. endTok	47.717241401911295
startTok There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper. endTok	59.834635512564894
startTok In addition, however, and very importantly, because it is a transition period, there will be training, there will be advice, there will be support, there will be assurances. endTok	74.1021273131964
startTok The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition. endTok	58.52121530388435
startTok Two other points I must make, because this is an essential question central to reform. endTok	84.29257197485484
startTok The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia. endTok	78.59359734692956
startTok Irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline. endTok	70.46482165620651
startTok I completely reject that simply because of the standards of Commission officials, the responsibility of directors-general and the assurances that we have built into the system. endTok	58.848168317069835
startTok Inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring. endTok	45.94852742687298
startTok Lastly, the system we currently have - as the Committee of Independent Experts asserted very strongly - is now unsustainable. endTok	58.63928907353493
startTok Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction. endTok	30.785077829324216
startTok Change will have to come in any case, change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one Friday to the next Monday from one system to another. endTok	69.91569327618082
startTok In so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have, I am certain that we have installed, or that we will install on the basis of our proposals, a system that will provide the Union, its taxpayers and this House with complete security. endTok	54.16246723179725
startTok Madam President, great importance has been attached to the reform process, which deserves to be acknowledged, although this may be somewhat premature. endTok	61.537370573967756
startTok My question is this: there is a need for reform, due not least to the accession of new countries, and thus to the enlargement of the Union. endTok	41.68642328713829
startTok How can we - the Commission, Parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries - meet this challenge more effectively, taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries? endTok	46.074462894280444
startTok The delegations are actively engaged - as am I in my delegation for relations with the Czech Republic - but it is clear that there is often a pronounced schoolmasterish tone to our dealings with one another. endTok	64.32660642652688
startTok How can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and also the Commission, and the work they perform together, more effective? endTok	61.29073682252412
startTok I am grateful to the honourable Member for underlining the fact that, apart from its own inherent merits, reform will be made necessary by accession, the enlargements, and particularly the kind of enlargements that our Union will shortly be engaging in. endTok	50.694249538539104
startTok It is essential that we have that reform, both for the sake of the current Union, and certainly to facilitate accessions. endTok	39.689589512782085
startTok In the course of the coming years I will be continuing the practice I have already started, together with several of my Commission colleagues obviously, of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States. endTok	56.450481437381995
startTok We are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering. endTok	45.94955720677868
startTok I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current Member States and by the Union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the Commission and officials and administrators in the Member States have to deal with the realities, the complex realities of membership of the Union and the single market, it will be difficult to see the joins. endTok	35.719881395495044
startTok That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see. endTok	23.273219988064163
startTok All I can do now is to promise to strive for it. endTok	57.5365625495259
startTok Can I start by wishing the Commissioner a very happy St David' s Day. endTok	72.12656014002506
startTok Thank you for the presentation. endTok	29.279973157894826
startTok It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public. endTok	27.418089682120982
startTok That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time. endTok	65.58526421753331
startTok It has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays I am sure will be very welcome, but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork. Excessive paperwork. endTok	96.28960809100066
startTok Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control? endTok	79.98268616339226
startTok That is a clear complaint that we get. endTok	38.056501666850885
startTok That needs to be addressed. endTok	26.26627380293385
startTok The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee. endTok	46.3302752712947
startTok This, of course, is welcome, but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure. endTok	64.54069355998678
startTok Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee' s work? endTok	221.4975671348351
startTok Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, by your actions, not your words. endTok	59.888755465203594
startTok The mission of reconnecting with the European public is critical as Mrs Morgan says and that can only be done on the basis of action not words. endTok	44.13153921104125
startTok I say that with some deference in the European Parliament where there are so many experts in words, but we will try to lead by example. endTok	52.413384958179655
startTok As far as excessive paper is concerned, the dilemma is spelt out by Mrs Morgan. endTok	28.151287160803292
startTok We detest the excess of paper, but given the requirements that we have to check and re-check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control, sometimes the requirements of administration, which some call bureaucracy, are unavoidable. endTok	67.98534476920906
startTok In order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum, we are not just talking about it; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary-general, an additional deputy secretary-general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the Commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper, so much bureaucracy and I must say so much frustration, not only for the citizens and businesses of the Union but for the people who work for the Commission too. endTok	55.40106660886741
startTok We shall certainly strive in order to do that and I think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent. endTok	33.771389557694434
startTok One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform, the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe. endTok	47.41322803724824
startTok I know I can rely on everyone here. endTok	40.76936908449895
startTok That concludes Question Time. endTok	95.12773847518423
startTok I should like to thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock. endTok	12.82081745266181
startTok Statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy endTok	12.238969495747666
startTok The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy. endTok	6.020743991532708
startTok Please give a very warm welcome to Mr Javier Solana to whom I shall hand over without further delay. endTok	119.52789625753783
startTok Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again, here in the European Parliament. endTok	20.26220067136207
startTok Much has happened since the last time I was here to talk about foreign and security policy issues in our continent. endTok	37.519436096712006
startTok Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened. endTok	84.23198146552653
startTok This afternoon I should like to share with you some ideas, particularly on the Common Foreign and Security Policy. endTok	22.34202407637401
startTok The world has certainly moved on significantly in recent months and many events have occurred. However, I will wait for question time to give specific answers to any questions you may have for me. endTok	79.08102090705788
startTok In recent months, since the last time I appeared before you, important events have occurred in this House and also in the European Union. I would remind you of two of these events, one of which is very dear to you all as members of this Parliament, and particularly to the President. endTok	40.49048348511436
startTok These are the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the European Union. endTok	23.7702854190738
startTok The events in Kosovo and the Balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds. There are also important issues at stake in the Middle East in which the President of this House played a major role on her recent trip. endTok	42.027660298083845
startTok Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency. A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America. endTok	36.406907043703846
startTok Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end, in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative, Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles, on his recent visit to the region. endTok	28.413109296757064
startTok However, I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki. endTok	66.16619389634995
startTok I will speak of this briefly. If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time, I will be pleased to answer them. endTok	38.32596871677402
startTok The Helsinki Summit under the Finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago. endTok	41.00773118414974
startTok Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent. endTok	38.83292150311556
startTok These were essentially of three types which I will describe. endTok	119.76568906781924
startTok The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management. endTok	46.79401633543296
startTok The first is a political and security committee, the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union' s relations with third countries and other organisations. endTok	28.178536784070634
startTok This basically involves relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and relations between the European Union and those countries which, although geographically in Europe, are not part of the European Union, or at least not at the moment. endTok	25.10240282281293
startTok I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events. endTok	49.86541844808145
startTok Firstly, with regard to the decision-making bodies, the Political and Security Committee met for the first time this morning, 1 March 2000. This committee was established by the last General Affairs Council. endTok	40.069231272632386
startTok Therefore, two months after the Helsinki declaration and decision, a Political and Security Committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the European Union. endTok	39.41453793202579
startTok I was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch. endTok	41.83582232435383
startTok You can be satisfied with the progress made. endTok	40.754577661942726
startTok The fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months. endTok	36.255728308812415
startTok Secondly, the Military Committee, which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries, will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration. endTok	72.47977463125021
startTok This Military Committee, as you can imagine, will have various duties. endTok	139.53093102676502
startTok In the interim stage, its basic duty will be to advise the Council and myself and to take initial decisions on how to set up the final bodies which we will, of course, try to have in place by the end of this year or the beginning of next. endTok	50.2909301218671
startTok Thirdly, the Military Staff will represent senior military personnel from the fifteen countries. Together with myself, this staff will form the civil and military secretariat whose task will be to prepare, with the assistance of the Military Committee, any operation needing to be organised in due course in the context of crisis management within the European Union. endTok	69.24248585373806
startTok This crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the Military Committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces. endTok	56.8923328071187
startTok Mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics, not for military purposes, but with strictly humanitarian ends. endTok	147.2103177219464
startTok We are therefore working diligently in this respect. Madam President, if, a few months ago when I had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time, I had told you that I would be able to announce on 1 March 2000 that the first meeting of the Political Committee had been held today, that the Military Committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the Military Staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use, many of you would surely have thought that the High Representative was going mad. endTok	50.5103140063374
startTok We are not mad. What we have done is to work long and hard, with determination and, without a shadow of a doubt, with the support not only of yourselves but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries which you represent. endTok	61.9649137383662
startTok Few initiatives within the European Union can have been progressed with such determination, drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since Helsinki. endTok	75.16422944821157
startTok In less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the Commission. endTok	33.706112963276894
startTok I must thank Commissioner Patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time. endTok	34.188316230139776
startTok I will now move on to the second issue which I should like to discuss with you. We have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility. endTok	32.30601972311514
startTok Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis. I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace. endTok	47.11210632962963
startTok It will participate in crisis management in order to help where there is war or situations of conflict, to re-establish calm and to take the heat out of these situations and also to avoid them. As you may recall, it was in this respect that the Helsinki Summit intelligently agreed to form a force of 60 000 soldiers from all the Member States. endTok	42.07617590618597
startTok It will be possible for this force to be deployed at any given moment within 60 days, or two months, to prevent a crisis and for it to remain in action to prevent conflict for a period of one year. This is a major operation and an important objective but I can say that we are in a position to meet this challenge which the Heads of State and Government posed in Helsinki. endTok	50.48582530173626
startTok On Monday, just two days ago, in Sintra, a beautiful city very close to Lisbon, the Defence Ministers of the fifteen Member States met and took some important decisions towards implementing this Headline Goal defined in Helsinki. endTok	82.7994495499482
startTok The proposed timetable is tight but essential and will require great determination from all of us, including this House. endTok	94.72818332905256
startTok I will set this out in five points. endTok	96.34853437032356
startTok Firstly, before the next General Affairs Council which will take place this month, we shall be able to define precisely the detailed and specific meaning of the Headline Goal, bearing in mind the views that the military planners may consider appropriate. endTok	74.33141449707038
startTok To say that we will deploy 60 000 soldiers in a peacekeeping operation is not the same thing as organising an operation to achieve peace. endTok	46.39346830164427
startTok We must therefore have considered all possible scenarios so that we can do this job and do it well. endTok	33.50265914286758
startTok Before 24 March we will therefore have established this timetable so that the General Affairs Council can, on this date, do its job and do it well. endTok	91.74193208666475
startTok Secondly, we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries. endTok	35.74351337947614
startTok Thirdly, we must look at the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can provide. endTok	48.206920344603645
startTok We may not have enough between the fifteen countries which will have to make an additional effort to meet the proposed needs. endTok	49.096142614641714
startTok How can we do this? endTok	23.528959312498568
startTok This should be decided by a Conference of the fifteen countries to look at the gap between what we want and what we have and to see how to distribute what we need among the fifteen Member States. endTok	38.17070688901827
startTok Madam President, the timetable must ensure that, by December of this year during the French presidency, the process can be completed with a major conference of forces from all the countries to ensure that the needs and capacities match. We will then be able to say truthfully that we have a plan of what we must do between the end of the year 2000 and the year 2003 which is the date we have set for having this capacity available. endTok	58.077983560989736
startTok This is what we are doing and we are committed to this. endTok	15.08963153207876
startTok We have worked hard in recent months and weeks and will continue to do so for the rest of this year during the Portuguese presidency, which is clearly carrying out excellent work, and during the French presidency which will undoubtedly continue working with the same speed and skill as it has demonstrated on other occasions. endTok	40.117198164746334
startTok I would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four European Councils, those in Lisbon and Feira and two during the French presidency. endTok	36.92876066425152
startTok On these four occasions, the Heads of Government will also be ready to continue examining these issues so that we do not lose the momentum and so that, by the year 2003, we are able to deploy what we have agreed, if necessary. endTok	34.16690991657532
startTok Madam President, we are therefore working on this issue with determination, energy and the full support of all the governments and all the Heads of Government. endTok	41.277875822605836
startTok I have two further points to make on this process. endTok	41.81768275657843
startTok The European Union must carry out this whole operation in collaboration with the third countries to which I have referred which, although geographically in Europe, are not members of the European Union. endTok	31.632030386426152
startTok We have to work with these countries and involve them so that if such a crisis arises, which I hope will not be the case, all forces and all countries will be more than welcome. endTok	57.89974377631074
startTok Secondly, we have to be able to establish a smooth and transparent relationship with NATO. The operations to be carried out in the future will be of three types. endTok	35.72613289447497
startTok The first type will be operations in which European forces are involved within the framework of NATO. The second will be operations involving European forces and directed by them, but using the means and infrastructure of NATO. endTok	98.88295917231062
startTok The third will be operations in which the European forces act alone. In the first and second types we will need to cooperate with NATO and must therefore establish a transparent, positive and confident relationship between ourselves and NATO, as appropriate, which will be good for both the Alliance and ourselves. endTok	94.37345226434124
startTok Madam President, I have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide, the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months. endTok	22.22637697397615
startTok However, we must not forget that these crisis operations must be tackled from a civilian front as well. endTok	40.330347111183706
startTok As far as possible, we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in Kosovo and the Balkans. endTok	61.121053915534816
startTok We are working in this direction with the Commission and Commissioner Patten. endTok	19.99573344018895
startTok On Saturday morning I will meet with all the Ministers for Home Affairs of the fifteen Member States to try and make them see the need to mobilise a police force as well. endTok	40.237050184267844
startTok There are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that, after a few months, a police force is needed rather than a military force. Then, in the final moments of the crisis, it is perhaps courts or bodies to create democratic institutions which a country may need more than police. endTok	107.41984460842598
startTok In this respect we are also working closely and positively with the Commission. endTok	25.694478904743807
startTok I am not going to say much more on these issues. endTok	15.490722388502217
startTok Many other events have taken place in recent weeks which I should like to mention, such as in Kosovo, the Middle East and Chechnya. There are also many other issues which I should like to discuss with you. endTok	27.70270615875879
startTok However, I would prefer, Madam President, to stop at this point and allow questions to be asked so that I have time to answer them. endTok	47.794802291468244
startTok However, before this happens, I must tell you about a telephone conversation which I had a few hours ago with the Council of Europe representative on the subject of Chechnya. endTok	31.148564117425526
startTok Mr Gil-Robles returned this morning from Chechnya where he visited Grozny. When we spoke he gave me his initial impressions which are not good, as you can imagine. endTok	81.74915955258705
startTok The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating. endTok	29.642892503359512
startTok In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations. endTok	66.85484043581603
startTok In Grozny, there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat. endTok	34.56960094457799
startTok Yet there is one positive point which I must share with you. endTok	36.57310084854287
startTok Mr Gil-Robles told me that, when talking with the Acting President and the Foreign Affairs Minister last night, the Russian authorities had agreed to allow Council of Europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in Grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the Russian authorities. The latter were also in negotiation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow OSCE representatives to be involved as well, if feasible. endTok	44.252600193587156
startTok These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment. endTok	21.318039159763384
startTok I hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from Commissioner Gil-Robles and, in particular, better news from the Russian authorities. endTok	29.628739848074673
startTok Madam President, this brings me to the end of my speech. endTok	15.871963678854167
startTok I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning. endTok	12.77142452797017
startTok I am delighted to be participating in the work of this House and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the Commission. This work has one clear objective of allowing our European Union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations. endTok	34.87020162095971
startTok Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world. endTok	37.554724119698975
startTok Thank you very much indeed, Mr Solana. I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. endTok	7.99133203072873
startTok Thank you, Mr Poettering. endTok	16.676214794610527
startTok Mr Poettering, it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten' s participation in this debate is most opportune, and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes. endTok	31.92904941414235
startTok Commissioner, would you like to speak now or a little later? endTok	53.10286657504363
startTok (The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later) Very well, thank you. endTok	53.96342608473128
startTok Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Javier Solana, usted no es una persona loca, todo lo contrario (you are not mad, quite the opposite). endTok	22.70141426825461
startTok We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit. endTok	20.92660066158683
startTok We know that you have an important role in this. endTok	16.40662384592938
startTok I am also very pleased that you have mentioned Mozambique today, and in this context, and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question. endTok	30.27732129365297
startTok We cannot, of course, talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya. endTok	60.206293485619106
startTok My friend Jacques Poos will be talking about this on behalf of my Group. endTok	21.861895036729532
startTok I want to concentrate on Kosovo. endTok	27.211058083770332
startTok It is now quite clear that the situation in Kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means. endTok	25.92333177710943
startTok The KFOR forces have made, and are making, an invaluable contribution, but tanks and fire trenches cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term. endTok	62.53911840309342
startTok It has now reached the point where the Pentagon has prohibited American forces from returning to northern Mitrovica. endTok	58.24954995211255
startTok They have now been replaced by robust Danish, Finnish and Swedish troops. endTok	55.922952517035455
startTok It is easy to despair in the face of the violence and the hatred, but it is important for the sake of Kosovo, the Balkans and Europe that we do not fail. endTok	22.608904432285986
startTok Through the Stability Pact, we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation. endTok	87.68301245000475
startTok This is therefore a test of credibility for the Union' s common foreign and security policy. endTok	12.114728683431643
startTok At the moment, there is a huge shortage of suitable personnel in Kosovo. endTok	21.65381654272512
startTok Last autumn, we already heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for a civilian police force. endTok	51.76093546286329
startTok I am now delighted to hear that, this weekend, Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing. endTok	32.77362327530876
startTok I hope that this discussion will, in the first place, concentrate upon Kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied. endTok	29.9031980004318
startTok When it comes to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will comply with Parliament' s and, as I understand it, also the Commission' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo. endTok	30.707221126731824
startTok The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot, for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management, an idea which has already been translated into practical action. endTok	35.08466194503969
startTok Another, at least as important, lesson of our experience, however, is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently. endTok	66.06168660918028
startTok Therefore, the EU must also have an independent, credible conflict-prevention capacity. endTok	64.41915298437434
startTok On behalf of the Commission, Commissioner Patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction. endTok	18.898145346964714
startTok I am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military operations and to introduce headline goals for non-military operations, together with a Commission Crisis Centre. endTok	25.497215742731743
startTok My last question to Mr Solana is this: what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind? endTok	40.33222217806114
startTok How have these been organised by Mr Solana' s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the Commission? endTok	59.8378596450907
startTok Mr President, Mr Solana, you have the full support and confidence of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders. endTok	23.846575796111342
startTok I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian, peace-keeping and peace-making tasks. endTok	88.22954153218674
startTok But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe. endTok	37.73240936870989
startTok Such a split would only delight the despots and rogue States which threaten freedom and human rights. endTok	47.48162247967305
startTok I believe you heard the concerns which some members of the American Congress expressed last week here in Parliament. endTok	48.41680914014288
startTok You must lay these concerns to rest for, as you yourself have said, when we are able to present a united transatlantic front, we are in a position to do something. endTok	49.18390635937357
startTok When we are divided, we are weakened, and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged. endTok	25.49247455583658
startTok So, maintain as close contact as possible with our American allies and do not forget Norway, Turkey and Canada, either. endTok	124.03375913027516
startTok You also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers. endTok	47.83480466984317
startTok As George Robertson has said so often, we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into Kosovo. endTok	51.789944395131954
startTok It may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war. endTok	43.52697045286024
startTok Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats. endTok	62.013537906404274
startTok Everything else is wishful thinking. endTok	163.88898558761022
startTok That is why the Member States must either authorise more expenditure or rearrange their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment. We are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last Monday in Sintra. endTok	47.047710093377084
startTok The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny. endTok	37.912652698610266
startTok This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States. endTok	21.8643657979826
startTok No soldier can, of course, be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament. endTok	48.19171694064545
startTok It is therefore wrong for people to talk about a European army. endTok	28.259237973926094
startTok It will be a force comprised of various national units. endTok	59.435874685330106
startTok What is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment. endTok	79.85513768744156
startTok However, there is, of course, also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament. endTok	25.57479226383405
startTok As someone who both speaks and listens, we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. endTok	27.37860861598888
startTok Finally, I should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion. endTok	35.764304381106385
startTok Yesterday, a few of us met the Portuguese Defence Minister. endTok	73.73851014554785
startTok He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much. endTok	41.21588215781523
startTok Bear in mind that there are also non-aligned countries at the negotiating table. endTok	42.147712812286684
startTok We share your delight, as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is impaired. endTok	46.954286442267076
startTok There is one thing I shall again finally emphasise: that the purpose of all this is, of course, that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all. endTok	50.7486193570934
startTok That is the purpose of all this, and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with Mr Patten, for it is military, economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries. endTok	42.33702395175504
startTok Mr President, Mr Solana, we are all behaving like children. endTok	35.67177127383387
startTok You are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers. endTok	38.81665774293744
startTok It is extraordinary what decisions we took in Sintra concerning 2004, 2005, 2006. endTok	104.94617797474123
startTok But what about Kosovo in the year 2000? endTok	60.37271715193865
startTok You have spoken to Mr Gil-Robles. I have received an e-mail from a former colleague, Pierre Pradier, who is in Pristina at the moment. endTok	27.18622183351208
startTok He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina. endTok	25.90865699792657
startTok He treated Roma, Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo. endTok	55.31580444789393
startTok A man with three children and he was murdered. endTok	123.36117139166457
startTok We need policemen in Kosovo right now! endTok	43.796770820769396
startTok We need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice. endTok	25.399180055970394
startTok I am not a warmonger, but if we do not have soldiers to stop the criminals in Kosovo, then what is the point in having soldiers at all? endTok	29.581018332374235
startTok People may have to risk their lives in Kosovo, but that is the price of freedom at the moment. endTok	37.769869750683874
startTok If we allow what is happening today in Kosovo to continue - border provocation, Serbian provocation, Albanian provocation, etc. we are heading for war. endTok	48.49705648950245
startTok Tell me, what civilian forces are being mobilised, Mr Patten? endTok	68.53094431797824
startTok We need a civilian task force in Kosovo now to monitor what is happening, and to tell the military and the police what they must do, otherwise everything we did in Bosnia and everything we did in Kosovo will be negated by the reality of a country that is sinking deeper and deeper into violence. endTok	58.11020031361022
startTok (Interruption from the extreme right by Mr Martinez) We have a major problem, because we are providing travel warrants for the people, but we are incapable of acting when there is an enormous humanitarian crisis, as in Chechnya. endTok	41.69742701049068
startTok Mr Poettering is right - when he is right you have to tell him so. endTok	68.5724907725667
startTok He is not always right, but in this case he is. endTok	37.962011064354435
startTok I am in favour of a hardline policy against Austria, but we shall then have a responsibility towards Russia. endTok	29.49991827885243
startTok I do not like foreign ministers who say nothing - whether they are German and from my party, whether they are French from the broad left or whether they are Italians from any party! endTok	79.7415560180439
startTok In the current situation, we should say to the Russians "If you want money, if you want us to reduce your debts, you must allow a civilian peacekeeping force into Russia" . endTok	63.92021651809883
startTok If not, we are not prepared to pay for their war, since, by reducing the debt, by giving them money, we are paying their soldiers to carry out the massacres. endTok	44.95254235222093
startTok We are accomplices in the massacres in Chechnya if we continue to give money to the butchers. endTok	21.295509668405078
startTok It is not enough just to say, "You, the murderers, please stop the slaughter!" endTok	40.78415615173644
startTok They know full well that they should not commit these acts. endTok	61.89144396082689
startTok Do you think that Mr Putin does not know that what he is doing in Chechnya is not good? endTok	27.285234667819598
startTok But that is his strategy, he instigated this war. endTok	110.79743125142798
startTok From the beginning, he wanted this war in order to become president. endTok	77.18710537399545
startTok So that is the world as it is today. endTok	32.6850404857202
startTok For that reason I say to you: my Group is not entirely in agreement, but I am in favour of European defence. endTok	30.334843745651394
startTok I believe that European defence should be scrutinised by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments. endTok	13.114685259493399
startTok First of all, the European Parliament must give the green light to something and then the national parliaments will decide whether or not to send their soldiers. endTok	33.33772994296145
startTok If a civilian task force can, at the same time, intervene before and during a conflict and if we fail to take that step, we are behaving like children who like to play at sending in soldiers, but who are incapable of sending in civilians. endTok	83.8889503124367
startTok As long as we do not have a balance between the military and the civilian elements, we shall not be credible. endTok	29.886427043434107
startTok Mr President, Mr Solana, we are very uneasy about replying to you because, in our view, you are responsible for an area that does not really exist. endTok	27.10298189773226
startTok We believe that poor old Europe can only speak with one voice to say nothing or, and this is possibly more serious, that it can only resolve its diplomatic contradictions by simply tagging along with American politics. endTok	99.36582966086858
startTok In the lyrical mode of illusion and evasion that they are so fond of, at Sintra, the Fifteen decided to equip themselves with an action force that is 'pretentiously' called autonomous. endTok	57.76908117781454
startTok Now, the Union can certainly call the body an 'action force' even though for the moment it is only the mobilisation of a few funds and the mustering - on paper - of men, weapons and logistics. endTok	73.7671721427593
startTok But to believe that this muddle can be autonomous is another matter altogether. endTok	53.45550627277048
startTok What interests will this so-called force defend, in view of the fact that the countries of Europe do not have the same interests? endTok	45.20199633279844
startTok Let us just consider for a moment. endTok	77.33413670291422
startTok What is the basis of armed action? endTok	30.018990449638082
startTok It is the defence of a territory, the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital? endTok	76.56094435539285
startTok Just what is an army in the absence of a home country, in the absence of territory - because Europe is incapable of clearly defining its borders - and in the absence of clearly identified vital interests, which the Fifteen have, for good reason, never dared to discuss. endTok	82.99709433839388
startTok In short, what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy? endTok	85.23951248487032
startTok We fall back on a kind of ersatz army based on humanitarian rights, a kind of army in the service of vague ideas, of an ideal, the dangers of which have many times been shown in history. endTok	81.89941343916804
startTok A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one' s own interests. endTok	58.63324972389365
startTok But the CFSP will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system. endTok	79.32556250747811
startTok Who cannot see that in this case we are dealing with the twosome formed by London and Berlin, escorted by their respective henchmen, and who have no concept of their own diplomacy as being distinct from that of Washington, seeing themselves at best as bit-part players. endTok	61.76805880626017
startTok Mr Solana, you yourself are a perfect illustration of this, as it were, structural complicity, passing smoothly from NATO to the CFSP as if they were one and the same. Of course, in reality, they are the same thing. endTok	48.46135276933064
startTok It is still the old imperial service. endTok	48.02334149432862
startTok It is not without some amusement that we have seen you, in your pathetic rivalry with Mr Patten, present this delightful and most charming argument: one day you told a German newspaper, "I am the one that the Americans phone up" . endTok	63.176457303554706
startTok You might have added, Mr Solana, 'to give me their instructions' , because that is what we see, in fact. endTok	55.517662949641554
startTok In the case of the Balkans, just like everywhere else, one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it. endTok	41.4455588704932
startTok Yes, Jean-Claude Martinez was indeed right to interrupt you, Daniel Cohn-Bendit. In every case, it is follow-my-leader syndrome. endTok	84.99132807751741
startTok Do you think I am going over the top? endTok	59.999488240902345
startTok Every day the news brings more proof of our subservience. endTok	78.52579442147456
startTok Echelon is one of many examples of this, giving an image of Europe that is quite different to the one we like to envisage here. endTok	69.89166042090311
startTok The experts speak of a cultural problem, I think they might be right! endTok	115.41261904564702
startTok On behalf of the combined European right, I must say to you, Mr Solana, as High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, we do not have confidence in you. endTok	23.639607151610324
startTok You say that you are against war, but as Secretary-General of NATO you started a war. endTok	67.1557828421891
startTok A war of aggression, slavishly carrying out American military policy, in a sphere that was not that of the North Atlantic Treaty, against a state that had never been a member, that was not threatening any international borders and in violation of the rules of international law that establish the principle of non-interference as well as those governing the declaration of war. endTok	67.9264992746143
startTok Today, even Mr Cohn-Bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for. endTok	61.08119684434692
startTok We also have several questions to ask you that show our concern, that is the least one can say. endTok	64.4075428362095
startTok First of all, in your view, does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the Member States of the Union, as one might think, or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world? endTok	31.884965561617864
startTok Secondly, if you do recognise this right, then what standards of international law and political morality are you going to base your decisions on? endTok	114.71843729491657
startTok I can already hear your reply: humanitarian standards. endTok	101.43025446756504
startTok In Kosovo, it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in Serbia. endTok	60.08956280004853
startTok When the US killed 2 000 people in Panama, it was not to impose their politics, it was to combat drug trafficking. endTok	56.53757343382613
startTok When they landed in Somalia, before having to withdraw in disarray, it was not to guarantee their takeover of the oil route, it was to restore hope. endTok	72.94948864789981
startTok 'Restore hope' , do you remember? endTok	311.4061245800175
startTok In a nutshell, can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons. endTok	71.15337382201767
startTok Finally, you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management. endTok	66.44534045020755
startTok Not to make war, of course, but to protect peace. endTok	124.01956540520813
startTok But these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions. endTok	118.05612249157781
startTok Can you assure us that there will not be a preventative war against any State you care to mention, particularly those which, in their elections, do not ratify the policy adopted by the other Member States of the Union? endTok	47.803030311536524
startTok Mr Solana, these questions convey our concern. endTok	80.61361138397072
startTok You say that you are against war, but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that. endTok	41.78829122855313
startTok May God spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward. endTok	48.43674881216242
startTok Mr President, it goes without saying that the development of a European security and defence identity will have a huge impact on the three countries which joined NATO last year: Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. endTok	30.620244554452835
startTok As candidate countries of the European Union, they therefore wish to fully participate in this interesting initiative from the very beginning, that is to say as of now. endTok	58.279332953
startTok This request, however, was not honoured by the Council at its Helsinki Summit at the end of last year. In the Finnish capital only vague pledges were made regarding consultation and cooperation. endTok	59.489180093810724
startTok This is why I would like to ask the High Representative, Mr Solana, to what extent Prague, Warsaw and Budapest are, or will be, involved in European military crisis management plans. endTok	23.53853147729401
startTok Given Poland' s rather critical stance, this question is all the more pressing. endTok	93.64840932141509
startTok Its reservation is captured in the following, rather blunt wording: avoid American isolationism and European separatism. endTok	89.07532880401072
startTok As one might expect, the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Bronislaw Geremek, has expressed this concern in more diplomatic terms: "The development of a European defence identity should not be at the expense of NATO' s unity. endTok	41.81303694223837
startTok If anything, the European defence identity should serve to strengthen NATO" . endTok	49.70393279564243
startTok We all very much share this opinion. endTok	38.21804116206444
startTok Minister Geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new NATO Members from central and eastern Europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today. endTok	97.66813883944373
startTok The Czech Defence Minister, for example, shares this opinion. In the autumn of last year, the latter stated: "Security within Europe is not divisible. endTok	45.25269818095499
startTok It cannot be restricted to a small number of countries, with others only being allowed to observe or execute decisions" . endTok	64.97748299202121
startTok These opinions add substance to my question addressed to Mr Solana. endTok	99.5063197351783
startTok Poles only need five words for this: nothing about us without us! endTok	376.2615450543167
startTok What do the current EU Member States intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries? endTok	62.70224276631729
startTok Mr President, I too welcome the presence of the High Representative and his availability to answer Members' questions this time round. On his first appearance in November this was not possible, although this was not Mr Solana' s fault. endTok	55.03340102990174
startTok It should be acknowledged, however, that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by Members. endTok	60.393361644482255
startTok We should also acknowledge the efforts which Mr Solana is making towards achieving a more effective, visible and coherent Common Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union. endTok	30.07999493152121
startTok In this respect, I agree with the previous speakers about the need to have a comprehensive policy which includes not only military elements but also civilian, diplomatic, humanitarian and police elements, to which Mr Solana referred. endTok	49.48785072520241
startTok The Portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies. endTok	27.13065921886399
startTok In record time it has organised this Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this Common Foreign and Security Policy. endTok	38.07973660212475
startTok One of these milestones was the meeting in Sintra which I would like to ask Mr Solana about. endTok	22.60055088245503
startTok This meeting was based on two documents, one being a British document on the Headline Goals and the other a document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union. endTok	57.38756118132
startTok Mr Solana, would you be prepared, at your next appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to explain at length to the committee members the content of these documents discussed at the summit? I should like to ask Mr Patten and, through you, the President-in-Office to also attend and answer the same question. endTok	32.504748445946966
startTok Secondly, to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the French Defence Minister that the Member States had to allocate 0.7% of GDP to defence expenditure? endTok	37.83342669850686
startTok I would like to hear your opinion. Do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the Member States in this respect? endTok	35.34379486794017
startTok Thirdly, what assessment would you make of the 'Crisex 2000' exercises which have just ended in which, for the first time, the European Union took part in a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation? endTok	45.889638344682076
startTok Fourthly and finally, if the Member States asked for this, would you be prepared to chair the Political and Security Committee? In this way you could contribute all your experience as Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers, High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Secretary-General of the Western European Union and a former Secretary-General of NATO. endTok	28.212827612099534
startTok Mr Solana, as the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I shall limit my speech to those subjects. endTok	17.407500365360406
startTok You have, Mr Solana, heard the force of the criticisms made by the Members of Parliament who do not accept the appalling situations in Kosovo, Chechnya and elsewhere. endTok	34.58152922688248
startTok For my part, I do not wish to give up hope. endTok	40.8942991129891
startTok And today, as far as you are concerned, I acknowledge your efforts to build a European security and defence policy that is worthy of the name and which has not hitherto existed. endTok	33.65796255167109
startTok Indeed, we are still a long way from having achieved the desired objective, in any case, the objective that I wish to achieve. endTok	50.27007134052517
startTok But I do give you credit for your intense work, the number of meetings held, your efforts to create a rapid intervention force, your specific efforts to prevent crises, to manage them or stop them through civilian means and, if necessary, by military means. endTok	79.00695787882074
startTok I should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the "what is to be done" variety. endTok	23.768454958866997
startTok The first concerns the forthcoming European Councils in June and December, without counting the extraordinary Council meeting in Lisbon. endTok	85.27874428945191
startTok What are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings? endTok	43.91808619540757
startTok And finally, what do you most need at these next summits? endTok	97.84279935296894
startTok My second question is different, although it is not unconnected with the previous one. endTok	29.836775239849512
startTok It concerns the next IGC. endTok	47.49337461381496
startTok Do you not think that the agenda of the IGC should include the question of European security and defence policy in order to supplement the treaties, if it appeared that, as the texts of the treaties stand at the moment, they do not allow for a real defence policy to be established? endTok	32.06334875388398
startTok I believe that the Italian President of the Council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 February. endTok	25.235198219476604
startTok Can you tell us your position on this subject? endTok	16.053609937711606
startTok Mr President, Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe. endTok	44.32194052872955
startTok At long last, the European Union realises that it cannot afford to always give the Americans the political and military initiative. endTok	48.215230807449245
startTok The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent. endTok	52.49534989304263
startTok However, if Europe wants to take military action at crucial times, the Treaty must include a flexibility clause. endTok	81.95152629179651
startTok Mr Solana can play an important role in this. endTok	23.706257894020656
startTok He is not stupid. Certainly not! endTok	59.55769661732674
startTok He is a driven man, a competent man. endTok	89.09130062018905
startTok But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence. endTok	93.62675413050155
startTok In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU, as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit. endTok	29.34983035097873
startTok One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep, Mr President. endTok	49.59408319812723
startTok From a democratic point of view, I actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable. This is exacerbated by the fact that Mr Solana is, of course, not a democratically elected politician, but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament. endTok	48.831391521764196
startTok His position threatens to eclipse that of Commissioner Patten, as has been illustrated again today, in fact. endTok	76.13852209188374
startTok It appears that, as European security and defence policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold. endTok	40.43774117773838
startTok This too is unacceptable in my view. endTok	33.94697755777213
startTok Naturally, every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient, but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power. endTok	48.5977091579333
startTok Mr Solana must keep Europe awake without nodding off himself. endTok	130.24591835140873
startTok Mr President, peace is the European Union' s very raison d' être. I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly. endTok	23.615271641077737
startTok We have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy, cultural diversity and tolerance. endTok	92.92973428495388
startTok But look at us now! We are observing the misery in Chechnya in a position of powerlessness, and regard the wars in Africa with indifference, despite the fact that we have close ties with so many of these countries, given that they are ex-colonies. endTok	48.15848840820915
startTok Some of them are our ACP partners. endTok	54.404887875221455
startTok The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment. endTok	23.09799808300367
startTok In Kosovo, we stepped in with military means, having been unable to prevent the war in ex-Yugoslavia. endTok	119.11908543071361
startTok We are now unable to guide the peace. endTok	19.970544316734546
startTok This is why Europe is not credible as a Union. endTok	21.047770771707757
startTok I do not believe, Mr Solana, that we can restore this credibility by military means. endTok	30.65153559622591
startTok As representatives from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we all come from nations and regions which have never gone out to war with foreign countries, but we always needed to fight those who came to oppress us. endTok	54.00418772440832
startTok We are very sceptical about your current plans to form a military capability in the short term. This is not because we are against European defence, but European defence can and may only be the outcome of a sound, democratically-based decision process in respect of foreign affairs. endTok	64.24442380812017
startTok At the moment, Europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of. endTok	34.93546700223442
startTok I can hardly believe that we will ever achieve this at intergovernmental level. endTok	35.187264181260886
startTok In my opinion, it is far too easy to sit down with the military and gather up all the military equipment, which are such nice toys, after all. endTok	38.457281496400164
startTok I am very sceptical about the fact that Commissioner Patten cannot inform us in an equally credible way that he has drafted a prevention plan to stave off further degeneration, underdevelopment and conflicts in Europe and outside. endTok	30.828052583608308
startTok Because our borders do not stop at the Mediterranean Sea. endTok	55.80875153197137
startTok Mr President, allow me to start with the conquest of Kosovo. endTok	13.702613933517531
startTok It is obvious since the NATO bombing stopped eight months ago that the purpose of the bombing was not to stop ethnic cleansing, not to promote peace and order but to drive a wedge even further into Yugoslavia, to change the borders and to promote the New Order. endTok	70.06407303308836
startTok Today, we are turning a blind eye to the involvement of NATO occupation forces in the savage ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and non-Albanian speaking minorities. endTok	51.898792332742474
startTok All the signs point towards a second round of attacks on Yugoslavia and this is confirmed by the KLA attacks on Serbs in Mitrovica, the attempt to annex three towns in southern Serbia to Kosovo, the promotion of the independence of Kosovo, the fact that two thousand men have been channelled into Kosovo via Greece, despite the objections of the Greek people and, at the same time, intense efforts by NATO and the European Union to overturn the legitimate government of Yugoslavia. endTok	55.87313569997883
startTok On the other hand, despite his declarations on humanity and peace, it is clear from what Mr Solana has told us that, according to the Helsinki resolutions, we intend to set up a terrorist army, starting with 60 000 men, in order to strike at anyone who raises their head above the parapet. endTok	44.8601024502253
startTok Mr Solana has confirmed our view that, in a militarised European Union, NATO will have the upper hand. endTok	63.64548697580739
startTok That is why this job went to Mr Solana, the Secretary-General of NATO, who is also guilty of the crimes committed against Yugoslavia; the right man for the right job, against whom charges have been filed, calling for him to be tried as a war criminal. endTok	85.71819071601254
startTok Commissioner, Mr Solana, there is no doubt that you are acting quickly and forcefully and that you have made great progress in certain areas. endTok	25.767838629771287
startTok I wonder, and here I do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow Members, about the direction in which we are going. endTok	38.85280456955949
startTok I think that contrary to the great process of Economic and Monetary Union, which was an integrated process within the Community structures, today, unfortunately, the common foreign and security policy is entirely an intergovernmental procedure. endTok	45.230391854756036
startTok My first question, Mr Solana and Commissioner, is to establish whether, together, you have framed strategies that will, at least gradually, lead to the creation of a process that integrates the common foreign and security policy within the Community process. endTok	36.202269800686516
startTok We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union. endTok	17.49379016346009
startTok We can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be clear. endTok	44.980513063692314
startTok I also believe that we should not underestimate, and this is a question that I put to you, the stranglehold and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries. endTok	23.189418366148903
startTok We know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the Community. endTok	64.01046911685957
startTok Today, they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy, and I believe that they are working with that in mind. endTok	37.59165855635697
startTok Finally, with regard to Kosovo - Mr Cohn-Bendit was right to emphasise this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the status of Kosovo. endTok	31.82088463392992
startTok Without this status, there will only be instability, murders, provocation by Belgrade and it is a matter of urgency that the European Union should come to a decision on this matter. endTok	27.51162310974021
startTok Finally, I should like to thank Mr Poettering because I believe that the Belgian initiatives, as we say in common parlance, are getting a bit much. endTok	35.922828195992665
startTok I think many Member States among the fourteen other Member States would have many reasons not to cooperate in European Union meetings on justice, for example. endTok	54.70888245076225
startTok Four years after the arrest of Mr Dutroux and his associates, we have still not had a trial, and we still do not know what is happening. endTok	25.00348861864504
startTok As far as tourism is concerned, there will be many people in these fourteen Member States who could consider discouraging parents of young children from taking holidays in Belgium, for example. endTok	48.2141157658813
startTok So the time has come and I would ask Mr Solana and Mr Patten to tell Mr Michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may backfire on him, which is what I hope will happen. endTok	47.146501259637674
startTok Mr President, first of all, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Solana on this first day of March, for a number of frameworks have been put in place today which have a bearing on European security and defence policy. endTok	20.50301008293275
startTok But I do wonder what his own view is on this. endTok	34.70882477391158
startTok According to the documents, cooperation with the High Representative was fruitful. endTok	60.10884932068772
startTok You said yourself just now that you talked to them over lunch. You have to admit, it would be a rather odd if you were not on speaking terms with them and if there was a lack of cooperation between you and the new frameworks. endTok	64.76914263982378
startTok But do you not regret the fact that you do not preside over them yourself and are not their leading light? endTok	63.953325864470514
startTok I - and I believe many with me in Parliament - would like you to be the driving force behind them and would not want you to run the risk of being sidelined to some extent. endTok	55.175895394036424
startTok Over the past couple of months, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have, during discussions, among other things, with members of the NATO Assembly, tried to separate the defence policies of the EU and NATO. endTok	71.52617025387197
startTok One gets the impression in fact that they both think that the Petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the EU defence policy in due course. endTok	56.71243115680758
startTok The Treaties also point in that direction, although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a European pillar. endTok	96.65951499282262
startTok We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar. endTok	75.27552669279362
startTok Actually, I hear less and less about this. endTok	231.49574227947303
startTok I am under the impression that the European Union has pared its ambitions down to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr Patten taking responsibility for civil affairs, which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed, about which he has talked with enthusiasm, and rightly so, and Mr Solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment. endTok	50.823824484501756
startTok It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation, which would work very well. endTok	56.587092227143856
startTok But is there not more to it than that? endTok	171.87994286618147
startTok I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy, NATO' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence. endTok	54.97205527727389
startTok The European pillar does not really function any more as such. Europe is not venturing beyond the Petersberg tasks. endTok	57.491969600634626
startTok Is this actually how we want things done? endTok	113.9077867187265
startTok Moreover, whilst there may be talk of integrating the Western European Union into the European Union, there is no longer any mention of Article V, which is, of course, of direct concern to us. Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg. endTok	57.239655318652076
startTok Will it be omitted? endTok	47.45301287592072
startTok At the same time, an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets. endTok	24.105138224918218
startTok I think that this is to be welcomed, but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between Petersberg tasks and wider, collective defence tasks. endTok	54.03129766827246
startTok I wonder how this will develop. endTok	60.73763777608166
startTok I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future. endTok	60.54020707170013
startTok Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling? endTok	61.366185531001015
startTok I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy. endTok	27.97706023973824
startTok I do wonder, if Turkey were to bring in a brigade, would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy? endTok	70.37006553178786
startTok The fabric of Turkey' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities. endTok	122.24443966931132
startTok That would seem odd to me. endTok	46.44328087697892
startTok Secondly, the Baltic States are also knocking on our door. endTok	54.3248370896736
startTok Will they also take part in our defence policy? endTok	51.588452723027494
startTok It is a very interesting position to be in, to say the least. endTok	43.385556283717975
startTok High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force. endTok	60.01702872542052
startTok However, this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further. endTok	96.41765676561069
startTok I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who, rightly, are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference. endTok	27.155386440128524
startTok A word of warning to the latter: this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation. endTok	133.32316758499144
startTok We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy, and I would therefore ask you, in general terms, of course, whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues: the new, two-level Commission-High Representative structure; a clear, practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management. endTok	57.83010121022902
startTok At this stage, this could include, for example, collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee, the consolidation of Community responsibility for non-military crisis management, the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence, coordination of the Treaty on European Union, the NATO Charter and the WEU, the legal personality of the European Union, reinforced cooperation in this area as well, parliamentary control and, lastly, financing. endTok	40.48756817764123
startTok Do you think that any of these issues could be included, at least in the agenda of the current Conference? endTok	29.566838823871443
startTok Mr Solana, I am sitting quite close to you, close enough to see your face. endTok	77.2147145705926
startTok I think that you have aged, your face is quite lined. endTok	35.99450881996198
startTok It pains me to look at you and I despair on listening to you; that applies both to what you say about games with little soldiers, as Mrs Maes just put it, and what you do not say. endTok	76.66579146785269
startTok You bear a huge responsibility because the pretext of ethnic cleansing is being used to spill blood in another bout of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and yet you have stood up here, while blood is being spilled in Kosovo, and you have not said a word about it. endTok	51.722730209020845
startTok You are Spanish; you are from a large country, Mr Solana. endTok	130.8245380673582
startTok Spain and Franco were not one and the same. endTok	66.6600261344387
startTok Spain maintained its unity, it kept the Basque country and Andalucia and Catalonia and it did well to do so, because no one identified Spain with Franco and no one played around with Spain' s unity in the name of a Fascist dictator. endTok	87.18683466567435
startTok Today, you are identifying Yugoslavia with Milosevic and you are playing with Voivodina, with Montenegro and with southern Serbia. It is you who has created this mess. endTok	100.2216949520182
startTok Which is why, unless they are accompanied by clear political solutions which respect borders and autonomy and all the democratic guarantees, all these plans on paper will lead to new blood-letting in the Balkans. endTok	82.06359906384873
startTok Mr Solana, the war in Kosovo and the continuing crisis, have served to reveal a European public opinion that is aware that defending the fundamental values that gave rise to the European Union, throughout the world, should no longer continue to rest solely on the shoulders of the President of the United States of America and that the time has come to share the burden, which our American friends have constantly been demanding since Europe became a world economic power. endTok	40.318685191172555
startTok Over the last year, the Member States of the Union have, naturally, decided to implement specific measures designed to strengthen the operational capability of their armed forces and the informal summit in Sintra, held the day before yesterday in your presence, has just confirmed the main trends. endTok	50.49098933532104
startTok I have two questions on this subject to which your knowledge of the subjects concerned and the parties involved should make it possible to provide enlightening replies for our further debates and our work. endTok	43.49100604644797
startTok The first question concerns the training of this rapid intervention force of 60 000 men, which, as you have said, is likely to be deployed to perform peace-keeping and peace-building missions and be capable of maintaining them on a long-term basis, if necessary. endTok	46.27878536804557
startTok For the information of our colleagues, I must say here that the corresponding contingents should be divided into three parts: one third to prepare the mission, one third to carry it out and one third for rehabilitation, following often difficult ordeals for personnel and equipment. endTok	100.63347989385083
startTok This explains why the initial figures given in the press, setting the volume of the forces to be built up at around 200 000 men, is close to reality, which has certainly surprised the uninitiated. endTok	101.79694743853726
startTok My first question, Mr Solana, will be simple and more direct, perhaps, than those of my colleagues who have spoken before me. endTok	58.92715685486667
startTok You know the French proverb, 'Nothing for nothing' . endTok	200.87252016584966
startTok Do you really think that the governments of the Union are prepared to pay the corresponding price at a time when many of them, apparently at least, have decided to continue to reap what ten years ago were called the peace dividends. endTok	45.96112738414485
startTok My second question is of a more technical nature, but it is important for the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union to be transferred to the European Union as harmoniously as possible. endTok	18.477349479654137
startTok You have told us, in this regard, that three committees are being set up, a political committee and a security committee, which started up today, and a military committee. endTok	56.76887007369325
startTok You then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of the Western European Union but which are not members of the European Union. endTok	35.385699978806876
startTok In the operation of the temporary institutions, whose establishment has just been decided, can you tell us, Mr Solana, what status you intend to confer on the members of the Alliance and on the associate States of the WEU which, I repeat, are not yet members of the European Union? endTok	53.04070092282917
startTok Could they, for example, have a place, at least as observers, in the different political and security committees or in the military committee? endTok	101.92026657401208
startTok You know that they are concerned about the risk of being isolated and I should like to say that I understand their wish to participate with you in bringing this to a successful conclusion. endTok	33.6807603705455
startTok Mr President, Secretary-General, as you can tell, the Members of this House have listened with great interest to your information on the result of the Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers in Sintra and its significance in the European integration process in terms of security and defence. endTok	35.12138604878838
startTok Thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with Mr Gil-Robles. endTok	62.6612052049206
startTok However, in terms of foreign policy, I am not sure whether we can advance at the rate needed to meet requirements, as some Members have said this afternoon, without ignoring the problems which you are coming up against. endTok	40.571346146160835
startTok I will give you an example. endTok	38.073046028354426
startTok During the recent trip by the President of the European Parliament to the Middle East, which you mentioned, the various conflicting parties were in agreement about asking for a more active presence from the European Union in the on-going peace process in the region. endTok	35.97372979809216
startTok Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who, like us, hope to mediate between two opposing parties? endTok	85.59014765075825
startTok This House is rather doubtful about this and I am not sure whether you share this doubt. endTok	51.35619403615704
startTok In this respect, as you will know, the European Parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the Community. This is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the Member States but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination. endTok	54.287366784047165
startTok Could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative, without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the Foreign Affairs Committee? endTok	38.88449773714567
startTok Mr Solana, it has been said many times in this House that prevention is better than cure. endTok	20.597046185643176
startTok Of course it is, but there is no reason why Europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful. endTok	50.0051412870008
startTok In any case, it is prevention that I would like to discuss today. endTok	28.433093475904617
startTok War is threatening to break out again in the Gulf. endTok	109.69097805129262
startTok As you know, the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284, and this is likely to lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. endTok	70.30080843185796
startTok If this happens, the United States' Government and the British Government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention. endTok	36.86304077332581
startTok A visit to Iraq and meetings with the Iraqi leaders and leading figures, particularly Mr Tarek Aziz, convinced me that there is actually a possibility of persuading the Iraqi Government to cooperate in enforcing Resolution 1284. endTok	62.153059726555846
startTok However, the responsible authorities of the Western countries need to make it clear that, once the mission of the United Nations committee has been successfully completed, the embargo will be lifted and normal trade relations will be able to be resumed. endTok	53.528162650103916
startTok I would like to know what you and Europe are doing, Mr Solana, or what you intend to do in the near future, to stave off this threat of war. endTok	37.12619929234836
startTok Today, we have the chance to prevent it; tomorrow it may be too late. endTok	31.004832096114328
startTok I would also like to know whether, in this context, it would not be possible to do something to induce the Iraqi Government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the 615 missing Kuwaitis, or to set them free if this is within their power. endTok	40.07392219254502
startTok As we sit here, hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous peril from the floods in Mozambique. endTok	30.652091001320684
startTok This has not just happened. endTok	39.895567606902375
startTok The flooding has been going for weeks, and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need. endTok	79.43741527774324
startTok The level of practical assistance from the Community and from the Member States has been pathetic. endTok	30.813495710179488
startTok For a long time, many of us have sounded a warning that the European Union was spending too much time on its potentially damaging and essentially political project of establishing military decision-making structures, when instead it should have been concentrating its efforts on the improvement of its civil instruments, particularly for humanitarian intervention. endTok	108.33970853653635
startTok I acknowledge Mr Patten' s efforts in this direction, but what a pity that the governments of the Member States had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of NATO. endTok	61.302778994086786
startTok Of course, there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries. endTok	45.32445927200636
startTok These are of long standing, but are being addressed already within NATO. endTok	155.231653068834
startTok I have not yet heard a convincing security-policy explanation of why the European Union needs to establish autonomous, decision-making capabilities for the use of military forces outside of the NATO structures unless it is to create bodies which will rival NATO. endTok	60.02756120207934
startTok After all, the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit around the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council table. endTok	191.93693652736553
startTok NATO is largely European. endTok	493.96236759424914
startTok Finally, Mr Solana, I would just like to ask you what point there is in having the much heralded policy planning and early warning cell in the Council Secretariat if still we are taken by surprise by yet another humanitarian catastrophe. endTok	79.67595404764744
startTok Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, with regard to the war in Chechnya, we have all noted the particularly restrained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general and of the European Union in particular. endTok	31.13273506366654
startTok Now, what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya is similar to genocide. endTok	41.74222731191791
startTok How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants, the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns, villages and districts where, in amongst the whole of the civilian population, there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters? endTok	43.69091302437775
startTok How should we describe the sinister filtration camps, which are comparable to concentration camps, in which the population is suffering the most dreadful humiliation and from which able-bodied men between 15 and 65 years old rarely get out alive? endTok	71.5500145561105
startTok How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the deliberate fires, the deportations, which are called "cleansing" , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe? endTok	37.585573477588284
startTok And what can we say about the leaden shroud that is crashing down on Russian and international journalists and with the banishment of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres? endTok	48.219116411513994
startTok If that is realpolitik, if we really do not have any means, Mr Solana, as High Representative of the CFSP, and Commissioner, I put this question to you both, let us at least use the means that we do have, namely, the aid programmes to Russia. endTok	60.65578854493075
startTok The war in Chechnya proves, if proof were necessary, that the duty or the right to intervene stops at the borders of the great powers. endTok	89.49690505949349
startTok Let us therefore ensure that in future any euro spent in the Russian Federation is spent to alleviate the suffering of the people who are the victims of war, to the exclusion of any other objective. endTok	48.43520137529041
startTok Mr High Representative, you have spoken to us of the progress made to date in relation to the decisions taken at Helsinki. endTok	31.917876250976352
startTok Some of us here are passionately in favour of creating a distinctly European security organisation to defend peace in the world. endTok	31.30894761645945
startTok Of course we recognise the role of the Security Council, as the Helsinki resolutions clearly state, in maintaining international peace and security. endTok	71.02493452344092
startTok However, we note that you have said nothing to us about the fact that the role of the Security Council, as referred to at Helsinki, was contested recently. endTok	44.13221261002669
startTok The point is: does the political will exist to grant real administrative autonomy to this mechanism, which will cover the entire spectrum of Petersberg decisions? endTok	64.55386677576512
startTok What about the infrastructures? endTok	211.44638791608523
startTok Is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy? endTok	47.90175147994997
startTok Secondly, what will happen to the European defence industry which, after all, comes under the more general activities relating to this system? endTok	52.53137039399088
startTok Will current programmes continue to be implemented? endTok	94.6657339267031
startTok Finally, if the Treaty needs to be amended, how do you think this amendment will be implemented, following the report to be submitted in Feira? How will it be incorporated into the more general procedure for amending the institutional framework of the Treaty and how do you think this will fit in with the possibility of a system of qualified majority voting? endTok	48.79989758866241
startTok Has any thought been given to the matter? endTok	64.47800375866518
startTok Has it been discussed? endTok	111.98892713324275
startTok And to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant Commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the Commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient? endTok	138.98589109695865
startTok Mr President, I seem to recall from my study of European history, that the 1809 Convention of Sintra was a controversial peace agreement which probably lengthened rather than shortened the Napoleonic wars and nearly cost the Duke of Wellington his job. endTok	74.44275645879794
startTok I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra Agreement. endTok	24.34057308669412
startTok That said, I would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far. endTok	18.043793254494865
startTok But it has to be admitted that much of what he said is the progress in institutional matters, and the real test of the European defence identity will be in its ability to produce capability and capacity, rather than nicely formulated institutions. endTok	51.86785509291412
startTok And, to that end, I am not clear as to the extent to which we have progressed on developing heavy lift capacity to be able to get these 60 000 troops into operation, or what progress we have made on autonomous intelligence capacity, particularly given the American statements that they are not giving intelligence to Europeans until they can deal with security. endTok	72.63889530909984
startTok We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels. endTok	23.16070304768731
startTok To what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure, because some Member States spend considerably more than others. endTok	49.997845460591826
startTok And indeed, some Member States are not geared for mobility. endTok	33.16626582955005
startTok They are very static in their military forces, and unsuitable for this sort of warfare. endTok	32.24638158436834
startTok Can I perhaps also turn to Mr Patten as well and ask, in terms of the conflict prevention work we are going to be doing, to what extent will it be possible for us to look at long-term conflict-causing situations such as environmental degradation and shortage of water and then incorporate them into mainstream EU policies, particularly in development, because there is no point trying to rapidly respond to something we have had years to put right. endTok	57.06709039155671
startTok And finally, can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development. endTok	36.65374227359177
startTok We cannot leave it simply to governments. endTok	97.09980661585496
startTok I strongly support the decisions taken at Sintra. endTok	37.18411602217431
startTok They constitute a significant step towards establishing an effective European Security and Defence Policy. endTok	32.436235589524976
startTok The creation of the interim structures and the plans that are now being put into place to provide the military capacity for achieving EU policy objectives are positive steps in the right direction. endTok	42.47133444753666
startTok The recognition that the 60 000 strong military force will be involved in both peacemaking and peacekeeping is also appropriate. endTok	42.27650365100413
startTok However, while all these developments are indeed welcome, I would like to address a matter which I have raised in this House on previous occasions. endTok	49.62012681411561
startTok I am anxious to know how effective the EU' s policy planning and early warning unit has been. endTok	46.06710352674642
startTok While Commissioner Patten' s statement later this evening on the unfolding tragedy in Mozambique will be opportune, I would like to know if the policy planning and early warning unit provided advance information. endTok	50.52926056444776
startTok Would the High Representative be prepared to say to what extent this unit, which has been strongly supported by the committee of which I and Mr Titley are members, assisted in providing early information, analysis and an indication of the policy planning options open to yourselves? endTok	62.240342317931514
startTok I would also like to support Mr Titley' s comments on an effective role for the Parliament in this whole area. endTok	21.44423136399152
startTok If we are to realise our ambitions in the field of foreign policy, then effective anticipation and preparation for all sorts of crises, particularly humanitarian ones, are essential prerequisites. endTok	63.433219912562
startTok When Mr Solana last spoke to this Parliament I was highly critical of the fact that he hardly mentioned at all the idea of conflict prevention; and today we have him mentioning quite a lot about conflict prevention, but no proposal whatsoever about taking it on board on a serious way. endTok	71.77489583826812
startTok We have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year, but we currently have crises in Europe and on the borders of Europe and elsewhere which this Union is failing abjectly to deal with. endTok	43.527997851191614
startTok What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations. endTok	33.24907309266704
startTok We have not heard any information from Mr Solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya. endTok	30.647538438002613
startTok We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in Chechnya. endTok	69.14300994594214
startTok We have large gaps in what we are arguing for, in principle, in relation to human rights. endTok	28.941348886530342
startTok We mustered the capacity to intervene in relation to Kosovo, and we are now making a complete mess of Kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention. endTok	46.92826580470898
startTok So, I would ask Mr Solana to explain to this House the position of the European Union in relation to Chechnya. endTok	13.834339535697563
startTok What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end? endTok	51.36057767218453
startTok We have levers we can use with Russia if we choose to use them, but we are choosing not to use them. endTok	43.34039754795398
startTok Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, I have two questions for you, Mr Solana. How, with credibility, are you going to be able to continue promoting closer cooperation on defence and military issues if the Member States are not prepared to comply with common commitments? endTok	43.24977764171151
startTok Meetings are all very well, but it is the result that counts. endTok	40.6744359126789
startTok I also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper. endTok	44.334961199399075
startTok If we look around, the reality is that the CFSP is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk. Take, for example, Germany' s defence savings. endTok	71.23596994154556
startTok These are not only of concern to the defence minister, Mr Scharping. Instead, they also affect the whole of Europe. endTok	46.61502893299262
startTok In my own country, Sweden, the objective, and the commitment towards playing our part, is to supply 2 500 men for EU operations. endTok	69.92096094189031
startTok In the present situation, the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men, due to reduced defence spending. endTok	76.71128198875562
startTok If we translate this number into figures for the EU countries as a whole, which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place, we shall not have 60 000 men but, at best, 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003. endTok	53.97128771207317
startTok My second question concerns the following matter. Some weeks ago, you were evidently misquoted in the German-speaking media, whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters. endTok	104.51764286167686
startTok I should like, however, to know the background to this, namely whether, as High Representative, you have been toying at all with the idea of giving Austria special treatment in the context of your assignment and, if so, on whose mandate and with how much leeway. endTok	62.72721320106621
startTok I am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the High Representative. endTok	16.584145068185652
startTok I will not detain the Parliament for long but perhaps I could make one or two points and begin, which is sometimes rather dangerous in any Parliament, by drawing attention to the relationship between rhetoric and reality. endTok	80.09134082572648
startTok Mrs Pack did that in her remarks and anywhere that she is prepared to blaze a trail I think the rest of us should be courageous enough to follow. endTok	59.989103714942566
startTok I would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject. endTok	41.240760869178125
startTok I spoke last week at the extremely interesting session that was organised between members of the NATO parliamentary assembly and Members of this Parliament. endTok	51.25606018243533
startTok Many of you were there on that occasion and I think that it is fair to say that you could have cut the scepticism with a knife among many of the NATO parliamentary delegates when we spoke about Europe' s ambitions in the area of CFSP. endTok	42.89911900671713
startTok This was particularly true with some of the American delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well. endTok	48.78136686790269
startTok As I said in my remarks, I felt when I was speaking to some of them that they did not know whether to laugh or to cry and it is a reminder to all of us of the tests we have set ourselves and the tests which it is imperative that we meet over the coming months and years and in that context the High Representative' s remarks today were extremely encouraging. endTok	49.81241051719509
startTok  endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok We have come a remarkably long way in a remarkably short time, but there is still a very considerable distance to travel and over the next few months and years we are going to find ourselves, for example, facing up to difficult questions about resources. endTok	60.75229429724247
startTok Many people will argue that of course all that is required in Europe is for us to make better use of our existing resources but I suspect there will be a growing debate in our own countries in the Member States about whether that really is enough, about whether that is going to secure the sort of security policy which we wish to be more responsible for in our own Union. endTok	46.94323850002322
startTok I would just like to say a word about the non-military aspects of our security policy, of conflict prevention and crisis management. endTok	26.422273657658113
startTok Rightly, the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non-military side either and Mozambique reminds us of the importance of remembering that. endTok	78.74766351663024
startTok We will be bringing forward to the Council before Lisbon our proposals on a rapid reaction facility so that we can provide assistance where it is required, not in months or years, but in days or weeks. endTok	57.37844951905543
startTok We are establishing a Commission crisis centre as the operational interface with the situation centre in the high representative' s policy unit. endTok	107.41728355028441
startTok Additionally, and this is for me the most important area of all, an area where we are breaking new ground, we will, soon after we have put forward our proposals on a rapid reaction facility, be bringing forward proposals as well on non-military headline goals. endTok	51.91941090549267
startTok It is, I repeat, breaking new ground but it is very important that we do it for a number of reasons and policing in Kosovo, policing elsewhere, is the most dramatic and obvious example. endTok	43.04669561264604
startTok It is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner. endTok	25.3885546371779
startTok I grew up as a kid hoping I would be allowed to stay up on Saturday evenings in order to see a television programme about a community policeman called Dixon of Dock Green. endTok	59.89618079331222
startTok I have just been writing a report before I came to this job, and writing a very good report, just to respond to my honourable friend, on policing in part of my own country. endTok	47.18309237013843
startTok I remember talking about community policing to some American police experts and saying 'What in your view is the ideal community police officer' and the reply was 'a black grandmother' . endTok	89.75443714226651
startTok But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo. endTok	49.346302484442525
startTok We have armed forces, we have all got experience of training community police officers. endTok	94.71422685268837
startTok What is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing. endTok	44.606834485368495
startTok We need somebody who has the ability to detect crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well. endTok	106.25562826636707
startTok That is the sort of thing that we have to develop in the European Union and we have to face up to the fact that there are resource consequences. endTok	17.977107107814877
startTok So again, rhetoric and reality. endTok	90.53118611878594
startTok Now Mr Titley referred to conflict prevention in the broadest sense and asked what intellectual contribution we were going to make to this debate. endTok	53.08313219596928
startTok One thing I would advise him to do is to listen to Radio 4 at the end of March to the first Reith lecture where he will hear the Commissioner for External Relations giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on this whole subject. endTok	59.82214007410444
startTok But perhaps I could just say one or two things this afternoon. endTok	51.54517613264864
startTok I think there is an umbilical cord between neglecting human rights, between neglecting habeas corpus, between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance, between tyranny and between environmental degradation. endTok	60.895366338091826
startTok All those things come together. endTok	125.881858700128
startTok We talk about the complexities of our eco-system but there is an eco-system of values and political institutions which is just as important and absolutely crucial if we are going to make life better for people in countries like Mozambique and make life better for people rather closer to home in the Balkans as well. endTok	67.6003413974754
startTok So, in the coming months, we will be producing communications from the Commission, for example, which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises. endTok	53.045266285060706
startTok We will be producing a communication shortly on an issue which this Parliament feels passionately about, that is, how we can ensure that election observation is conducted as comprehensively and sensibly as possible without diminishing the integrity of the institutions which do it. endTok	50.448440940603334
startTok We will be producing a communication on anti-personnel landmines, actually the use of sensor equipment. endTok	40.73034183304894
startTok The work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in Mozambique. endTok	22.62853933743619
startTok They have managed to clear tracks from the villages to the wells, they have managed to clear tracks from villages to the primary schools. endTok	38.93878824585623
startTok What does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days, moving those anti-personnel mines around? endTok	87.67786990704083
startTok We are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise. endTok	47.26131745938317
startTok What we have to be looking at is the way an issue like that connects with our policies elsewhere. endTok	80.52663116658478
startTok We have to be looking at what we do with the stocks of anti-personnel landmines in Ukraine, in Moldova, the ecological consequences of dealing with those stocks, the financial consequences of dealing with those stocks, the political consequences of dealing with those stocks. endTok	32.10826868291665
startTok So the point I want to make is that all these things are intimately related. endTok	43.58140404180193
startTok We have all the instruments, we have all the instruments that we require but we have to pull them together much more effectively than we have in the past and that is the challenge which the High Representative and I face in the next four or five years. endTok	39.678188554254405
startTok Now, I hope that in facing those challenges we will have support which consists of adequate resources as well as spectacular rhetoric. endTok	56.698262607455106
startTok We all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and I will tell you three of them - Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo. endTok	23.998724630805864
startTok  endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok Those are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy and we will be tested on how successful a common foreign and security policy we develop above all by how we handle things in the Balkans and do not lose sight of the fact that there are quite a few of our critics, quite a few American politicians, quite a few senators and congressmen who say 'How can we possibly take you seriously in developing a common foreign and security policy when you cannot even handle problems on your own back doorstep?' . endTok	46.940832251548244
startTok So the big test for us is going to be in the Balkans. I hope that all those heads of government, all those prominent politicians in our Member States who promised the earth in the Balkans, who promised Marshall plans and who make all the other promises in the Balkans will be around when the budgetary authority decides how much we have got to spend in the Balkans. endTok	60.65610669803736
startTok I would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the European Council, the General Affairs Council and Ecofin. endTok	28.84003225995198
startTok All on the same political planet together and making sure that there is some harmony between what we promised the world and what we can actually deliver. endTok	68.27197075569909
startTok In the last few months in this job I have heard promises that we will do more in Latin America, I have heard promises that if there is a Middle East peace settlement, we will be there to pay for it. endTok	28.209108123667523
startTok I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses. endTok	19.681209060029648
startTok I have heard promises that we will secure democracy in Indonesia by giving more assistance to Indonesia endTok	49.179063612333124
startTok Where is the beef? endTok	79.96022561346138
startTok And that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy. endTok	54.28928239913819
startTok That is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view. endTok	27.148699261487415
startTok One reason why I am so passionately keen on carrying through an effective reform of our external assistance programmes is that I do not want to continue to be put in the situation where whenever one puts a question like that about the gulf between rhetoric and reality, the response is 'Oh but we know you are not running things efficiently, we know that you have not spent all your commitments, we know there is some money in your back pocket' . endTok	59.933178353614075
startTok I want us to be in a position in which we can say: 'It is not like that any more. We are running things as efficiently and competently as we can' . endTok	42.54296503589592
startTok So, Member States, we think that it is time that common foreign and security policy had a bridge between Council conclusions, between yards of communiqués and what we can actually deliver on the ground and I think that if we can achieve that the job of the High Representative will have been made a lot easier and the conditions of life for an awful lot of people around the world will have been made a lot better. endTok	36.65176732790758
startTok Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten. endTok	4.905951086083287
startTok I would also like to thank you for allowing us to sample your British sense of humour in the course of our dealings with this very difficult issue, for it makes things a little more interesting. endTok	32.31113449189551
startTok Women in the decision-making process endTok	12.60177648960468
startTok The next item is the declarations by the Council and the Commission on women in the decision-making process. endTok	8.614574652236831
startTok Mr President, two centuries ago, during the French Revolution, a very famous woman, Olympe de Gouges, was executed and proclaimed mad because she had supported equal rights for men and women. endTok	37.70193387440352
startTok Two centuries later, we have achieved a great deal in Europe. endTok	21.29765237365088
startTok The last century was marked by three periods. endTok	65.3196037631308
startTok The first period was a period of institutional change, change in the legislative framework and huge constitutional victories in all the Member States as a result of the fight by the women' s movement, as a result of major decisions by progressive parties and as the result of action by enlightened men and women. endTok	55.20995093236042
startTok This was followed by a second period, in which the worth of female models was recognised. endTok	47.43256215072391
startTok There were women everywhere. endTok	140.56528393784612
startTok Prime ministers, members of parliament, ministers, in the professional arena, doctors, lawyers, pilots, generals. endTok	57.38017323608525
startTok We are now in a third period: in this third period, the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed. endTok	41.08436642919443
startTok The composition, or rather the change in composition, will also bring about changes in policies - policies which need to take account of the merits and experience of both sexes. endTok	85.18746166854835
startTok Ladies and gentlemen, the first few months of the new millennium have been marked by two important events: the first was the election of the President of Finland, Mrs Halïnen. endTok	44.55017479254756
startTok For the first time in Finland, the women candidates outnumbered the men. endTok	48.643115056118525
startTok And a woman was elected. endTok	73.61333693329286
startTok The second event took place in France, which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in April 1999 at the 'Women and Men in Power' conference, at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio. endTok	47.82087014890696
startTok We must congratulate Prime Minister Jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner. endTok	35.81110488291361
startTok A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States. endTok	25.204304162818783
startTok But the figures tell the true story. endTok	92.53451330532577
startTok And the figures still give Europe cause for concern. endTok	157.08738970189384
startTok 24% of members of government are women and there are an average of 22% in parliament, although this fluctuates from 6% in some Member States to as many as 40% in others. endTok	101.63277015321286
startTok The number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small. endTok	79.28891818483093
startTok Even in countries such as Germany and Belgium, which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes, the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18%. endTok	62.81506246495801
startTok What we need, therefore, is to promote specific policies. endTok	62.16524168134861
startTok We need a policy mix which includes long-term political commitments, as in Sweden and Finland; they now have governments in which women account for 56% and 44% of members respectively. endTok	86.6820559152066
startTok We need organisation and statistical monitoring. endTok	104.1817281932859
startTok We need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture, mentality and specific problems of each area. endTok	105.82300767134716
startTok And, of course, these policies need a budget, they need to be given financial teeth. endTok	68.00424705467114
startTok Increasing the number of women or, as the French prime minister put it, increasing the influence of women in the decision-making centres, is the best way of renewing the policy, of reshaping the approach to the question, of injecting political thought with new ideas and new experience: the new ideas and experience which women can inject by reason of the different way in which they live and grow up. endTok	69.82077666030804
startTok The recent initiative by the Finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision-making centres is extremely important. endTok	27.540413734313084
startTok These indicators include national parliaments, regional councils and town councils and give a complete picture of the degree of representation of women in every Member State. endTok	53.52903048051543
startTok I think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets, compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool. endTok	60.10214275575663
startTok The programme which I shall present for the fifth women' s programme includes a similar initiative for systematic monitoring. endTok	115.88980358533418
startTok Although legislative measures and institutional intervention by Member States have been effective as far as the decision-making centres of the parties in power is concerned, the same cannot be said for the private sector. endTok	40.228609000721896
startTok My contacts with large European and multinational companies in Europe have brought tragic results to light. endTok	84.6602205055864
startTok There are companies at European level which employ thousands of workers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2% of the directors and managers are women. endTok	32.42503182657036
startTok Nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decision-making centres. endTok	32.57382538979948
startTok Here too, specific efforts will be made of course; naturally they cannot be of a legislative nature, but they can operate on the basis of an exchange of best practices; in all cases, my initial contact with the chairmen and directors of these large companies has had positive results. endTok	54.96563353632982
startTok As you know, Europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within. endTok	63.685893694534336
startTok A decision has already been taken on quotas of 40% for each sex on all teams and on all research and technological development programmes. endTok	74.36764707294398
startTok It was approved by the House in May 1999, when the need for women in research and technology was stressed. endTok	51.32734239724336
startTok We in the Commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the Commissioners are working together, as can be seen from the reform of the Commission, to achieve 40% representation of women on all the committees of the European Commission. endTok	49.410640526845
startTok Ladies and gentlemen, there are often objections, crypto-progressive objections, as to whether there should be a binding undertaking on the representation of women at the centres of power. endTok	31.844389289813655
startTok No one ever asks in a federal state if all the members of the federation should have their say. endTok	81.72511179050515
startTok And at the level of the European Union, the question of whether the 15 Member States need to be represented on every committee will never be asked. endTok	34.67503692107359
startTok Why then is it curious and why do we have reservations when it comes to a legislative commitment on the representation of half the population. endTok	37.16327934439292
startTok I should like to be absolutely categorical. endTok	12.01389286404453
startTok There should be no reservation, no reservation whatsoever about a legislative commitment on the representation of women at the centres of power. endTok	25.050878085596963
startTok (Applause) endTok	42.81948661699828
startTok Women make up half the population, half the strength of the planet. endTok	106.69276469902617
startTok Excluding women from the centres of power means, first, democratic failure and, secondly, under-exploitation of human resources. endTok	134.13523851140062
startTok We face a unique challenge and the time is ripe for combining economic and political expediency with respect for basic democratic principles. endTok	74.7697260183151
startTok I am optimistic that we shall succeed. endTok	23.566394814930174
startTok The bet before us is a bet with time. endTok	35.93151382088421
startTok Future generations of women must not be sidelined. endTok	32.301067488251434
startTok If need be, we must use all possible means to force the situation. endTok	112.40483286937611
startTok (Applause) endTok	42.81948661699828
startTok Mr President, firstly I must thank Mrs Belém Roseira for taking part in this debate and for her interesting speech on the subject. endTok	25.458776771752532
startTok I must also thank the Commissioner for being here and for her words. endTok	21.503446495674734
startTok The various political groups generally agree on the easily verifiable observation that women are under-represented in the decision-making process, in both the political and the economic and social spheres. endTok	31.56200071372768
startTok Nobody nowadays disputes that women should participate in political life, in the parties and in the institutions but it is not easy to agree on how this participation should be achieved. endTok	38.55408031824786
startTok The equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work. This involves both equality in accessing work, which implies equality in training, and equal pay for the same work, so often defended and yet far from being achieved. endTok	93.07705656536027
startTok We are convinced that the participation of women in the decision-making process will be beneficial to society as a whole. endTok	15.882169083490997
startTok Women always have a different viewpoint from men. This serves to enrich and complete the picture of the best solutions to the problems in daily life which people like us, who are dedicated to active politics, undertake to solve. endTok	87.3463748752067
startTok The difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making. endTok	62.12953249127624
startTok In some countries of the European Union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women. endTok	48.41603573404184
startTok However, this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men. endTok	70.32709462253717
startTok Women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent. endTok	47.39311084013175
startTok The real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women. endTok	36.22065912526779
startTok There must also be a clear and real will to allow more women, who are ready and able, to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision-making process. endTok	52.81274420698497
startTok There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system. endTok	31.270312130684896
startTok Some Members have even come out against this. endTok	80.48432758714375
startTok Personally, I would not want to feel like a quota, to think that I was in a particular job because I was a woman. endTok	46.70794461310411
startTok This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference. endTok	36.284956936835265
startTok Mr President, I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for good speeches on their part which I think provide hope for real optimism, especially given the will and commitment radiated by both women. endTok	34.1773791637712
startTok I think it was an excellent example the Commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the European Union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women. endTok	34.93683302830257
startTok It could hardly have been made more abundantly clear, what we are concerned with here. endTok	42.563661856564856
startTok I do hope that the Commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the Commission - but then, of course, she is young and full of energy. endTok	49.275856484815584
startTok I am convinced that it will be hard work, when all is said and done. endTok	52.636731430296116
startTok If the Commissioner asks for support from Parliament, she can in any case count upon the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. endTok	20.81546103687684
startTok We have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the Commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the Commissioner can implement her views on equality. endTok	45.33483440475183
startTok I would say to the Portuguese minister that I completely agree with her that what is at issue here is the fact that you cannot obtain equal rights without equal power. endTok	42.83106514410379
startTok That is absolutely crucial. endTok	20.144707693852524
startTok It should also be remembered, however, that no one voluntarily relinquishes power, and that applies to both men and women. endTok	22.889169973306526
startTok Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them, but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power, and I am thinking here, in particular, of positions of power in relation to children. endTok	40.32198249019991
startTok Moreover, I would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today. endTok	26.639914112002643
startTok Inevitably, we should like, for the same reasons of power politics, to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves. endTok	85.0459760663361
startTok What I want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides' surrendering power. endTok	21.63546070228866
startTok The Commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly-based political mix, and she specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden. endTok	70.20955367956095
startTok Just for the record, I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark. endTok	61.191537481027915
startTok And I say that, of course, because I come from Denmark. endTok	32.51578594347709
startTok In fact, 45% of the Danish government is made up of women, and that is, in reality, a touch more than in Finland. endTok	41.09452538648255
startTok We still do not have a female president but, on the other hand, we have a queen, and that must no doubt, in certain contexts, amount to the same thing. endTok	31.009689104612704
startTok I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned, notably the question of financial resources. endTok	31.168681292373698
startTok It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term. endTok	33.141682762767815
startTok In the short term, we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and, of course, also properly educated. endTok	29.914764249988465
startTok The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures. endTok	50.15201097585762
startTok One might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing, and I am therefore very happy that the Portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the Lisbon Summit, which is, of course, to be partly concerned with IT developments. endTok	47.091151330195416
startTok I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women, specifically because it is characterised by flat, rather than hierarchical, structures. endTok	52.36569569885023
startTok In Denmark, we have, in any case, seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up. endTok	67.55229705556664
startTok There are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which I should just like to mention here finally. endTok	34.47393638130406
startTok The first is the issue of the media' s influence. endTok	26.61488211074073
startTok I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish. endTok	27.222868117584284
startTok Do we have a special problem in this regard? endTok	22.559001518474375
startTok I have to say that I do not know the precise answer to that question. endTok	21.16240094132262
startTok I have a suspicion that this is the case, but I am not certain. endTok	21.45225469585338
startTok The second point is the enlargement of the Union. endTok	15.29253830474285
startTok I think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well, specifically that the new Member States should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned. endTok	26.41026942222628
startTok I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner' s statement; it is time that fine words were translated into action. endTok	14.656058393412968
startTok We all know to what extent women are under-represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves. endTok	33.50757990053996
startTok I agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems. endTok	62.34049874568722
startTok It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this. endTok	49.78975587292096
startTok Mainstreaming is a long-term commitment and process. endTok	70.01868470141301
startTok In the meantime, we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures. endTok	35.51834366162191
startTok We can learn from the successes mentioned, not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected, but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system. endTok	69.9150598494408
startTok I am pleased to say that in Wales, which I represent, 40% of our national assembly members are women as the result of positive action by the political parties but, on the other hand, we have only 4 women MPs from Wales in the House of Commons which is only 10% of the total; so statements of principle, of support in principle, are not enough because they have not worked. endTok	49.41005150962048
startTok If we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen. endTok	28.453559793100325
startTok Mr President, at the Second International Conference of Socialist Women held in Copenhagen in 1910, it was decided that the main demand of the time, that of a woman' s right to vote, should be linked to the women' s question as a whole and that (as also stated in the relevant resolution) Women' s Day must be accorded an international dimension and be thoroughly prepared for. endTok	61.48137969251459
startTok It is also worth noting that International Women' s Day has since been banned in all those countries in which fascism and racism came to power during and between the war years. endTok	56.17085549878186
startTok In 1910, a woman' s right to vote was on the agenda. endTok	42.59788440659937
startTok Today, we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision-making process. endTok	22.75022191087272
startTok Women are no homogenous collective. endTok	67.35651026147012
startTok Women belong to different social classes. endTok	99.13681577082505
startTok Women have different individual needs and interests. endTok	211.4337851048412
startTok Irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class, race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work, it is nonetheless a fact that, in all areas of society, the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men (albeit with a few individual exceptions, it is perhaps best to add). endTok	85.5049326560399
startTok In my own country, Sweden, a number of political parties have, in recent years, voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run. endTok	57.434291435396794
startTok This has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which, in turn, has provided opportunities for further research. endTok	32.27409384111736
startTok What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making? endTok	72.82555064415399
startTok What has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes, so too of course do the types of decisions made. endTok	82.11656035325129
startTok When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender, the word "qualifications" also crops up. endTok	154.15831281201412
startTok What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined. endTok	51.550768080033805
startTok It often looks as if men today, as in the past, always have the least defined qualifications. endTok	129.45677653927078
startTok Being a man therefore seems, in itself, to be synonymous with maximum competence. endTok	116.43267995213134
startTok This way of seeing things I consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today' s decision makers. endTok	37.946012535905126
startTok Earlier this year, we requested, here in this Chamber, that 8 March be made into an international holiday. endTok	90.61216350094809
startTok In anticipation of this request being met, I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the "Women' s World Marches" which are to begin this spring on International Women' s Day. endTok	70.17437656612326
startTok This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world. endTok	46.65718073252479
startTok Finally, I want to say, as Commissioner Patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close, that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother. endTok	41.623131297666134
startTok We do not have any such officers, but black grandmothers are in fact to be found. endTok	33.054847592711575
startTok Mr President, the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness. endTok	30.673489064690504
startTok Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics. endTok	51.71530708252088
startTok It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible. endTok	32.99483399635191
startTok In France, 95% of elected representatives are town councillors. endTok	66.00913291108279
startTok The vast majority of them are not members of any party. endTok	31.286196215376126
startTok In the authorities of the French departments, the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives, in right-wing or left-wing categories. endTok	83.95353737187523
startTok In order to be elected as a local councillor, you just have to want to be elected. endTok	46.59807222327447
startTok But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates. endTok	109.44061990831351
startTok Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union. endTok	19.46641887755591
startTok That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities. endTok	58.71242572332547
startTok The policy of minorities, while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family, to establish superficial divisions, is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system. endTok	44.23300144190508
startTok On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses. endTok	97.20839635573782
startTok The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women. endTok	56.67528680129556
startTok With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions. endTok	53.962551211754025
startTok It would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation. endTok	22.248146065703555
startTok The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs. endTok	44.67534517005428
startTok On the other hand, such a policy shows a deep contempt for women. endTok	33.40172769236978
startTok A woman must not attain political or administrative responsibilities automatically thanks to the implementation of the quota but by having her own merits and skills recognised. endTok	78.94308953122189
startTok Ladies, have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the sash of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota? endTok	51.18648784023514
startTok Women deserve more than a quota. endTok	68.16482003499146
startTok It is by reviving the principle of meritocracy that we shall improve in quantity and quality the presence of women in the decision-making process in quantity and quality. endTok	29.101869104103795
startTok Minister, Commissioner, everything you have just said has been very well expressed, even if a few male colleagues, if there are still any in the Chamber, perhaps gnashed their teeth. endTok	93.00159237285273
startTok I know that there are also some women who do not wish to hear of quotas or even of positive action, because they believe that this positive discrimination humiliates them and marks them forever in their careers. endTok	53.9403367651017
startTok But the statistics prove it: the positive action, even the quotas, - if they are not applied blindly, without distinction - have increased the number of women in the decision-making process. endTok	64.30814374021024
startTok That is why we are justified in stating that the use of quotas, as a transitional measure, contributes to balancing out the participation of men and women, particularly in political life. endTok	31.735444440370383
startTok I should like to take this opportunity to remind the Commissioner of some requests and initiatives of this Parliament which her predecessor did not follow up and which are closer to our hearts than the quotas. endTok	31.776147053858647
startTok First of all it concerns our report, which was adopted last year on the occasion of International Women' s Day in Strasbourg, which requests the Commission to submit to us a new proposal to amend the 1976 directive on the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of men and women. endTok	28.90317482513912
startTok According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, there was no longer any reason to maintain the positive action as a tolerated departure from the principle of equal treatment which only recognises an individual right, and not a right that belongs to the society that wishes to achieve this equality democratically. endTok	44.531675825669346
startTok Things being what they are, nobody should dare any longer to dispute that the right of equality of men and women is a fundamental right of a democratic society, requiring equal treatment and equal opportunity be achieved by a package of active measures, including positive action. endTok	83.41734475225427
startTok Therefore, Commissioner, you can go ahead. endTok	96.71341021446464
startTok You do not need to wait for a new amendment to the Treaty. endTok	22.11916369639714
startTok May I just remind you once again of our request for an amendment to the 1976 directive which has been watered down and misapplied with regard to the equal treatment of self-employed people, including assistant spouses. endTok	31.653697461974204
startTok No action has been taken on our report which unanimously proposed a European framework status for assistant spouses. endTok	98.67425334578651
startTok Here again, Commissioner, the ball is in your court. endTok	85.83115802423147
startTok Do not take too long to send it back. endTok	77.08239069717145
startTok I would like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their speeches and for committing themselves before the European Parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today. endTok	19.787000218743447
startTok The presence of women in decision-making bodies, in particular, is a question of democracy. endTok	23.219508950940302
startTok All citizens, both men and women, should be able to see, to feel that they are genuinely represented by those they have elected and those who rule. endTok	52.786283422140734
startTok If we consider the fact that more than half the population is made up of women but that that there are many more men than women present in these decision-making bodies, it is clear that we are still far from true democracy. endTok	50.708489377336875
startTok However, it is also a question of political agendas. endTok	22.2173860824149
startTok In addition to making up the majority of the population, women are also the most dynamic element in society: it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in Europe in recent years; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men, and in many of our regions, they are the main feature of the innovation, training, performance and flexibility development model. endTok	59.57800559499185
startTok Out of a sample of women who work in and around Milan, where I live, 90% said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day. endTok	71.54343014191276
startTok Women work an average of 60 hours a week, which is 20 hours longer than men. endTok	144.3050627664434
startTok The price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time. endTok	90.7442145589338
startTok If this is true, and it is, any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point. endTok	56.85707684383825
startTok Laws, programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well-constructed, coordinated and audacious, in order to encourage the formation of new cultural, economic, social, institutional and political ruling classes whose modernity is characterised by the involvement of women. endTok	48.85264336245708
startTok Much has been achieved on many issues in Europe, but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation. endTok	52.265998481090065
startTok I agree with the Commissioner that it is time for the European political sphere - the entire European political sphere - to represent women and men on an equal footing, and for decisive action to be taken in this matter. endTok	30.002369144318696
startTok Mr President, before I came here for today' s sitting, I was watching Finnish television. endTok	42.623759917938614
startTok In Finland, an honorary company of the Finnish army was saluting the new President of the Republic, with the words "Good morning, Madam President." endTok	85.38852656399702
startTok You perhaps know that, in Finland, the president is not just the leading public figure or political leader, but she is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces, so this was quite an interesting and historic occasion. endTok	87.33371419372439
startTok During the Finnish presidential term, a report was produced that reveals an image of the whole decision-making process, and, on the basis of this report, I hope that the Commissioner proposes legally binding ways of improving the position of women in decision making. endTok	37.921864640900196
startTok I urge you all, women of the Right, to listen to Mrs Lulling, because she told us why quotas were needed and, if any of us has sufficient experience of political life, it is she. endTok	67.12703290734876
startTok Finally, I would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference. endTok	11.290653157831356
startTok I appeal to you, ladies and gentlemen, not to vote in favour of the proposal tomorrow to moderate the contents of point 4, to prevent gender democracy from being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference. endTok	45.685138689134185
startTok Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, despite the progress made in terms of legislation and despite the complaints that we all utter from time to time on the subject of sexual inequality and sexual discrimination, the causes of these practices are still present in the amendments that have been tabled to this resolution. This means that we need to amend policies in various areas if we are to guarantee that women can participate on equal terms in the decision-making process. endTok	37.74431309612128
startTok We know that this area is proving more difficult to resolve, both because women still bear the main responsibilities in family life and because there is still prejudice and personal interest standing in the way of genuine participation by women in various areas which involve greater responsibility. endTok	84.8274329161111
startTok The truth is that the scant participation of women in centres of political representation and decision making demonstrates a democratic deficit which is incompatible with genuine democracy. endTok	46.20032495241617
startTok It is therefore essential for the various directives on equality to be complied with and for the Council, the Commission and each Member State strictly to respect the commitments they have made, particularly at the Beijing Conference. endTok	37.75019886533624
startTok Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am a right-wing Member of Parliament but I have the same battles as my colleagues in supporting and assisting fellow citizens in my country to gain power and access to decision-making posts, which should be feasible not only in the political arena but clearly also in all sectors of society. endTok	33.884237440808015
startTok Quite simply, I would say that there are several ways in which to attain positions of power and I am particularly against the system of quotas, because I believe it is especially contemptuous of women and I come from a country where parity has just been achieved. endTok	30.459997362080106
startTok It is quite logical, it is consistent! endTok	41.609418965009475
startTok It should have existed for a long time because women represent more than half of society and it seems quite clear to me that it is natural for them to represent at least 50%, if not more, of those within decision-making bodies and, inter alia, in the political arena. endTok	51.97529298494462
startTok So, there should be no positive discrimination to include women. endTok	69.17183169320771
startTok Woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense. endTok	108.93382473373345
startTok When I see that we are asking for training for women in politics, I want to say - no, definitely not. endTok	37.80481645303182
startTok Let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics - but why especially compel women to undergo training? endTok	97.9951066536787
startTok That simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority. endTok	36.19070571444418
startTok But I do know that we have never felt inferior to men, particularly in politics. endTok	48.70256495015012
startTok So I believe that we are conducting this battle to assist our fellow countrywomen to achieve decision-making power, to gain responsible posts in the political arena, but I believe that it will only be achieved if we completely change the way people think. endTok	48.41184570383182
startTok We shall all have to be sufficiently strong to force our political leaders to voluntarily impose women' s participation in the political decision-making process. endTok	32.19290885113745
startTok Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, "Women are half of heaven" , a successful man once said. endTok	93.67386615438758
startTok But when it comes to important decisions and priorities, there is a lack of women' s voices. endTok	30.318148752138704
startTok Women, who constitute more than half of the population, are heavily under-represented within political, economic and social fields. endTok	50.02247910497888
startTok That is unacceptable in a democracy. endTok	36.78232473326886
startTok Where equality is concerned, the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making. endTok	48.02826509915066
startTok If we are to achieve a balance, a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required. endTok	38.87334657999632
startTok An important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women' s full participation in power structures and decision making. endTok	41.27205011754542
startTok I am therefore delighted that the Commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind. endTok	13.518104943303848
startTok I propose that the EU' s objectives for women in the area of decision making should be based upon the averaged-out achievements of the three most successful Member States within each area, with the Member States each submitting a report annually which will then have to be evaluated. endTok	30.425934779857677
startTok Women are the foremost victims of human rights abuses such as rape, sexual offences, domestic violence and the trade in women, but they are under-represented on the legal and legislative bodies which pronounce upon these crimes. endTok	70.19261558987893
startTok The latter are consequently accorded low priority, and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted. endTok	102.24874331055707
startTok Women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under-represented in peace-keeping efforts, conflict resolution and reconstruction work. endTok	185.3154021435778
startTok In the resolution, we therefore urge the Member States to increase the proportion of women involved in all aspects of conflict resolution and peace-keeping. endTok	47.40120189978753
startTok The call for women' s participation in decision making on an equal footing with men is not only a demand for social justice and democracy; it is also essential if women' s experience and knowledge are to be utilised to the full. endTok	34.71571044709055
startTok Not to use women' s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste. endTok	47.37465121950733
startTok Women should not only be "half of heaven" but should also be entitled to take their share of responsibility for decisions which affect our entire planet. endTok	45.987061294591626
startTok Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today. endTok	10.766470379172093
startTok We have high hopes for what you will achieve. endTok	73.82664173102667
startTok We are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to occupy decision-making positions. endTok	45.15935033659698
startTok We want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large, we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women, and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today. endTok	47.20855646336205
startTok Furthermore, we want values that women consider important, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security and environmental protection, to be the guiding spirit for life in the European Union and, if possible, throughout the world. endTok	87.66353091293188
startTok In order to achieve this, women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has, until now, been essentially imbued with masculine values. endTok	39.89705148224576
startTok We know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for. endTok	89.45359995832592
startTok Let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory: not over men, not over anyone, but the victory of equality between men and women. endTok	58.661774342564414
startTok We therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities, and the great challenge confronting all Europeans now, and particularly women, concerns the new economy and the new information technologies. endTok	79.2190421816294
startTok The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women. endTok	25.036398729440016
startTok The rate of employment in Europe, which is much lower than in the United States and Japan, must be increased. endTok	23.916643888433327
startTok We must therefore have many more women in work, and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a shortfall. endTok	42.340506501898055
startTok I would therefore like to ask the Council and the Commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming Lisbon Summit to ensure that the new economy and the new Europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women. endTok	26.171601271434042
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, the reason why I was so pleased with your intervention was that you had the courage to list the Member States where the political representation of women is a success, such as, for example, in Finland, France and Sweden, and equally, you had the courage to list the Member States where things in this respect are not going so well, such as, for example, my own country and Greece too, which you forgot to mention. endTok	36.00691159900188
startTok Moreover, I have heard that for the next elections, it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in Greece. endTok	39.70275436078976
startTok I think this is a very sad state of affairs. endTok	21.069591083044745
startTok I appreciate your courage because I think that it is high time that we in the European institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda. endTok	53.53725004263127
startTok This is why I think it is important that this Parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution. endTok	19.249896863369706
startTok I myself, Commissioner, am a product of quotas. I do not believe that any of the MEPs will be able to prove that I am any less competent as a result. endTok	30.91180893425189
startTok It appears that the meritocracy in a number of our European countries is still so biased in favour of males that women simply do not stand a chance. endTok	32.7054248046913
startTok It is true that a number of countries in the European Union have already introduced quotas, and you yourself made reference to Belgium, Commissioner, where it has not really taken off. endTok	41.56514768602905
startTok Hardly surprising, would you not agree, Mrs Avilés Perea, not because we failed to find the necessary candidates, but because recent scientific research, instigated by the Commission, has shown that quotas are, in fact, only useful if women are placed in the appropriate safe seats. endTok	60.88279453989293
startTok This is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas. endTok	36.305656049436195
startTok Indeed, Minister, we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract. endTok	51.51124418319691
startTok But we should draw the necessary conclusions from this. endTok	49.662734393156605
startTok The electoral system which corresponds most closely to this model is the one-for-one system, as is being applied in Sweden on a voluntary basis. endTok	95.81739168071502
startTok I would suggest the following: where possible, apply it on a voluntary basis, where there is reluctance, impose it. endTok	94.01390775209144
startTok I hope that in the fifth action programme, Minister and Commissioner, benchmarking will enable the best practices of those countries to be carried through, for it is time that our groups gained an understanding of this. endTok	61.516247020739875
startTok Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council for their solid recommendations and, above all, for their proposals. endTok	15.285831089578759
startTok Because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women' s rights, I thought I might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, to today' s debate. endTok	60.386076240813864
startTok In an article entitled "If women ruled the world" , he maintains that if women were more involved in politics, the world would certainly not be so wedded to violence. endTok	94.81522055148925
startTok Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, may have been a female model in Ancient Greece, but the influence exercised by women today can act as a catalyst to stop militarisation and promote peace. endTok	69.92802957257703
startTok There are, therefore, serious grounds, over and above justice between the sexes, for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and evenly between men and women. endTok	66.08474912204849
startTok Women devote their entire lives to the endeavour to protect life and the environment through dialogue, reconciliation, an understanding of different views and resolving differences by peaceful means. endTok	159.58535290290902
startTok These female virtues can offer an alternative to today' s culture of violence and institute a new political culture and a fairer and more prosperous society for everyone. endTok	62.496131337057776
startTok That is why the Intergovernmental Conference must introduce into the Treaty the principle of balanced representation of women and men in all the institutions of the European Union and in all democratic institutions and political decision-making centres throughout the Community. endTok	28.40028860464679
startTok Mr President, why do women need their rightful share in political decision making? endTok	58.418475338173444
startTok And how should we achieve this? endTok	35.731022431224446
startTok We all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary. endTok	14.02773931460172
startTok It is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and, as such, a condition for political legitimacy. endTok	47.97023302461731
startTok But if we look into how to achieve this, the opinions are greatly divided. endTok	66.3223952040156
startTok Is it sufficient to provide information and training and to create practical conditions or should we give preferential treatment, much like the quota system for the electoral lists of the political parties? endTok	61.826374408844515
startTok And is it then up to the state, in other words the legislative, to impose such measures on political parties? endTok	87.24688808233098
startTok Or should we even consider a system in which 50% of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies? endTok	89.18544805480656
startTok This discussion, which is being held in some parts of Europe and here too under the French banner of parité, touches the very core of democracy, and is also about the political significance which we are prepared to accord to being a woman. endTok	40.7493698711128
startTok In my opinion, the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level. endTok	37.272191373135115
startTok I am a great fan of voluntary quotas on electoral lists, without which, in fact, I would not be here today. endTok	43.68960053669113
startTok Like Mrs Van Lancker, I am a product of such a measure. endTok	32.607307163589546
startTok In my opinion, though, the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties, at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself. endTok	45.34715795958464
startTok In other words, the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid. endTok	71.90853157108685
startTok We would, in this way, violate democracy. endTok	60.158570011710914
startTok Mr President, today' s debate is devoted to the subject of the composition of decision-making bodies and changes to the decision-making system in Europe. endTok	18.723452958794688
startTok We have entered a new period in which there is a fairly full institutional framework and in which women are well represented in all sectors, education, work, culture. endTok	69.54028090718491
startTok The problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decision-making centres. endTok	18.458059746112358
startTok The debate is a deeply political one. endTok	59.87239443403719
startTok There are two approaches. endTok	19.791463560763564
startTok The first is a policy of persuasion. endTok	15.339512772517322
startTok Gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved. endTok	84.7306535660789
startTok Three comments: the first is based on the fact that women are able. I can, therefore all women can. endTok	77.54864511821667
startTok How do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded? endTok	29.53500026555414
startTok We are able but the rest of the female population is not? endTok	44.29082056419581
startTok Here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics. Because women have to deal with different realities. endTok	45.72227434340199
startTok Because they have fewer opportunities. endTok	57.83481682001129
startTok Because they have a different level of education. endTok	62.6175967675035
startTok Because they have to face social obstacles. Because they never have time to deal with matters of public interest. endTok	55.70700147562645
startTok The second comment is that we need to persuade the political leaders. endTok	19.481731429184673
startTok Not necessary! endTok	492.70360172095866
startTok They have all been persuaded! endTok	23.619489126949198
startTok There is not one male politician who does not agree to the involvement of women. endTok	16.87080159816031
startTok There is not one party, from the far left to the far right, which does not stress the need for women to take part. endTok	53.6451145675413
startTok On paper! endTok	199.09607146335782
startTok Thirdly, we must expect things to change gradually. endTok	49.25737990574243
startTok The women' s conference in Beijing brought an important point to light. endTok	67.03491122556841
startTok With the rate at which the representation of women is developing at international level, it will take 2,300 years to achieve a balance between men and women. endTok	35.7950569781784
startTok As far as Europe is concerned, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, where there is a quota for the involvement of women, it will take 25 years to achieve balanced representation. endTok	21.563843079044066
startTok The second approach is a compulsory legislative commitment on the representation of women. endTok	31.160805223381672
startTok Quotas alone are not enough. endTok	44.50285951252148
startTok If only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history. endTok	176.2233061956906
startTok On this we are clear. endTok	66.78480738169937
startTok Quotas are one of the ways, one of the policies needed to bring about change. endTok	46.058306780798574
startTok Finally, on the question of whether, as the product of quotas, we can be proud, I would reply categorically that I would be very proud to be the product of a quota because it would mean that I had managed to impose quotas on Greece, where the level of representation of women is 5%. endTok	49.52980151310423
startTok Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou. endTok	11.717829204834366
startTok I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2). endTok	13.948040349799841
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place tomorrow morning. endTok	8.444580669330163
startTok Floods in Mozambique endTok	79.03691395177127
startTok The next item is the Commission statement on flooding in Mozambique. endTok	10.495110389501422
startTok Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission. endTok	9.332332498411208
startTok The Commission is following with very great concern, as I know all honourable Members will be, the emergency situation in Mozambique. endTok	39.57505726679163
startTok The continuing torrential rains throughout the southern African region aggravated by the Cyclone Eline have led to the displacement of large numbers of people and there has been considerable damage to housing and infrastructure. endTok	23.372443119850296
startTok About 800 000 people appear to have been affected by the floods, about 300 000 are in urgent need of food and other types of humanitarian assistance. endTok	50.93389628641964
startTok Several people have lost their lives, many have disappeared, many have been injured. endTok	43.23148881901122
startTok The government of Mozambique has appealed for humanitarian aid from third countries. endTok	28.98520496768667
startTok The international community including the United States of America, Switzerland, South Africa, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Sweden and the Netherlands have to date provided substantial assistance. endTok	58.11837507387623
startTok My colleague Poul Nielson is literally on his way to Mozambique this afternoon and evening together with the Portuguese Secretary of State to assess the situation on the ground. endTok	41.96960345984376
startTok Mr Nielson will be happy to report back to Parliament on the findings of his mission. endTok	32.0497444342922
startTok Just before I say a word about the assistance which has been given by ECHO so far, perhaps I can be allowed to make three rather personal remarks. endTok	64.21229664305447
startTok First of all, from 1986 to 1989, I was an overseas development minister and I formed a particular attachment to the people of Mozambique. endTok	26.610865723478966
startTok They were bravely dealing then with huge environmental and political problems, with the problems of poverty and the consequences of a bloody war. endTok	54.56042617004144
startTok If ever a country deserved help from aid donors it was Mozambique. endTok	371.58017817943943
startTok Secondly, that feeling has been confirmed by the real efforts which Mozambique has made in the last few years to build a strong and prosperous economy and a stable society. endTok	28.438605318986983
startTok Thirdly, we spent much of this afternoon in this Chamber discussing conflict prevention, how one could prevent crises happening or how one could respond to crises more effectively. endTok	86.06016578073093
startTok We talked about the importance of the Commission developing a series of headline goals for non-military actions related to crises and, if I may say so, if ever there was a case where that is relevant, it is the disaster which has overwhelmed Mozambique. endTok	44.78650310766901
startTok Let me turn to the assistance provided so far. endTok	37.958164648518775
startTok Last week ECHO decided to allocate EUR 1 million for flood relief, of which 600 000 will be dispersed through the Spanish Red Cross and 150 000 through MSF Luxembourg, for operations in Mozambique and EUR 250 000 to Botswana through the German Red Cross. endTok	60.59271152350306
startTok These NGOs will address the most urgent need which is to move people in danger to more secure areas as well as providing health care, water and sanitation. endTok	76.56470467935777
startTok ECHO is currently preparing a second decision for a further EUR 2 million This decision will be implemented through UNICEF, Action Contre La Faim, COSV, Nuova Frontera and Vireaid pending, of course, the reception and examination of their final proposals. endTok	39.546911959940466
startTok These NGOs will be concentrating on the areas of water and sanitation, provision of shelter, plastic sheeting, jerry cans, blankets, those sorts of things. endTok	31.01031754029174
startTok They will be concentrating on the reinstallation of displaced people, on the further prevention of outbreaks of malaria, cholera and other communicable diseases, on the provision of supplementary food to malnourished and children at risk, on the provision of seeds and tools, on food security, on the rehabilitation of essential animal health structures and on the training of village livestock promoters. endTok	37.485253678227586
startTok A third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of Commissioner Nielson. endTok	23.53486711138058
startTok The Commission is also preparing a medium-term Community response combining NGO co-financing with European Development Fund operations to help Mozambique to respond to the crisis situation in re-establishing the rapid pace of growth that Mozambique had worked so hard to achieve. endTok	66.64928333980464
startTok It is envisaged that this response would link the current phase of emergency through to re-construction within a three to four years time horizon. endTok	99.05228201398829
startTok At times like this we are all aware of how much more we need to do to prevent disasters and to deal expeditiously with the disasters that we are not able to prevent. endTok	33.27961474616536
startTok I am not sure that I can add very much at this stage to the analysis of what went wrong and what we can do better but obviously we must learn any lessons that are required from this terrible calamity. endTok	33.503034564821284
startTok I repeat, Commissioner Nielson will be happy to report to Parliament when he returns from Mozambique and the scene of the disaster. endTok	30.81160771498704
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, Mozambique is a young African country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy. endTok	43.25855366148576
startTok The credit for Mozambique' s success story must be shared equally by its government, by the opposition, but above all, by the people of Mozambique. endTok	50.54940735525307
startTok There is a risk, however, that all the effort that has been made in recent years, after all the problems with the peace agreements, with which we are all familiar, will have been wasted as a result of the natural forces that have been unleashed on Mozambique over the last few weeks. endTok	24.992528197863354
startTok The current figures reaching us on the extent of the disaster are terrifying, as the Commissioner has already said: around one million people homeless and more than one hundred thousand on top of roofs or trees, waiting for a helicopter to come and save them. endTok	44.467753245433414
startTok There have already been hundreds of deaths. endTok	41.15414840113441
startTok The EU and some of its Member States, including my own, have provided emergency financial aid, perhaps a little later than they should have, but they have done so, as have the United States and various countries in the region, particularly South Africa. endTok	59.488556030749315
startTok It is now obvious that the main priority is for rescue helicopters, followed immediately by food aid and other emergency humanitarian aid. endTok	50.1124722474643
startTok Although these floods began three weeks ago, the whole world has finally begun to wake up to the dire straits Mozambique currently finds itself in: there are thousands of people whose lives are hanging by a thread and who will soon die unless we arrange transport, particularly air transport, to get them out of the situation they are in. endTok	61.44577033203377
startTok This is undoubtedly the greatest priority at the moment: search and rescue transport and emergency humanitarian aid, including food aid. endTok	63.274982165023914
startTok I would like to emphasise, however, that the EU and the rest of the world must not limit their aid to Mozambique to the emergency that we are now discussing. endTok	18.90183134359668
startTok We must be aware of the aftermath of the floods. endTok	10.63095224950484
startTok It is therefore now becoming urgent for us to start considering how we can find financial resources to rebuild the infrastructure that has been destroyed and without which Mozambique cannot continue on the path towards development on which it set out a few years ago in such a promising way. endTok	47.611067407260116
startTok Rebuilding infrastructure is crucial, because otherwise there can be no development. It is also time for some creditor countries to think about writing off or reducing Mozambique' s debts. endTok	77.74895476421273
startTok If nothing is done now, we will be letting all the effort that we have made in the past to help Mozambique in its development go to waste. endTok	46.11464159194536
startTok I therefore hope that the visit by Commissioner Nielson and representatives of the Portuguese presidency this week will enable us to treat this extremely important issue with the seriousness it deserves. endTok	25.126084183461856
startTok Mr President, it has already been said that, after a war which engulfed the country in misery, Mozambique is now facing a natural disaster of terrifying proportions. endTok	34.43272517203136
startTok Although it is currently impossible to calculate how many people have died, we do know that around 80 000 are in imminent danger of drowning and 300 000 have lost their homes and crops. endTok	41.3172602495869
startTok They urgently need aid such as food, water and shelter in order to survive. endTok	59.97760559344391
startTok This immediate need will subsequently be replaced by a requirement for medicine to prevent epidemics, which have apparently already broken out, and aid for reconstruction. endTok	72.39497689737448
startTok However, the aid needed now is difficult to get through, despite the efforts of the NGOs, because the roads, bridges and railway lines are damaged. endTok	81.43767230960091
startTok Helicopters are therefore needed. endTok	50.515263756334924
startTok Apparently there are only five at the moment to rescue about 80 000 people from trees. endTok	59.123950548974285
startTok The machinery mobilising the aid is too slow. endTok	55.70017515966093
startTok The PSE Group of this House has suggested that preventing natural disasters, including preventing conflicts, is the best way of avoiding situations like the one now being suffered by the people of Mozambique. endTok	56.1105962701551
startTok I must remind you in particular of the efforts of Mr Rocard during the previous term. endTok	29.619720439466864
startTok The European Commission responded in 1994 by setting up a disaster preparedness programme known as DIPECHO. This was intended to be proactive and, using a regional approach, to prevent disasters or at least to minimise their effects on the population. endTok	57.64231399933764
startTok However, Africa is surprisingly not included in the DIPECHO plans. endTok	52.95528356871547
startTok Mozambique, which is now suffering a foreseeable disaster, just as the famine now threatening in Ethiopia was foreseeable, is excluded from these plans. endTok	124.74986277275626
startTok The DIPECHO agenda includes south-east Asia, Central America and the Caribbean. endTok	81.96532182193631
startTok This is reasonable and we support this, but we have to ask the Commissioner, why not Africa? endTok	54.641696951651724
startTok The PSE Group has always supported the Commission' s humanitarian aid policy. endTok	21.482211440705196
startTok We have always supported ECHO, its policies and its actions, even some which have been disputed by certain bodies. We believe that solidarity must be the distinctive feature of the EU' s external action. endTok	53.314671067800084
startTok In view of all this, we also believe the time has come to demand a redoubled effort by the Commission and the Member States, on behalf of those who are now drowning in Mozambique. endTok	26.346378663963282
startTok The EUR 1 million which has so far been made available is completely inadequate in view of the needs which have been assessed by the Mozambican Government at 65 million dollars. endTok	38.707283787299026
startTok The time has also come to demand greater efficiency. endTok	58.88176691379661
startTok We hope that the debate at the beginning of this afternoon, the Commissioner' s knowledge of the situation in Mozambique and the visit by Mr Nielson will lead to a major effort being made by all sides to help Mozambique. endTok	29.351901697342647
startTok Mr President, the situation in Mozambique is of the greatest urgency. endTok	23.27042912508954
startTok Each day, each hour of delay costs many lives. endTok	455.02625894010004
startTok There are only a few helicopters available to save tens of thousands of victims. The water levels continue to rise. endTok	52.27028530455376
startTok Starvation and epidemics seem inevitable. endTok	61.75041879552646
startTok It is as if the whole world is looking on, helplessly. endTok	47.11873391261495
startTok The question is whether the Commission has reacted with sufficient alertness. endTok	23.821266168082825
startTok I must admit that I have my doubts about this. endTok	14.40507542501847
startTok Commissioner Nielson is flying out today. In European terms, this may be swift action, but given the emergency in Mozambique, this is probably very late. endTok	70.76841359607722
startTok Unlike a number of Member States, the European Union has promised only very limited aid so far. endTok	42.41695241047318
startTok What options does the Commission have, to offer effective help fast? endTok	87.65847311014006
startTok What could emergency and reconstruction aid consist of? endTok	220.34469154325456
startTok Can Commissioner Patten update us on the international coordination so far? endTok	83.79495978829723
startTok Why was it not possible to come to the rescue with a larger number of helicopters sooner? endTok	47.375249858132115
startTok The international community could also help Mozambique in an act of generosity by cancelling its debts, not only because the country has adopted a relatively sound policy, but especially because the extent of human suffering makes this absolutely essential. endTok	74.50142072538057
startTok Mr President, all the reports and pictures reaching us bear witness to the scale of the tragedy afflicting Mozambique. endTok	92.25703787325317
startTok There are thousands and thousands of displaced persons, a large number of dead, a lack of food and drinking water, and homes and crops have been destroyed. endTok	45.419068843621794
startTok And this is happening in a country which, because it is one of the poorest in the world, does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary. endTok	38.76976520528989
startTok It is therefore vital for the EU and its Member States to intervene in a way which will enable us to provide this country and its people with rapid and exceptional help. endTok	31.657501292613794
startTok We know that because of the dramatic nature of the situation, representatives of the Portuguese Presidency and Commissioner Nielson left today for Mozambique. endTok	38.57436322365138
startTok We are pleased about this development, but what is more crucial than their presence is that they should guarantee that a short and medium-term action plan will be adopted and implemented immediately. This should be done in conjunction with the Mozambican government and this plan must be able to secure the aid that the situation requires. endTok	42.483659523036295
startTok Furthermore, it was precisely for this reason, and also because I am convinced that what we really need now is urgent and exceptional action, that I spoke today to Commissioner Nielson - just before he left - in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. I asked him to join us, as soon as he returns, to inform us about how the situation is developing and particularly about the emergency measures which the EU has already taken, and those which we are going to take. endTok	43.005508853823805
startTok Thousands upon thousands of human lives are in danger at the moment, and only international solidarity can save them. endTok	51.29162164799514
startTok I would like to think that the EU is up to the task of providing the people of Mozambique with what they expect from us. endTok	27.433037295976344
startTok Mr President, I would like to begin by emphasising, first of all, the timing and the topicality of this debate on the devastating floods in Mozambique. endTok	15.215978113710175
startTok Indeed, these floods and appalling weather have resulted in many thousands of people losing their homes and all of their possessions, people who cannot return to their homes after the storms, purely and simply because their homes and their belongings no longer exist. They are no longer there, having been swept away in the torrents. endTok	57.15358025510499
startTok Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there remains, however, one immediate problem: the need to provide help for all Mozambicans who have been afflicted, many of whose lives are in danger, in their flooded villages, hoping that they will be rescued. endTok	37.12589833999494
startTok Most of these people can only be saved by aircraft, especially helicopters, of which it is clear that too few are in action. endTok	51.351382263160126
startTok As the President of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano, remarked in a dramatic appeal, each passing day may mean death for many Mozambicans. endTok	112.39400643297475
startTok The EU must therefore mobilise resources immediately and effectively, in terms of quantity as well as quality, and it must employ the most rapid and appropriate means of achieving this. endTok	48.84827579102471
startTok We must do this not only in line with basic humanitarian principles and out of solidarity, but also - and quickly - because we know that Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world. This means that its resources for coping with the tragedy and then setting about reconstruction are practically non-existent. endTok	60.483594894295216
startTok We are also under an obligation to help because of another fact, the fact that Mozambique is one of the few African countries to have used democratic means to recover from the bloody civil war by which it was consumed for several years after it gained independence. endTok	54.13138083713113
startTok It is true that Mozambique' s democracy is still far from perfect, as shown by the way in which the results of the recent presidential elections were contested and doubts were cast upon them. endTok	61.1736829062652
startTok But given this situation, which is so tragic for the people of Mozambique, we must not fail to provide an effective and appropriate response to the appeals of Mozambique' s leaders, both those in the government and those in opposition, who, out of a sense of responsibility, have resisted from resorting to violence again as a means of solving their problems. endTok	54.67949004314618
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to add my voice to all those who have already spoken in order to draw this House' s attention - which was not really necessary, but it had to be done - to the appalling tragedy unfolding in Mozambique. I have some figures here, which I believe are the most up-to-date ones available. endTok	34.804502193375626
startTok More than three hundred people have already died, six hundred and fifty thousand have become displaced, two million four hundred thousand people have been cut off, with eighty-five thousand needing to be evacuated, some of whom are in treetops, others on roofs. endTok	53.018752202851104
startTok As has already been said, helicopters are the priority and it is equally important that there is no delay in providing this humanitarian aid. Otherwise, apart from the tragedy created by the floods, the next tragedy will arise: that of a lack of aid to the people, who will die of hunger and disease and who will die in the floods. endTok	44.5637087527426
startTok This would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all. endTok	43.42636154804806
startTok The Commissioner said a while ago that he had emotional ties with Mozambique, as I have myself, and that he therefore understands the whole tragic situation taking place and what is at stake. endTok	59.89560958154324
startTok I hope that the mission by Commissioner Nielson and the Portuguese State Secretary will provide the information that this House needs in order to understand the current situation, and what the most urgent needs are, so that we can help the people of Mozambique, who genuinely deserve our help, in their struggle for development. endTok	51.15931716991618
startTok . endTok	785.4324778346265
startTok Could I thank Commissioner Patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said, the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken Limpopo valley in Mozambique are absolutely heartbreaking. endTok	38.415713709197895
startTok Children have lost parents, families are bereft, hopeless, helpless and they have lost absolutely everything. endTok	90.8283275426534
startTok But of course, as others have said, this whole thing was predicted and predictable and the slow and very inadequate, woefully slow and woefully inadequate response is something that should dictate now that we actually do invest seriously in disaster preparedness. endTok	74.61853217554457
startTok There is a case as the Commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the logistical preparations in place. endTok	60.553285606772945
startTok This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region. endTok	58.198160091649875
startTok The Save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet. endTok	133.47137601782083
startTok 85% of the work is within an hour of Maputo so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is. endTok	86.84932733024166
startTok Also I would like to say Commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing. endTok	54.234726779403076
startTok Most of us here would not wish to boast about EUR 3 million. endTok	40.89382136770604
startTok We need far more and I hope that the Commissioner will come back with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate some of the efforts there. endTok	54.02189457897071
startTok Clearly also we need to see a massive airlift. endTok	46.0978009599336
startTok As you say tons of food, water purification equipment, tents, blankets. endTok	65.20160175934349
startTok Are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources. endTok	153.5326327331742
startTok Are we ready to pay for those resources? endTok	60.787385828171566
startTok Mozambique is, of course, one of the poorest countries in the world, but one of Africa' s great success stories with its work on economic growth, on poverty reduction, on democracy in spite, of course, of massive debt pressures. endTok	58.521299019214226
startTok Mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured. endTok	43.97610178609626
startTok How badly the disaster sets Mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country. endTok	93.08757583574031
startTok Thank you, Mrs Kinnock. endTok	18.099568353847154
startTok Mr Nogueira, we note your interest and concern about this subject but your Group is not down to speak and I must abide by the Rules of Procedure. endTok	46.35091379181064
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok Union Economy (1999) endTok	1946.952994549737
startTok The next item is the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission document 'The EU Economy 1999 Review' [C5-0081/2000 - 2000/2046(COS)]. endTok	6.222203138240178
startTok The report of the Commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the European economy which it finds promising, especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8% by the year 2001. endTok	52.55587394049025
startTok This picture in the opinion of your rapporteur has to be set against a background of sluggishness, of growth of only 1.9% per year throughout the 1990s, despite instances of higher growth rates during that decade which we were, however, unable to consolidate. endTok	101.56707654051408
startTok It would follow that if we do not wish the same old failures of the past to reassert themselves, we must use the current window of opportunity of improved economic performance in order to launch a new policy of transition into self-sustained higher growth levels in our economy. endTok	54.925206910324654
startTok This is the challenge. endTok	23.10436504298506
startTok Faced with this challenge the Commission recommended essentially that our economic policy merely should prolong our past stance which limits itself to setting right the monetary and fiscal fundamentals of the economy while for the rest putting faith in the markets to work their miracle without any further intervention by conscious social agents. endTok	116.90616594448423
startTok In Europe, in your rapporteur' s opinion, this is exactly the attitude that has served us badly over past years, not just once but repeatedly. endTok	130.4541400277251
startTok Such an attitude has downside risks which I understand the ECOFIN Council is currently discussing. endTok	83.0333143695499
startTok These risks involve a correction in the US economy and the future trend in oil prices and in long-term EU interest rates. endTok	108.4785055396321
startTok Should any of these risks materialise in a negative fashion, what will be our response - more laissez faire or shall we have prepared ourselves better than in the last downturn? endTok	106.79670219543925
startTok It has been my proposal that Parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts. endTok	91.72819688282907
startTok One is to adopt the Commission' s own excellent, outstanding econometric analysis, and ask the Council to transform it into a programme of action involving certain interconnected quantifiable targets of levels of investment growth and employment that would make our commitment to a policy of full employment operational and credible. endTok	80.4855940684037
startTok A central plank of such a programme should be the raising of the level of investment of capital formation from 19%, to which it has fallen over the decade, to at least 23-24% of GDP, both in the private and in the public sector. endTok	62.201030714913806
startTok To allow the public sector to take the necessary significant lead in investment policy, the Council would indeed have to sacrifice some of its most sacred cows. endTok	58.71208976909185
startTok It would need to revise its negative attitude towards the big infrastructure programmes of trans-European networks, which have been gathering dust in the drawers for rather too long, to allow them to be financed on an adequate scale by means of European Community bonds and to accept an interpretation of the concept of budget deficits which would allow governments to borrow for purposes of investment without falling foul of the restrictions of the stability pact. endTok	64.79660463294604
startTok This was the first pillar of my recommendation. endTok	34.7760266772617
startTok The second pillar consisted of embracing a large number of structural reforms, privatisation, de-regulation proposals, as well as suggestions facilitating the transition to a knowledge-based economy which, as we know, constitutes the backbone of the proposals of the presidency for the Lisbon Summit. endTok	68.42537741094003
startTok It has been repeatedly stated by expert opinion that the programme of structural reforms combined with an expansionary programme of investment and growth is capable of pulling the European economy out of its state of inertia while one-sided policies are condemned to fail. endTok	87.17004041868695
startTok Unfortunately my colleagues of the People' s Party aided and abetted by the Liberals in the Economic Affairs Committee found my approach unacceptable. endTok	75.28234689370463
startTok I am glad that at least after five years of insistence they have found the target of full employment acceptable but I must say that simply referring to full employment without proposing a concrete programme towards achieving the targets smacks too much of lip service and is too unconvincing to serve as the political message of optimism that people expect from us, have been expecting from us rather too long. endTok	98.27282839656559
startTok It is certainly not my task to judge other people' s alliances but if the People' s Party and the Liberals are so desperate to cement their alliance, let them at least propose something positive, something that has a chance of working, not repeat the same tired old platitudes, ideas that have so singularly failed us in the past, nor oppose other people' s concrete efforts just for the sake of opposing them. endTok	79.84310597850893
startTok I believe that the political message of this Parliament should consist of something more original than a mere rehash of the neo-classical economic mantra. endTok	30.72262141199399
startTok Something more robust than a call to surrender to the fatalities of the market economy, something more decent than opposing dutiful aims but denying them the means of their realisation. endTok	82.36923186339078
startTok The report which has come to you from the Economic Committee sins in all these respects. endTok	39.5079151623671
startTok Unless it is restored in its original form by Parliament, accepting the amendments retabled by the Socialist Group, I must take the unusual but inevitable course of asking my Socialist colleagues and indeed anybody who believes that Parliament should speak a meaningful language to vote against the report that bears my name but that is no longer mine either in thinking or in conscience. endTok	77.65240099009816
startTok Mr President, Mr Katiforis' passion and conviction have prevented him from carrying out the usual task of a rapporteur in plenary which is to defend his report. endTok	43.316276343540714
startTok Instead he has defended his own position which was not the one approved in committee. endTok	126.17145248544615
startTok We clearly have different views, one of which is that we believe the development of the European economy can be regarded with confidence. endTok	49.89386466928397
startTok Yesterday, when speaking to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Commissioner Solbes specifically indicated that the prospects for this year and next for the European economy are excellent. endTok	53.31745489505492
startTok Moreover, several countries were mentioned whose problem is what to do with the public surplus. endTok	111.99635004620198
startTok They are having to choose, for example, between reducing taxes or reducing the public deficit, but clearly avoiding any price rises, or - so there is no misunderstanding - creating a special reserve for future situations in which welfare may be needed, given the EU' s population growth. endTok	85.54387871527565
startTok We are inclined to believe that a solid basis exists for this economic growth in the Union, now and in the coming years. It must be taken into account that we have an open, globalised and very competitive economy. endTok	33.72673202689379
startTok In order to reach and even overtake the leading position of the United States of America, we must avoid interventionism, as proposed initially by Mr Katiforis, and also excessive intervention by the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures. endTok	35.241181516522076
startTok Furthermore, the Member States refused to contribute more funds when we discussed Agenda 2000 which means that there will be little available over the next few years at Union level. endTok	89.73672041525114
startTok However, we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the European internal market which still has some serious flaws. endTok	38.06240889373232
startTok There are still sectors such as air transport, energy and telecommunications in which, if we compare our unit cost with that of the USA or other countries which are equally competitive at international level, the cost supported by our companies is very high. endTok	73.02636925557496
startTok This report contains information which shows that in order to create a new company the bureaucratic cost in the USA is EUR 500 and in the European Union, on average, it is EUR 1 600. endTok	40.40316367108778
startTok We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention. endTok	59.621458805105945
startTok It is only by complying with the essential agreements established with the programmes following on from the stability pact and by developing a market with less obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness required by the European Union. endTok	62.93111588363788
startTok Mr President, the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in Mr Katiforis, in my view, only served to call on the European Parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people, social outcasts and those living a precarious existence in our European Union. endTok	38.26980439058965
startTok This is the objective, in respect of which he called upon the European Parliament: give hope to the people of Europe. endTok	37.59478661638196
startTok There is indeed economic recovery, but it only marginally reduces unemployment in Europe. endTok	73.47863517897382
startTok The votes of the PPE-DE and the Liberals have very considerably diminished, and even reversed, the meaning of his message. endTok	59.63718251713756
startTok That is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them, despite our efforts, and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment. endTok	26.15418555819131
startTok What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report? endTok	34.12262425990349
startTok First of all, the affirmation that there is room for a Europe of growth, but a Europe of sustainable growth, that particularly respects the commitments of the European Union at the conferences in Kyoto and Buenos Aires. endTok	37.000287187501876
startTok There is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year 2008, by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions. endTok	46.378659899748904
startTok A tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport, energy saving and even in substituting travel by communication via the Internet. endTok	54.894180077239184
startTok Secondly, even the growth rate of 3 or 4%, something we consider eminently feasible, will not be sufficient to reduce unemployment if we do not improve the job content of this growth. endTok	83.23616101190697
startTok And we should say so very clearly, it will involve more savings on services, more third systems, more reductions in average working hours, whatever methods we adopt to achieve these things. endTok	173.44224955987536
startTok Thirdly, we fully agree that it is necessary to reform labour relations in Europe, but that clearly means for us that we must protect and enrich the human capital. endTok	55.826530970009436
startTok The lesson learned from the European experience is that where wages are lowest, where the salary ratio is the most flexible, unemployment is the highest and where wages are highest, where the social relations are the best regulated, the unemployment rate is the lowest. endTok	65.2027521197116
startTok Mr President, I think that this policy will engender not hope, but deep disappointment in European workers. endTok	60.141303613418124
startTok The vote adopted by our committee proves that it is not only the European Commission, ECOFIN and the Central Bank, but also the European Parliament which advocates and stands for an acutely neo-liberal economic and social policy which has already eroded the living and working conditions of workers and the wider working classes in the Member States of the European Union. endTok	26.883083712706078
startTok Our committee emphatically rejected any attempt on the part of the rapporteur to use his report to introduce a different dimension into the debate on the economic situation in the European Union and to send the Commission and the Council the sort of message which the European Parliament should send out as the parliamentary body elected by the people of the European Union. endTok	34.0731802031461
startTok Even the positive contribution of the international financial institutions and high-level experts, who gave the benefit of their concerns and ideas, failed miserably to muster any support. endTok	104.53902550595275
startTok With this vote, the European Parliament has accepted serious liability towards the people who elected it, by supporting an extreme neo-liberal economic and social policy; a policy which promotes the privatisation of absolutely everything, categorically opposes any form of public sector, overturns workers' employment, wage, social and insurance rights, imposes a policy of budgetary austerity which is acutely anti-social and unpopular and acts on behalf of employers by asking workers to become more attractive and employable if they want to find a job. endTok	89.6151514270334
startTok Our Group categorically condemns this perception and, in this sense, does not intend to support this resolution. endTok	37.20074233336849
startTok It will be voting against it. endTok	31.644816089765428
startTok Mr President, the report presented by the Commission on the Union Economy in 1999 appears to us to be mostly utter waffle as it scarcely shows why our performance remains hopelessly below the potential that the immense human resources of Europe should allow. endTok	51.40122370537497
startTok Indeed, it is good to note that the forecast of 3% growth for the year 2000, which could have seemed rather bold when the Commission announced it in November 1999, now has a serious chance of being achieved, even in the context of continued inflation, since the peak of 2% for the euro zone in January, nevertheless remains quite minor compared with the past. endTok	63.667857775376504
startTok But we have the impression that this growth, sustained firstly by the performance of the United States, and then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by the new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general world situation, even despite our handicaps. endTok	53.05202020071714
startTok We are well aware of these handicaps, which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility, the excessive mandatory levies. endTok	45.452628703159995
startTok But let us not forget that there is another one, a new handicap, with the single currency. endTok	21.512794722043804
startTok In fact, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances. endTok	35.6956607846723
startTok This unification is considered to be positive by the Commission' s report. endTok	22.023885337383945
startTok But, in reality, we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation. endTok	35.76621445202814
startTok If you add the strangeness of a single currency that is not built upon a State, itself based upon a people, you can easily explain what remains a great mystery in Brussels, the markets' suspicion of the euro. endTok	68.86208470289614
startTok Indeed, it was possible to welcome the weakness of the single currency initially in 1999, as it favoured growth in an unexpected way, but you cannot for ever hide the fact that it is, in fact, symptomatic of bad policies and bad operating conditions. endTok	65.97558843983542
startTok Mr President, the present draft resolution is controversial. Given the topic it covers, this is hardly surprising. endTok	46.19146972843909
startTok It is, after all, a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things, especially where the future is concerned. endTok	66.61909836502585
startTok The carefree appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment, but it is, in fact, a short-term policy. endTok	44.20741377804598
startTok Even if he advocates sustainable growth, sustainability does not come into it. endTok	77.72363762466752
startTok Given the environmental and demographic developments, if anything, we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy. endTok	57.91990167147599
startTok More investments, production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity. endTok	640.0122349263485
startTok The use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced endTok	46.594906024688186
startTok Other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes. endTok	104.68887647290143
startTok If Member States do not do anything about this, there will be even fewer means for care, education and other important public amenities in the future. endTok	58.79266180501559
startTok An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd. endTok	64.95815205280704
startTok It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which, at 2%, is now at its maximum permitted level. endTok	79.72304060804788
startTok If, despite this, there is a desire to increase public spending, then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again. endTok	75.80802478860501
startTok What the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular. endTok	34.433948394568446
startTok High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us, especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting. endTok	36.44983798635874
startTok Promoting employment, however, is a long-winded affair and comes under structural policy. endTok	78.41638440814305
startTok Member States, in particular, should adopt an effective policy. endTok	72.89263729333993
startTok In order to achieve this, they must be given the necessary leeway. endTok	17.60272420951748
startTok Rigidity by imposing social convergence criteria and other Community guidelines certainly does not create the necessary jobs. endTok	86.5197684485495
startTok However, shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and minerals is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution. endTok	58.606387748786524
startTok Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis on the report he presented to us. Not the report he presented to us here today, but the one he presented to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because politically speaking, these are two completely different reports. endTok	24.695250014740974
startTok In very general terms, we could call the first report a left-wing one, as it addresses social issues as well as economic ones. The report we have before us now and which Mr Katiforis is reluctant to defend - and I think that he is right in this - is a hybrid report, from which the main conclusions have been removed, and is based on social concerns. endTok	57.70270486234504
startTok What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report? endTok	52.41472208198526
startTok He proposed an ambitious report, based on an optimistic Europe, which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve. endTok	83.05703418530669
startTok And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets. endTok	85.4726066283993
startTok Why, for example, was the proposal to increase Europe' s active population to 75% of the total population removed, when we currently have levels of around 60%? endTok	119.03102056999516
startTok An active population of 60% is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries' levels of production with such a low rate of employment. endTok	54.70298705489101
startTok We therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive. endTok	44.433596322668755
startTok As has been advocated for the Lisbon Summit, we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training. endTok	43.717473327344955
startTok We also need investment to grow at a faster rate. endTok	47.05982606523913
startTok We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau, according to which what we need is a flexible workforce. endTok	31.9006218566619
startTok I would like to counter this with the example of Portugal, where employment laws are not flexible, and where unemployment stands at less than 5% - and has been steadily decreasing over the last few years - because investment is increasing, with Community support of course, at a rate considerably higher than the Community average. endTok	74.89279433104088
startTok What we want, therefore, is for Europe to enjoy economic growth, but also be prepared to address social issues. endTok	63.46880073177947
startTok Mr President, like many others, I want to thank Mr Katiforis for an interesting report. endTok	15.377822417471283
startTok When I read the report and see the picture of the EU' s economy that is described there, I think it is quite a worrying picture. endTok	37.31040462252514
startTok Investment levels are too low, unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth. endTok	57.961288756408344
startTok It is not, therefore, perhaps so strange that the euro is continuing to lose ground to other currencies, in spite of rumours to the effect that the European Central Bank is purchasing the euro on the quiet in order to support it. endTok	33.01139730625692
startTok The rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself, which is something I agree with. endTok	42.15539079306447
startTok There is far too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development. endTok	62.63966601099073
startTok As far as I am concerned, EMU cooperation looms ponderously large as a colossus which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present swelling economy. endTok	64.51195573543959
startTok My conclusions about this differ completely, however, from those of the previous speaker. endTok	112.08936505121315
startTok I believe we have to place our confidence in human resources, partly through a macro-economic policy which creates demand and potential new jobs and partly - and perhaps above all - by relying upon measures in the workplace such as training, democratisation and good social conditions. endTok	82.11342791481576
startTok In this context, I can, in fact, see the EMU project' s main weakness, for it is true that you cannot act like Superman and raise the European economies from above. endTok	77.48521669432876
startTok Instead, you have to mobilise working people and the people out there in the Member States. endTok	52.82706272797791
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, I have the feeling that some of the previous speakers have not read the 1999 annual report on the Union economy in its entirety and have made a conscious decision not to listen to my Group' s spokesman, Karl von Wogau, for the document that we are debating today, and which has had a report written on it, points to the fact that the introduction of the euro has been a success. endTok	29.305639169649062
startTok It points to the problems experienced in 1999, when, notwithstanding the problems, there was currency and price stability, increased employment, the beginnings of a period of upturn, and it was possible to make a start on reducing unemployment. endTok	75.46057283789689
startTok In terms of outlook, the document points to an upswing, to long-term prospects and the measures required to achieve this, which Karl von Wogau then proceeded to enlarge upon. endTok	59.586784624864585
startTok I am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one, for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy. endTok	30.568411582104684
startTok We want to continue along the successful European path to growth and employment and a functioning internal market, to hasten our progress and supplement this with the necessary measures. endTok	53.76951335262013
startTok The left-wing of this House does not want to continue along this path, rather it makes dramatic statements such as: what we need is state intervention, not the extension and consolidation of the market economy. endTok	62.97734501272991
startTok State intervention has always led to a high level of debt, and a higher level of debt has always damaged growth and employment, as well as social justice. endTok	41.52297272847468
startTok That is what the debate we are having is all about, on the subject of which I have this to say to you: we need more freedom and less state intervention. endTok	57.17418719996641
startTok It is sound framework conditions and not state intervention that enables enterprises to create growth and employment. endTok	105.37722384810169
startTok Mr President, the economic situation of the European Union from the viewpoint of the workers is eighteen million unemployed people, it is the generalisation of insecurity, of low wages, of deteriorating working conditions. endTok	34.47354186066898
startTok The Commission has the cynicism to consider wage restraint as a positive factor, whereas in France alone, over three million workers receive a salary that is close to the poverty line and they barely survive any better than the other three million people kept unemployed by an insane economy. endTok	83.80650802708058
startTok But you never speak of restraining the income of shareholders that is infinitely higher from the outset and which increases shockingly every year. endTok	80.89023475129038
startTok What you have as a result are all these major trusts that cut jobs while their profits are high, and which often make staff redundant simply to make their share price rise on the stock market. endTok	139.2994534858353
startTok Eleven thousand job losses at Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, twenty two thousand at Unilever, ten thousand at ABB/Alsthom Power, not to mention all the others. endTok	77.53648028558813
startTok The economic growth on which you pride yourself only benefits a fortunate minority, the owners and shareholders of the large industrial and banking groups. endTok	79.56964615619898
startTok But beware of the backlash from the workers and the unemployed, who we keep telling that everything is getting better and better while they find that their lives are not improving but, on the contrary, are getting worse. endTok	66.67690662543725
startTok This is the key ideological struggle for Europe facing us. endTok	35.45840532973991
startTok This debate, I think, has summed it up. endTok	90.26217116182062
startTok The key political divide has been very obviously stated this evening, and it is no surprise that this issue has polarised the debate in a House which is known for its consensus and its carve-out politics, and I am delighted to see this difference of opinion made so clear, because this report is a radical one. endTok	57.468343323582346
startTok This report is a wake-up call to Europe. endTok	73.9673776278288
startTok This report recommends radical measures, which in essence will make it easier to employ people. endTok	57.80611546502203
startTok It is as simple as that. endTok	43.69457986558421
startTok The reason why we have such crippling unemployment rates in Europe is that it is too difficult in many cases to employ people because of the red tape and the regulation and the inflexibility of the labour markets. endTok	33.81545317236333
startTok This is the only way to go forward, because the real way to deliver social justice in Europe - and after all that is what we are all here to do - is to deliver prosperity and opportunities and jobs. endTok	44.46260100180541
startTok This report signals very clearly the most effective way to do that, because Europe has to wake up. endTok	46.11338822602355
startTok It cannot create jobs just by government spending. endTok	115.66279477066738
startTok It cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours, as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people. endTok	82.35709625393181
startTok The real world simply does not work like that. endTok	94.70036274581797
startTok And if Europe wants to be left behind, left behind to stagnation and to unemployment and to statism and to corporatism, than yes, vote against this report tomorrow. endTok	93.49465440701105
startTok But if you want Europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of Europe, then I would call upon you all to give your support to this report, because it will deliver those jobs, and it will deliver those opportunities, and it is the only way to do so. endTok	36.28655740858836
startTok Mr President, the original version of the Giorgos Katiforis report had the great merit of making strong recommendations, based on the precise observations of the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe, for a European Union strategy capable of giving continuity and stability to the sustainable development prospects emerging this year for all the countries of our continent. endTok	36.113252682709046
startTok These recommendations concerned the need for effective coordination of the Union' s economic policies and the need to overcome the way that economic policy is managed separately from social policy, which has hitherto been a serious barrier to the definition of a coherent strategy for fighting unemployment and moving towards full employment. endTok	44.47560997589162
startTok It is this absence of management of the European economy which is responsible, my dear Mr von Wogau, for the fall of the euro. endTok	38.15941470797813
startTok The report also contained recommendations concerning the creation of a European research area and the promotion in all countries of the Union of converging measures on research, lifelong learning and employability which would overcome any sort of unfair competition between the States in the field of taxation. endTok	50.63747503487179
startTok Lastly, the recommendations also incorporated an updated version of the proposals in President Delors' White Paper on the promotion of a European project for the development of a common network of infrastructures and services. endTok	45.329516852570656
startTok These recommendations, which, for the most part, are consistent with the guidelines in the Portuguese presidency' s work programme and which will therefore be discussed at the Lisbon Summit, have been rejected or distorted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of this Parliament, by a majority which only managed to achieve a fragile unity in its rejection of the idea of a European Union which is founded on the convergence of national policies and not just on the grouping together of markets. endTok	37.722209161846905
startTok Mr President, this Parliament, which has shown itself to be highly Europeanist so many times, must, on this occasion, show that it can express a majority vote for a political union of Europe which is capable of dealing with market weak spots and failures. endTok	45.35093136670494
startTok Mr President, Mr Katiforis' s report is exciting. endTok	7.849952932641134
startTok In its original form, it points the way towards a renewed economic policy which aims at something more than merely tightening up and balancing the economy. endTok	56.03014634648589
startTok Now, finally, the EU' s position is, of course, such that we can achieve high growth and seriously take up the fight against unemployment without jeopardising objectives such as price stability and a balanced budget. endTok	66.80264323048341
startTok It is therefore sad that, in committee, the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party should have voted down the proposals which take the fight against unemployment seriously. endTok	18.41158488212832
startTok The debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this. endTok	84.79742516193285
startTok It is nonetheless gratifying that we should have united behind some of the strategically important proposals, namely that the Union' s economic policy ought to prioritise investments, partly in order to involve all the Union' s citizens in the information society, something which can also be of major significance from an economic point of view. endTok	44.31453355868272
startTok I am also thinking of the importance of strengthening the applicant States' links with trans-European networks in the shape of both physical forms of transport and IT infrastructure. endTok	35.941495459706005
startTok This is important for growth but also in order to avoid gulfs developing between people, both within the EU and between the EU and the applicant States. endTok	29.275777943819747
startTok The applicant States ought not merely to tag along behind but, instead, share the EU' s ambition of becoming a world leader in the communications field. endTok	85.41601457256097
startTok Society needs, therefore, to take responsibility for the rapid and vigorous expansion of a modern IT infrastructure which also reaches small companies, poor regions and ordinary citizens. endTok	89.3656889857076
startTok We have that opportunity right now. Let us grasp it. endTok	99.62315856943297
startTok Mr President, the advantage of speaking at the end of such a debate is that you can react to what has been said before. endTok	28.519337364755195
startTok I would like to say that I strongly disagree with Mrs Villiers' view that this is such an interesting debate. endTok	15.623474025784853
startTok I think that the European Parliament is doing itself absolutely no favours by thinking only in terms of old categories and churning out old political concepts and visions. endTok	44.97777847836706
startTok It would have been much better if we had actually made the effort to reach compromises and to develop a common vision. endTok	33.81259926256712
startTok I think that, in this way, the European Parliament is excluding itself from the discussion at the very moment that an extremely interesting development is taking place in the European Union where a very wide, socio-economic agenda is being drawn up much more clearly. endTok	28.104028888757966
startTok The Portuguese presidency has submitted a wide agenda of this kind for the extra summit in Lisbon. endTok	36.872103174743025
startTok The Commission has done this in its five-year plan by listing one of the four priorities. endTok	31.181354051524853
startTok The Commission document too, which is being drafted for the summit in Lisbon, takes precisely such a wide approach which covers different areas. endTok	60.05455911104047
startTok I think that in adopting this wide socio-economic approach, the European Union is taking exactly the right line, not least because that is the economic entity on the basis of which policy is drafted. endTok	39.762946107049395
startTok In this light, I think that the European Parliament' s role will be limited in Lisbon, but also in the forum in June for which we might have an invitation, but are unsure as to the input we can have. endTok	42.24970067058597
startTok Are we going to have nothing more to report than the fact that we are still stuck in a mould of old political contradictions? endTok	36.07340145097523
startTok . (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I must thank this House for its serious and detailed work. endTok	21.49604976519306
startTok There is no doubt that the hearings of experts and the debates in committee have provided us with additional high-quality information. endTok	33.2127546727157
startTok There is also no doubt that, throughout the debate this afternoon, we have heard differing opinions about the possible policies. endTok	34.31886882415199
startTok However, I believe that there are also some elements of consensus. endTok	24.606850116522903
startTok We all agree that the current economic conjuncture is good. endTok	25.070135156344577
startTok We also agree about trying to further and benefit from this situation in order to improve conditions and about aiming for a definite improvement in employment. endTok	43.30716852993244
startTok I will briefly comment on these issues before concentrating on the last point which I regard as the essential issue in today' s debate. endTok	41.72871451718323
startTok Yesterday, as some of you have noted, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs referred to the improvement in the economic situation in Europe. endTok	20.247520101503714
startTok We currently believe that this improvement, which we highlighted in the perspectives in November, may lead to even better results than initially forecast. endTok	76.60706671374676
startTok Employment is growing at a good rate. endTok	77.68384374436165
startTok Despite yesterday' s figures, we certainly consider that the fact that inflation was around 2% in December shows that this is an issue which must be pursued. However, the rate of underlying inflation demonstrates that the inflationist tendencies are due to certain very specific elements such as the rise in oil prices and exchange rate developments. endTok	56.08855397216948
startTok When we submitted our report, we referred to the risks posed by growth. endTok	60.82275865095226
startTok We basically highlighted the possibility of encountering difficulties in terms of growth in the USA, and therefore in other parts of the world, and of a sudden rise in inflation. endTok	32.38294987129306
startTok This latter issue may be particularly significant if it causes cost-push inflation. This is why we are continuing to talk about the need for a wages policy compatible with the definitions of inflation which we want to establish. endTok	47.19356665492938
startTok Parliament' s analysis has highlighted another issue which is the development of risk in the stock markets. endTok	45.17793770615358
startTok The Commission regards this as significant although we do not believe that this is the basic problem. endTok	34.35416885395278
startTok Anyway, we currently have some excellent opportunities to do more. endTok	66.99678813934713
startTok We all agree that, after a decade of very weak growth and intolerable unemployment, certain action must be taken. endTok	53.56568363109886
startTok We need public and private investment. endTok	53.93714748553513
startTok Our levels of research and development are too low compared with our competitors and our low level of employment reflects, among other factors, the imbalances in our labour market. endTok	48.98431939769765
startTok Our aim must therefore be to make this reactivation of the economy long-lasting with strong growth and job creation. endTok	58.59920614306779
startTok The latter element continues to be the Commission' s fundamental objective, as we indicated in the Prodi document submitted for your debate at the Lisbon Summit, in that we are aiming for full employment in the medium term. endTok	34.62480066750694
startTok What policy should we use to achieve these objectives? endTok	52.63624199915763
startTok In our opinion, the Union' s economy is reactivating but we still have idle production capacity, not only in terms of physical capital but also new sources of jobs. endTok	39.800723778069155
startTok The policy mix to be applied should specifically allow this capacity to be fully absorbed. endTok	44.36867205693431
startTok We must define a macro-economic policy which aids growth. endTok	58.1962730511652
startTok This is not an expansionist policy in the sense of growth for growth' s sake. endTok	31.544795804395743
startTok It is simply a budgetary policy which can be coherent with price stability but which also allows us to have an appropriate monetary policy which contributes to growth. endTok	47.04576958405993
startTok This policy mix will undoubtedly be good for investment and will lead to growth. endTok	40.411843814618706
startTok The EU' s potential for growth must pay particular attention to certain factors, on most of which I believe we agree with Parliament' s analysis. endTok	39.18018629575045
startTok Firstly, private investment must be assisted. endTok	96.94805870523413
startTok The Union must help to promote the spirit of enterprise and to generate employment in this way, but without forgetting public investment. endTok	41.98903024735336
startTok This has been the major victim in recent years and any improvements in public finances must lead to improvements in public investment. However, this must be carried out with respect for our tax consolidation commitments. endTok	61.953982248565694
startTok Our main support in the future must be for research and development and human capital. endTok	51.482072226032585
startTok These are two of the principal challenges for the Lisbon Summit. endTok	21.98833394042224
startTok It is essential that we tackle these challenges with quantified objectives and specific definitions. This will ultimately allow us to achieve our goal of clear improvements in productivity, thus enabling our society to grow, together with a rise in employment which will go some way towards making up the ground lost in recent years. endTok	60.50315213520373
startTok This is the policy which the Commission has defended and will continue to defend in Lisbon. endTok	21.387229041120303
startTok Common fisheries policy endTok	77.9362905066026
startTok The next item is the joint debate on the following reports: endTok	8.287329113573406
startTok A5-0038/2000 by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community framework for the collection and management of the fisheries data needed to conduct the common fisheries policy (COM(1999) 541 - C5-0302/1999 - 1999/0218(CNS)); endTok	7.0164553986070235
startTok A5-0037/2000 by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision on a financial contribution from the Community towards the expenditure incurred by the Member States in collecting data, and for financing studies and pilot projects for carrying out the common fisheries policy (COM(1999) 551 - C5-0303/1999 - 1999/0224(CNS)). endTok	10.803832500205695
startTok The proposals for a Council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a Council decision on a financial contribution in this respect are both very welcome. endTok	25.900553903331115
startTok So is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other. endTok	52.94502001288568
startTok I understand that they have been some five years in their gestation. endTok	26.075883549442647
startTok With the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002, it is important that swift progress is now made. endTok	29.948361667727983
startTok To take first the proposal for the Council regulation, this makes provision for Member States to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations. endTok	59.50762127505809
startTok Both biological and economic information are included. endTok	61.979216220645476
startTok The proposal also makes provision for Member States to produce such data in aggregated form. endTok	30.197760701495774
startTok Exactly which new data are to be collected and what is to be aggregated from these and existing data will be specified by an implementing regulation. endTok	63.16467957252342
startTok The implementing regulation will establish a minimum Community programme and an extended Community programme. endTok	93.93947572388517
startTok It appears that these programmes will not cover the whole range of potential data but will be selective, for example, by type of fish stock. endTok	43.9462933503954
startTok The proposal for the Council decision allows for the making of the financial contribution by the Community to Member States engaged in the collection and management of data. endTok	23.283504126789165
startTok It also allows the Commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects. endTok	24.830597527504708
startTok The only apparent sanction for Member States that do not completely fulfil the requirements of the minimum programme under the regulation is that they will not be eligible for any financial assistance in respect to the extended programme. endTok	40.905308300235895
startTok Two major areas of concern about the proposal were considered by the Committee. endTok	59.73853349755995
startTok The first relates to the degree of involvement of the Commission. endTok	16.377269779174313
startTok The original proposal simply allowed for the information being gathered to be transmitted to international organisations. endTok	45.885656014464026
startTok The Commission would only receive a copy of any such transmissions if it requested one. endTok	80.90605059982751
startTok Since, however, the Community is funding the exercise, it was felt appropriate for it to see a direct return on its investment. endTok	121.91984249293293
startTok Thus, Amendment No 6, while maintaining the freedom of Member States to transmit the data to international organisations, requires that it also be sent annually to the Commission. endTok	45.34692010489917
startTok This change is taken in conjunction with Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 7. endTok	20.732836150840697
startTok Amendment No 1 clarifies the point that, although the data are to be scientifically based, they are being collected for wider decision-making purposes. endTok	51.83992723234302
startTok Amendment No 4 makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally. endTok	36.60884294065931
startTok Amendment No 7 calls on the Commission to report annually on the use it has made of the data collected under the regulation. endTok	36.59850145104302
startTok It is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the Commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole. endTok	39.70223374111775
startTok The other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation. endTok	30.018904564740353
startTok First, in respect to economic data, Amendment No 2 makes two changes. endTok	136.65923374647932
startTok One attempts to ensure that the data sought are no more detailed than necessary to serve the objective being pursued. endTok	37.97866827944324
startTok The other replaces a reference to income from sales and other revenue, subsidies, interest received, etc., with a reference simply to volume of sales. endTok	106.28030578125775
startTok It is considered that without these changes undesirably high costs in the collection of data could be incurred in Member States and that there could also be serious problems of confidentiality. endTok	52.87407540521472
startTok In conjunction with these changes, Amendment No 5 deletes a reference to accounting headings accordingly. endTok	45.97011381163562
startTok Secondly, in respect to the environmental data, the original proposal speaks only of biological and economic information. endTok	50.05418922607665
startTok The Commission has, however, made it clear that it intends itself to engage in studies and pilot projects of a wider environmental kind. endTok	46.538605863653494
startTok It has also made it clear that it may wish to extend the range of data being collected by Member States at a later stage. endTok	23.998730352548375
startTok Amendment No 3 brings into the ambit of the current regulation data of the kind needed to monitor changes in aquatic ecosystems. endTok	45.19428066243079
startTok This will certainly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation concerning environmental data and may even render this unnecessary. endTok	49.60370899093916
startTok It should be stressed that the Amendment does not in any way require the Commission to include the collection of such data either under the minimum or the extended programmes it establishes. endTok	46.48856912655979
startTok It merely permits the Commission to do so should it so wish. endTok	74.86398055982981
startTok As already stated the proposal for the Council decision falls into two parts. endTok	37.922687406040254
startTok The first is concerned with financing the Member States in implementing the Community programmes. endTok	35.376446229680894
startTok The second is to allow the Commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects. endTok	42.8016858897858
startTok There are some minor amendments: Amendment No 2 aims to ensure that the financial contribution to Member States can cover not only the costs of collection of data but also those of its management, compilation, aggregation, etc. Amendments Nos 3 and 6 aim to smooth the timescale given that Member States will have to wait until the implementing regulation is in place to know what the programmes actually involve; and also to bring the timescale into line with the dates and the regulation. endTok	51.710387690390114
startTok Amendments Nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority. endTok	50.50306488300407
startTok More significantly, under Amendment No 1, the Fisheries Committee accepts the recommendation of the Budgets Committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1(b) rather than heading 3 of the Financial Perspective. endTok	77.20411147128694
startTok Although in its preliminary draft budget the Commission entered the appropriations under heading 3 'Internal Policies' , Parliament created a new budget line B1-500 to finance the measures under discussion. endTok	169.36905275383396
startTok This provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available. endTok	31.537531484988737
startTok ) Mr President, I believe we totally agree with Mrs Attwooll' s statement at the beginning of her excellent report that these two Commission proposals, intended to shed more light on the scientific and socio-economic situation of the fisheries sector, come at a critical time. endTok	37.51276347346727
startTok The proposed exhaustive collection of data and the appropriate management of this data will be very valuable in helping to tackle the revision of the common fisheries policy in a more rigorous manner. endTok	27.204071812081892
startTok This will only be true, of course, if the data can actually be obtained because, as rightly pointed out by our rapporteur, the Commission' s proposal does not establish any element of compulsion on the Member States. endTok	35.811446405851804
startTok The sending of data is completely voluntary and failure to do so will only mean that certain financial assistance, which is not very significant anyway, will not be received. endTok	57.21223142568276
startTok In view of our experience of the submission of data in the fisheries sector, as evidenced by the reports on compliance with the MAGPs, I believe that instead of obtaining a full picture of the situation in the sector, we will end up with total confusion. For example, some Member States will provide scientific data but not employment data while others will provide data on employment but none on the situation of resources, according to whether they can or want to obtain and send this data. endTok	57.77244194179746
startTok I am very much afraid that some will prefer to receive no financing rather than reveal their poor management. This has already been seen in cases where the sending of this data was compulsory, as with the MAGPs. endTok	77.6610288885825
startTok In view of this problem, which seems to me to be the most serious, the Fisheries Committee report improves the proposal in certain important points, particularly with the rapporteur' s suggestion of more reasonable submission deadlines and the request for monitoring by the Commission. endTok	53.280387256059065
startTok My Group has included two reasonable requests. endTok	137.53818091220842
startTok The first is that data originating from studies and samples should be used as a source of data whose collection could otherwise be interminable. The second is that the requirement for data referring strictly to the taxation of enterprises should be removed from the Commission' s proposal, bearing in mind that this tax data does not come within the Community competence. endTok	44.378743756493
startTok As a result, this report is very satisfactory and, on behalf of my Group, I therefore ask for its approval. endTok	30.87939815927254
startTok I wish at the outset to congratulate Mrs Attwooll on the preparation and presentation of her report. endTok	22.117260001654802
startTok I welcome the establishment of a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data which I believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various species of fish. endTok	20.058010824643432
startTok It is important, of course, that the data is both of a biological and economic nature and the information to be provided from the various Member States must be standardised across the Community and, as stated by the rapporteur in her report, must be in compliance with international provisions. endTok	39.82939157825562
startTok I welcome the availability of funding for national programmes, even taking into consideration provisions concerning the minimum programmes to be met. endTok	79.23388898380821
startTok I agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the Commission. endTok	28.4629909174017
startTok Otherwise the purpose of collecting and collating data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue. endTok	78.91606648451088
startTok Sound, factual information is in the best interests of the industry. endTok	62.853683177246175
startTok I believe that the streamlined information to be made available will be of major benefit and importance to the decision makers and to their advisers and will go some way to ensure a more sustainable fishery that will continue to provide jobs in parts of the Union where there is no alternative source of employment. endTok	49.25161400084463
startTok I am pleased to confirm that in my country they are working to ensure that the detailed practicalities, the logistics and utilisation of information are developed in the best interests of the resource of the industry and decision makers and our Group has no difficulty in supporting these reports. endTok	33.643906241921975
startTok Mr President, behind the report, which is an honest one, by Mrs Attwooll, which we shall vote for, we see the European fisheries policy. It is not easy to manage because clearly in an open sea, which is immense and without borders, it is not easy to manage fish on the move. endTok	61.26966871407954
startTok We are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating injustice. endTok	41.20262816269901
startTok It is indeed a good idea to wish to prevent the depletion of fragile resources, but what is the point if Europe restricts its catches and world catches increase? endTok	64.56651928700462
startTok What is the point of banning European drift nets in the île d' Yeu or elsewhere, if Japan, Korea and Tunisia use them and land fish here which we are not allowed to catch? endTok	55.81322247437875
startTok What is the point of destroying the French fishing fleet, at Sète or elsewhere, for example, if every year France has to spend two billion euros on importing fish caught and landed, while our fishermen are not allowed to catch it. endTok	58.25016101741476
startTok What is more, the movement of fish is like CO2 or like capital, it is not European, but world-wide. endTok	214.01639571195832
startTok Brussels, which wanted to do away with nations on the pretext that they were unsuited to the task, now in turn finds itself unsuited to managing a resource which itself is an international asset. endTok	99.59860201614043
startTok Together with Mrs Attwooll, I am in favour of collecting scientific data, and of fair and accurate checks, on condition that they do not vary according to the severity or the laxness of the administrations. I am in favour of enlightened management by marine scientists, like Professor Aubert, or others, that will make it possible to discover that the basic problems are not so much to do with industrial fishing - although it plays a serious and negative part - but more to do with plankton, the large underwater hot mass or cold mass rivers, which have a much greater effect than human influence. endTok	54.87211849361309
startTok But to enlighten the decision makers, let us practise honest science, without the ulterior motive of having the European Union finance excuses to destroy our fishing boats. endTok	64.69040460264432
startTok For if we must preserve the shoals of fish, we must also preserve the ports and the fishermen. endTok	39.32787877504187
startTok Instead of always following behind the United States, in Seattle, in Kosovo, in Iraq, perhaps the Europe of Brussels could suggest, over and above the international fishing organisations that exist in the North Atlantic, in the Pacific, over and above the regulation of tuna, cod or other things, that Europe should take the initiative and organise an international conference on fishing, a kind of Montego Bay of the fisheries resources which would be held between Peruvians, Japanese, Canadians, Russians, Europeans, and we could manage the fisheries resources scientifically as an asset common to humanity. endTok	97.05976468594358
startTok That would be good internationalism as opposed to the bad internationalism, as practised with the free exchange areas and other false friends of the OECD. endTok	73.56087877976532
startTok The Northern Ireland fishing industry has received many hard blows from this Union. endTok	57.63582766897031
startTok They have seen their own waters plundered by others while they have had to put up their own boats and desist from fishing. endTok	46.98985450998558
startTok The recent decisions on the cod quota for the Irish Sea is yet another hard blow which could well prove to be a mortal blow to the Northern Ireland fishing industry. endTok	63.390978482611665
startTok I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland, a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue. endTok	51.358177646335335
startTok The European Union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves, which have been totally rejected out of hand, for the conservation of their own fish stocks, then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard. endTok	91.50421880986185
startTok At a recent visit in Brussels these fishermen' s representatives, duly accredited, travelled from Northern Ireland and they were threatened with expulsion from the meeting when they sought to argue a case that they had very well prepared. endTok	72.52554790869172
startTok That is scandalous, their case ought to be heard. endTok	105.35752856070627
startTok It should be put on record, and I want to put it on record today. endTok	49.73207346839394
startTok I sat in the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would soon be extinct in the Irish Sea and at that very time haddock had a special, spectacular increase of breeding in the Irish Sea so the scientists can be wrong. endTok	64.34786654714745
startTok As I have said all the Northern Ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but ruination to Northern Ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this Union. endTok	62.206162065511855
startTok Mr President, Mrs Attwooll' s reports are extremely important as indeed is the prospect of having as much data as possible on the fisheries sectors of the Member States. This is particularly true given that the Commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002. endTok	29.257503319633223
startTok However, the fact that the updating and sending of data are purely optional and that this involves a very wide range of data and sectors may distort the final objective of the Commission' s proposal. endTok	28.255647100004715
startTok This has happened, as previously mentioned, with the MAGPs. These have seriously prejudiced the countries which have strictly complied with them and provided the corresponding data to the Commission, compared with other countries which have failed to comply or simply not provided the data. endTok	61.82333792880677
startTok It should be pointed out that not all the Member States have the same amount of data. endTok	21.60287452070439
startTok Some have different sectors and, in view of the volume of data to be sent, could be prejudiced compared with those which have a smaller volume of data, if the same deadlines are set. endTok	73.6272033610111
startTok These deadlines for submission must therefore be staggered accordingly. endTok	41.058857656837255
startTok Much of this data is confidential, as has also been mentioned, which could affect the competitiveness of the sectors involved and their enterprises. endTok	48.966454135446284
startTok We must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data. endTok	35.02495442523887
startTok Some of the data is also irrelevant such as that referring to the taxation of enterprises. endTok	37.942773835812744
startTok Finally, Mr President, as I must be brief given the time constraints, I must congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, on the important work which she has carried out within our committee. endTok	32.63650452896217
startTok I too want to congratulate Mrs Attwooll and say that I agree with most of what she said. endTok	24.60702025228806
startTok I regard it as a weakness in the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all Member States. endTok	35.69852894133485
startTok I cannot understand the proposal to make a regulation out of which it is possible for some Member States to slip without any penalty and I cannot understand either that within a European Union where we are only 50% self-sufficient in fish for our domestic needs that there is any highly sensitive information, that by making the reports that are necessary that the national interest or the regional interest of some states or fishing communities is going to be put at risk. endTok	73.665973002637
startTok In view of the coming review of the policy in 2002 it is important that we have all possible information, economic as well as biological. endTok	37.22235434079596
startTok In the past somebody said to me I have been defending the decisions the Commission makes. endTok	56.45317327027456
startTok It is not very easy in coastal areas anywhere in the Union to defend the European Union in the whole area of fisheries, but I have been defending them on the grounds that decisions are made on properly based scientific knowledge. endTok	36.573658914031775
startTok I am informed when I take a closer look that the information is in fact quite higgledy-piggledy with bits coming from here and there and no clear, proper economic and biological picture emerging. endTok	87.80388627561253
startTok If we do not have this picture then it will not be possible to make reasonable decisions in two years' time about the future of the policy. endTok	26.2432383967617
startTok It is not easy, indeed I could speak for everybody in my constituency that live in the coastal areas too and say that they are agreed on one thing, that the European Union is the source of all their problems and all their difficulties. endTok	41.01830148864227
startTok Well, I do not agree with them but I think if we do not base our information and our decisions on good scientific information, and if there is not an equal obligation on everyone to give it, then we will have bad decisions. endTok	47.57159238894414
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, no one could dispute the usefulness of implementing the qualitative and quantitative data on the fishing industry, particularly in view of the reform of the CFP in 2002. endTok	34.0222503406981
startTok We are also of the opinion that Community funds should be set aside to fund these activities. endTok	38.48862449707893
startTok A common fisheries policy must coordinate as well as possible the requirements for conservation of species and resource management with economic and market requirements. endTok	54.46082220534624
startTok To this end, more extensive, compatible, uniform data is required, and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the Union' s fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted. endTok	99.57960690197473
startTok However, we also expect there to be greater awareness and appreciation of the peculiarities, differences, varying situations and traditions of the fishing industries, and that they will not be disregarded, penalised or even eliminated due to the misinterpretation of the concept of harmonisation of fisheries policies, as has sometimes occurred in the past. endTok	33.317483737722725
startTok A case in point is the Mediterranean, including my country' s fishing industry. endTok	68.39412715271061
startTok After years of the CFP for the Mediterranean restricting itself to trade regulations and company aid, Regulation 1626 at last introduced a responsible fisheries policy, with measures protecting vulnerable fishery resources in order to ensure sustainable exploitation. endTok	95.1032469906414
startTok This is a worthy objective, the implementation of which, however, has sometimes revealed an ignorance of the biological characteristics of Mediterranean species of fish. endTok	50.2264637044782
startTok A subsequent regulation, Regulation 1448, adopted, not by chance, in 1999, permitted certain exemptions, in particular for special cases. endTok	250.2572897720974
startTok The time period will elapse on 31 May next, to be precise, when the Commission will present a proposal. endTok	114.33507115648379
startTok We hope that the presentation of the proposal will take into account the fact that this fishing system is vitally important for the economy of huge Italian coastal areas and that the scientific data hitherto collected demonstrate that, from the point of view of biological implications, resources are, to some extent, sustainable. endTok	38.79027255999696
startTok Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler. endTok	3.997459756967161
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.7754887131066557
startTok The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. endTok	3.285491258473609
startTok Combating certain fish diseases endTok	217.70055917703507
startTok The next item is the report A5-0036/2000 by Mr Hudghton, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 93/53/EEC introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases (COM(1999) - C5-0168/1999 - 1999/0191 (CNS)). endTok	7.029976700850363
startTok Infectious salmon anaemia is a contagious viral disease which was first recorded in Norway in 1984, then in Canada in 1986 and first found in European Union territory in May 1998 in Scotland. endTok	59.34890245217711
startTok Although the virus has been found in other species, the disease itself is so far confined to salmon. endTok	42.220196754156724
startTok The virus is known not to survive above 25o Celsius and scientists have therefore agreed that no threat to human health exists; it simply cannot survive in warm-blooded creatures. endTok	80.41393490868207
startTok The Scottish salmon-farming industry is the biggest in the EU, spread throughout some of Europe' s most peripheral communities. endTok	39.13784646487885
startTok It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually. endTok	42.96124759042054
startTok It is obvious therefore that this issue is especially important to Scotland but it is vitally important to all parts of Europe that the disease be brought under control and, if possible, eradicated. endTok	44.25419336921612
startTok The current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be slaughtered whether affected by the disease or not. endTok	67.43849335373585
startTok The intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate ISA and to do so as quickly as possible. endTok	37.87490622208058
startTok The reality is that the compulsory slaughter policy has failed even to contain, let alone eradicate ISA, and while failing to deliver its objectives, the present rule has had a devastating economic effect on the industry with no compensation being paid and no possibility of commercial insurance. endTok	86.82104686594352
startTok The proposed changes are twofold: the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle. endTok	38.397033851713175
startTok This is a necessary change and should be accompanied by a commitment at European level to instigate and fund research into developing an effective vaccine. endTok	51.59814575426234
startTok The second proposed change would permit a phased withdrawal of fish from affected farms, working to a plan based on the severity of the problem in any particular farm. endTok	67.90062469071778
startTok This approach has been used very effectively in Norway where new reports of ISA are down to a handful of cases a year having peaked at some 80-90 cases per year in the early 1990s. endTok	95.65081641219334
startTok I therefore support the Commission' s proposed changes and I am calling for their urgent adoption and implementation. endTok	45.02815367856148
startTok I also highlight the issue of compensation and call for the amendment of Council Decision 90/424/EEC by specifically including ISA in its appended list of diseases, thereby enabling compensation to be paid at 50% Commission, 50% Member State. endTok	112.11946052546622
startTok I thank colleagues in the Fisheries Committee for their overwhelming vote in support of my report and I in particular thank my Scottish colleagues in the committee for their input to this whole process. endTok	43.60298030072356
startTok I am opposing Amendments 7 to 13 which were decisively rejected by the Fisheries Committee. endTok	39.43487862903453
startTok Most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text. endTok	169.28927922625755
startTok In particular, I have drawn attention to the need to study the extent and effect of interaction between farmed and wild salmon, the need to investigate the source of ISA and the need to test more widely for the virus in wild stocks. endTok	42.88783906441834
startTok These amendments by the Green component of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group are designed to provide justification for Amendment 13. endTok	52.93243630132731
startTok This amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate as it seeks not only to retain the requirement for immediate compulsory slaughter of all fish but also to prevent any fish, whether diseased or not, from an affected farm from being sold and I must emphasise that under current policy no diseased fish are sold. endTok	64.23578556468608
startTok There is no proposal to change that and under the proposed new regime there is no question of diseased fish being sold. endTok	57.16870764439626
startTok Amendments 7 to 13 simply fail to take account of the reality as evidenced by the starkly contrasting statistics from Scotland and from Norway. endTok	62.5115400832519
startTok In Scotland we have endured a draconian regime which has failed to achieve its objective. endTok	30.339465595139863
startTok In Norway, with their much longer experience, compulsory, 100% culling was abandoned some years ago and a range of measures have led there to a dramatically improved situation. endTok	119.20386178985572
startTok It is in all of our interests to ensure that in Scotland too we contain ISA and prevent its further spread. endTok	69.4481257600379
startTok Last week saw the publication in Scotland of a report by a joint government and industry working group on ISA. endTok	99.18338974325056
startTok This comprehensive document takes account of a wide range of possible risks and recommends action to combat them in areas such as site-to-site transmission, security measures to curtail escapes, treatment of waste and effluent, methods of detection and diagnosis, farrowing and rotation, disinfection of equipment and many, many more. endTok	57.84016715867912
startTok Some can and will be implemented immediately by local authorities using existing powers, others will be incorporated into codes of practice. endTok	116.22660785335813
startTok All will be beneficial, not just in relation to ISA but in achieving better standards in aquaculture generally where required. endTok	95.94293665465446
startTok Your votes, colleagues, in favour of my report in full, as endorsed by the Fisheries Committee, will be a very important part of a wider ISA control package based on the reality of Scotland' s situation and the lessons learned from the success of others. endTok	56.505581899164355
startTok I congratulate Mr Hudghton and fully support his report and would urge the honourable Members of Parliament to do likewise. endTok	30.154888108836023
startTok As he said, fish farming is a critically significant source of employment in remote parts of rural Scotland and at a time when the rural areas of Scotland are suffering their worst recession in over a hundred years, the aquaculture industry provides an essential boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of direct and indirect jobs depend. endTok	77.28138544701773
startTok Now, as he said, in excess of 85 000 tons of Salmon is now produced in Scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than EUR 800 million annually. endTok	58.082082379232766
startTok Regrettably, although ISA was first detected in Scotland only two years ago, it has now spread to 29 farms directly and around 240 other farms are affected in some way or another. endTok	128.3978354795394
startTok Wild salmon, trout and eels have been found to carry the virus which now seems to be endemic even in the wider marine environment. endTok	44.21961008832352
startTok But I must say that despite the scare-mongering of the Greens, it has to be emphasised that ISA cannot under any circumstances be transmitted to humans, and I must repeat what Mr Hudghton said, that the virus cannot survive above 25o - which is human body temperature - it is a virus of a cold-water species. endTok	44.21726965385594
startTok It can, nevertheless, in the affected fish, lead to severe weight loss and early death in its advanced stages and it therefore has had a serious economic impact on the whole Scottish aquaculture sector costing the industry around EUR 60 to 70 million in losses arising from the mandatory premature culling and other eradication measures. endTok	95.75404158299885
startTok So this report, Mr President, provides an encouraging range of proposals for improving the way in which the authorities in the UK and elsewhere should respond to the disease. endTok	47.01003590361295
startTok By recommending the introduction of a method of containment and gradual culling, similar to the system used successfully in Norway, the rapporteur seeks to introduce a more flexible approach to the disease which will provide confidence, not least to the insurance sector who have hitherto shied clear of providing any form of cover due to the insistence on a policy of compulsory slaughter. endTok	60.25715788641154
startTok By recommending the research, development and ultimate use of vaccination to control and eradicate ISA, the rapporteur also provides comfort to the pharmaceutical industry who have hitherto had no incentive to invest in the development of a vaccine. endTok	52.15722598803788
startTok So I thoroughly recommend and hope that the Parliament will support this excellent report. endTok	59.4301783703644
startTok I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hudghton, also for this report. endTok	8.680727984725179
startTok Scottish salmon farming is the biggest in the European Union and accommodates 90% of the British aquacultural industry. endTok	32.260046297349476
startTok The industry is located in some of Europe' s most peripheral communities providing an economic lifeline to those communities. endTok	37.521806684219534
startTok In recent research it is estimated that the industry is worth EUR 800 million per annum and 6 500 jobs rely on its existence. endTok	41.401896255051035
startTok I believe that this report gives a clear method for dealing with Infectious Salmon Anaemia which is both practical, realistic and also achievable. endTok	36.54290825387941
startTok The example of Norway demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach. endTok	45.93827470717973
startTok As for the amendments, I oppose the amendments tabled by Mr Hudghton' s Green colleagues, that is numbers 7 to 13, not because I do not care about the risks to human health but because, according to scientific evidence, the virus does not survive beyond 25o Celsius and according to medical evidence, human beings at that temperature are dead. endTok	67.41810878335095
startTok There is a saying that the dead tell no tales and I am sure they do not eat fish but I do and I look forward to the implementation of this report. endTok	28.18429494402076
startTok I too would like to compliment Mr Hudghton on his report and to endorse his additions to the original proposal in relation both to the matter of compensation and encouragement of vaccine development. endTok	31.808581401662597
startTok I too agree that Amendments 7 to 13 are unfortunate, indeed Amendment 13 would not merely negate the intended effects of the proposal but actually would make the situation even more difficult than under current rules. endTok	130.34532601732073
startTok This is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming. endTok	42.03025560355188
startTok Mr Hudghton has already referred to the final report of the UK joint government industry working group on ISA and the measures there are of relevance for fish farming wherever it happens, not just in farms affected by ISA. endTok	72.66276407073758
startTok Secondly, looking forward to the motion for a resolution on the Katiforis report later this evening, paragraph 28 is of particular importance. endTok	46.62140874179306
startTok This calls on the Commission and Member States to step up the adoption of measures to combat the possible negative effects of aquaculture on the marine environment. endTok	34.093332884918
startTok Thirdly, referring to the earlier discussion on the collection of fisheries data, I very much hope that the Commission will engage in projects and studies looking at aquaculture in the environmental context but I believe that is the way forward in relation to the environment, not the way that is suggested in Amendments 7 to 13, and I hope honourable Members will reject them. endTok	46.647181383261966
startTok Mr President, I do not agree with this chorus of satisfaction expressed by my colleagues, who are delighted about the relaxing of a directive that respects the principle of precaution and which takes measures to protect consumers' health. endTok	28.02997195024556
startTok This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon, causing death. endTok	61.070479496062696
startTok It spreads very easily through mucus in saline water, etc. Under the 1993 directive, not only the diseased fish can be culled but also the farmed fish where individuals are affected, exactly like the case when one cow is sick in a herd and the whole herd is culled according to the principle of precaution. endTok	52.878475138772245
startTok What we currently propose is to relax this directive, so that we do not cull all the fish, but only the fish that are found to be diseased. endTok	43.92935431587186
startTok For the others, well, we would have time to see what would happen, according to local circumstances. endTok	91.89766850985373
startTok I think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way. endTok	16.13138455221066
startTok I would particularly draw my colleagues' attention to this fact as we cannot make do with saying that a temperature of 27º has every advantage for the human race and that, consequently, there is no risk to men. endTok	60.17836649890957
startTok What about women? endTok	329.75166595152024
startTok Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard. endTok	58.37408958560859
startTok There is also a risk to the environment, because we know that there is an incubation period in salmon and that, consequently, if they are eaten, they can be carriers of this virus and present a risk. endTok	33.817444602377165
startTok There is another risk to the environment as well, because this disease is transmitted to wild fish, as we have seen. endTok	29.683664171959137
startTok For this reason, together with my colleague, Patricia McKenna, we have tabled amendments against the proposals made by the Commission. endTok	20.15187485442649
startTok Mr Pietrasanta explained why we support some aspects of the Commission' s proposal, in particular support for development of a vaccine and compensation for farmers who are forced to slaughter their fish, but were not at all happy with the idea of changes to the slaughter policy. endTok	38.674997385504035
startTok Now people have said here that Norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of ISA and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the Norwegian approach, but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the Norwegian policy and that of the Community. endTok	35.05892442706722
startTok This is a Community policy which will effect Ireland as well - where I am from - should similar unfortunate events occur. endTok	105.30921031785896
startTok There are other differences that exist in the policy for inspections of disease, fallowing periods, restriction on movement of contaminated fish and materials and others. Before we jump to copy the slaughter policy of the Norwegians, we should try these other things first to see if we can mitigate the disaster. endTok	52.79655396941625
startTok And people have spoken in the past about BSE. endTok	50.86031078044166
startTok For many years the Greens were calling for the BSE issue to be addressed. endTok	47.15776568813788
startTok Had it been at that time, you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the EU a huge amount of money. endTok	52.168941310673326
startTok So it also has to do with environmental protection. endTok	38.59357101633469
startTok The protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health. endTok	31.57764899876671
startTok I would like to thank Mr Hudghton for his excellent report on ISA and for broadly supporting the measures proposed by the Commission and also for the contributions from each of the speakers this evening. endTok	16.055397469855656
startTok The Commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms. endTok	41.546164647167146
startTok However, this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating ISA. endTok	69.87693146530404
startTok Nor can it be done, if the proposal involves a threat to public health. endTok	26.723853465523142
startTok The environmental implications must also be taken very seriously. endTok	28.336386717494626
startTok I am advised that ISA is considered non-pathogenic for humans and mammals. endTok	27.740352883432205
startTok The disease exists since 1984 and there is no report of it affecting human health or mammals. endTok	62.30774900559657
startTok The virus harms cold-blooded animals. endTok	39.52889778287982
startTok It does not replicate at temperatures above 25º centigrade and would, if present in fish for human consumption, be inactivated when ingested. endTok	64.08171789650994
startTok In no way, however, can diseased fish be used for human consumption. endTok	39.273513949808866
startTok As an extra precaution, I am validating this advice to our scientific committee. endTok	47.3999813721633
startTok During the debate, a number of important issues linked to our disease-control strategy have been raised including compensation. endTok	106.49570424306337
startTok I deeply regret the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry. endTok	31.397176783668517
startTok You may know that with effect from 15 January 2000, under the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance, Member States may encourage eradication of diseases in aquaculture. endTok	49.503828910505945
startTok The Commission' s services are drawing up implementing rules in order to ensure the practical application of this instrument. endTok	38.10505703631875
startTok Council Decision 90/424 constitutes another instrument for Community financial support in case of disease outbreaks. endTok	114.36631493218856
startTok I must emphasise, however, that there are serious constraints. endTok	24.57291690062783
startTok Budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set. endTok	57.42613074753228
startTok So further thought is necessary. endTok	117.75421285200628
startTok I regret therefore that I am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through Decision 90/424. endTok	36.04606200647993
startTok This is in particular the case for Amendments Nos 3 and 5. endTok	18.92542882565664
startTok I agree, however, with the statement in Amendment No 2 saying that no compensation has been made payable to salmon farmers. endTok	33.62686522792827
startTok I am not able to comment on the availability of commercial insurance. endTok	17.904749850263194
startTok The Commission included in its proposal a possibility for vaccination of salmon. endTok	63.56065870948686
startTok The intention of this proposal is to introduce a tool for combating the disease in emergency situations. endTok	40.150219476822684
startTok I believe a vaccine should not be used for preventative purposes as suggested in Amendment No 4. endTok	25.700354449884596
startTok Experience in other areas has shown that preventative vaccination has the adverse affect of creating healthy virus carriers. endTok	53.53537372707421
startTok Those could perpetuate an infection. endTok	76.58927910939558
startTok I therefore am not able to accept Amendment No 4. endTok	12.916690561829645
startTok You also referred to the need for further scientific research on the nature of the disease. endTok	25.742306483574843
startTok I agree that such research is needed and I understand this is at present being organised in the United Kingdom. endTok	28.686194725323816
startTok I will follow very closely the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals. endTok	81.98732913040318
startTok It must be further examined whether and how scientific research in other parts of the Community must be organised. endTok	35.215035320044194
startTok In this context I am happy to partly accept Amendment No 1, taking into account, however, that scientific investigations are not done by the Commission but that the Commission relies on results of investigations carried out in the Member States. endTok	26.277993306590677
startTok I also can partly accept the part of Amendment No 6 saying that Directive 93/53 should be amended as a result of scientific and technical evidence. endTok	31.711634602617636
startTok As I pointed out earlier, the available scientific evidence is that ISA is not a threat to health. endTok	32.72320812218567
startTok I can therefore agree to Amendment No 10 with the proviso that the words, and I quote, "of the highest possible standard" are replaced by "are safe" . endTok	51.056657789542115
startTok With regard to the environmental impact, it is a well-known phenomenon that while stocks have fallen during the last decades several reasons have been advanced to explain these reductions: pollution, over-fishing, changes in climate, etc. It cannot at present be excluded that ISA has an impact on wild stock. endTok	86.53540582506564
startTok Fish escapes from aquaculture premises have been reported in the past and the virus has been found in wild stocks. endTok	39.734496653578745
startTok In this context, a number of scientific questions that can only be resolved through further research remain open. endTok	79.64081877550878
startTok It is for that reason that a careful approach towards the control of ISA is needed. endTok	39.56987755531205
startTok Diseased fish should not remain in the farms and I am prepared to look into the matter so as to avoid unnecessary shedding of a virus into the environment. endTok	46.083812084484336
startTok For that purpose, I propose to amend our initial proposal to provide that rural programmes established by the competent authority must be approved by the Commission. This is to avoid excessive withdrawal periods. endTok	55.406561677099134
startTok I also propose to provide that the withdrawal of fish displaying clinical signs of disease should be immediate. endTok	32.60927409243552
startTok The procedures for setting additional control measures that already exist in Community legislation will be used to establish withdrawal schemes based on the state of health of the fish in order to minimise a possible environmental impact. endTok	54.73226160105246
startTok Bearing this in mind, I can agree to accept Amendment Nos 7 and 8 with a minor change to the latter. endTok	64.68485241895674
startTok I am also very sympathetic towards Amendment No 9, but I believe that it can be better formulated so as to join, at the same time, environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies. endTok	42.23650695226153
startTok I do not feel in a position to accept Amendments Nos 12 and 13. endTok	16.257567344599607
startTok It is my feeling that these amendments aim to achieve a zero risk. endTok	45.44985457952552
startTok I believe this objective is very difficult to achieve without closing down the fish farming sector concerned. endTok	44.05044880083476
startTok I look forward to Parliament' s own views on these amendments and will take careful note if you believe that such an approach is the best way forward. endTok	30.232519277500742
startTok I can partly accept Amendment No 11. endTok	19.60110023464037
startTok Finally, I would like to emphasise that we continue to strive to maintain a high level of health protection in accordance with our obligations under the Treaty. endTok	21.490110643994736
startTok I believe that measures that are proportionate to that objective is the way forward. endTok	32.35846907887527
startTok We remain committed to eradicating the disease, an objective that will be beneficial for both the environment and the salmon-farming sector. endTok	45.24746577773969
startTok I hope that in accepting our proposal the European Parliament acknowledges our commitment and I would be very grateful for that. endTok	24.505553024779548
startTok Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne. endTok	8.466647524611782
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. endTok	3.2854916501347113
startTok Protection of juvenile marine organisms endTok	90.27413717421359
startTok The next item is the report A5-0035/2000 by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 1626/94 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean and for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (COM(1999) 552 - C5-0040/2000 - 1999/0222(CNS)). endTok	12.837135435359555
startTok The proposal before us as outlined in the introduction is a very important one. endTok	32.16857172551913
startTok By now, my colleagues in the Fisheries Committee and indeed in the Parliament will be well aware of our commitment to technical conservation measures which are based on sound technical advice. endTok	54.52948839111754
startTok The body charged with giving this advice based on sound scientific data is the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna. endTok	51.81892016678863
startTok This intergovernmental fishery organisation of which the European Union is a member is responsible for the conservation of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic and the adjacent seas including the Mediterranean. endTok	41.39800727109025
startTok This body was established back in March 1969 and is formally obliged to meet biannually, however the norm is that it meets annually and takes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice. endTok	60.192342723600945
startTok The body then makes recommendations with a view to maintaining stocks. endTok	94.16829208006273
startTok This body has four standing committees comprised of national experts dealing with research and statistics, finances and administration, compliance and conservation and management measures. endTok	104.5376796161369
startTok They have also four panels dealing with tropical tuna, with temperate tuna, the north and temperate tuna south and other species. endTok	67.76836190994129
startTok These panels are powered to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention. endTok	45.022303184782125
startTok Proposals made by the panels are then presented to the Commission and the Commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties. endTok	44.12713080589151
startTok These conditions are binding, however contracting parties may lodge objections within a six-month period. endTok	91.21099851109217
startTok The European Union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in Community law. endTok	32.668633134971
startTok At a ICCAT meeting in November 1998 in Santiago de Compostela, changes were recommended to the rules relating to the landing of the minimum size of bluefin tuna. endTok	30.843939983876645
startTok ICCAT also made recommendations in 1974, 1994 and 1996. endTok	81.78194917885162
startTok As of now, it is illegal to land or sell bluefin of zero age and that of course is - in weight terms - less than 1.8 kilos. endTok	94.99179973590141
startTok At its recent meeting in November 1998, the ICCAT standing committee on research and statistics was asked to perform a new assessment of the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna populations. endTok	40.440074393375916
startTok The information provided would then assist the organisation in considering developing and improving stock rebuilding plans. endTok	132.07279308309705
startTok It was agreed that the SCRS should present a study at the 1998 meeting. It was intended that this meeting be presented with various possible recovery options with a view to maximising sustainable yields by taking into account alternatives or possible levels of recruitment and mixing of stocks. endTok	65.83574159073947
startTok It was intended that the study should indicate monthly closures to purse seine, in order that the closures would be effective for the conservation of bluefin stock. endTok	34.21832555059011
startTok Following all of the research, the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the Mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 August to 31 August. endTok	69.32977276924561
startTok It is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations. endTok	36.24891744571254
startTok Bluefin tuna is the world' s most expensive fish fetching up to EUR 90 000 per ton at the auctions in Tokyo and, of course, the indication of the importance of the Mediterranean tuna is that it accounts for 70 percent of global landings in the region of 30 000 tons. endTok	36.793542748675016
startTok 80 percent of it was landed by purse seine. endTok	34.38664382720086
startTok The Mediterranean is an important spawning area for bluefin tuna so therefore it is important that the necessary measures be taken to enhance the protection of juveniles. endTok	35.554224740057016
startTok The minimum size must be respected and technical measures must be implemented if we are to eliminate the zero age. endTok	34.747475045099506
startTok The measures agreed in November 1998 are binding since 21 June, I repeat 21 June 1999, months before the communication was forwarded to the Parliament' s Fisheries Committee and 9 months almost to the date. endTok	91.22248133127277
startTok Now I believe, Commissioner, this is not good enough and that in the future we must learn and that reports must be submitted to the Parliament' s Fisheries Committee before decisions are taken, otherwise then we are nothing further than a rubber stamp and I know that is not the intention of the Commission or the Commissioner but let us learn from mistakes of the past. endTok	39.24317845345272
startTok Mr President, this proposal aims to incorporate into Community law an ICCAT recommendation from 1998 which should have been binding from June 1999, but which only reached this House at the end of last year. endTok	64.39654891094003
startTok The Commission' s legislative delay on certain issues should not surprise us, but for the fact that this is a recommendation from one of the most important international fisheries organisations on the protection of such a threatened resource as tuna. endTok	33.20003993543895
startTok The Mediterranean, particularly in some zones, is an extremely important spawning area for the bluefin tuna which is of enormous commercial value. endTok	42.096485051931396
startTok This is why ICCAT recommended this closed zone in the Adriatic and toughened the conditions for catching zero-age fish. endTok	59.37180137610012
startTok As rightly said by the rapporteur, both measures are totally and fully justified which is why we have no alternative but to ask for their approval. endTok	71.50564118638049
startTok However, I also agree with Mr Gallagher who felt bound to indicate his frustration at the tardiness of the Commission in getting into gear and transforming the recommendations into Community law. endTok	33.29302671660788
startTok We are, for example, still waiting for the proposal for a regulation on banning the import of bluefin tuna from Honduras and Belize. The recommendation for this dates from 1996. endTok	33.61158778389523
startTok Apparently, according to my information, the Fisheries Directorate-General sent a note last January to the Trade Directorate-General which is still on the preparatory work. endTok	103.86640508590979
startTok Four years to apply this ban on imports from countries known to favour flags of convenience is absolutely unacceptable. endTok	101.77399033929964
startTok We have listened to the Commission' s explanations about the long internal process involved in transposing legislation. This has simply left us with an image of an exasperating bureaucracy. endTok	59.43020670888853
startTok Yet I have my doubts about the only proposal currently on the table to improve this process which would involve doing away with the Council and Parliament procedure. endTok	54.424192349775076
startTok It is clear that we must find a solution to this problem, either at the time of the Commission report on regional fisheries organisations or, if possible, before then. endTok	46.669040358239485
startTok I do not suppose that anybody in this House would object to the principle of protecting juveniles of marine organisms. endTok	24.790852381392376
startTok Indeed, it is often stated that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy shall be to protect and conserve living marine aquatic resources. endTok	43.16175513640463
startTok All laudable stuff. endTok	146.93645992936754
startTok There can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance. endTok	30.190957744593966
startTok As a king sport fisherman myself, I would love to see the days of the 1930s come back when anglers from the port of Scarborough in Yorkshire caught bluefin tuna weighing up to 830 pounds. endTok	41.74191879725977
startTok I do not know what the metric equivalent is. endTok	21.212815081115142
startTok So I support the findings of ICCAT and I support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues. endTok	51.451138057298984
startTok My concern though with this debate is that we are fiddling whilst Rome burns. endTok	67.81196815759395
startTok The common fisheries policy is not working. endTok	17.249342533966843
startTok For all of the high-minded talk about conservation, the reality is that the quota system is directly leading to an environmental disaster. endTok	48.39189320847035
startTok In mixed fisheries, you cannot discriminate. endTok	130.99813749029576
startTok The sheer volume of fish that are thrown back dead also means that any improvement in fisheries data is meaningless. endTok	34.96654897702916
startTok From a UK perspective there is also a deep-seated political objection to the CFP. endTok	37.367753422177444
startTok Many people now feel if this is federalism you can keep it. endTok	102.43711477556275
startTok Let me illustrate this with a topical example. endTok	47.93455144091402
startTok In February, Commission Regulation 394/2000 designed to protect Irish Sea cod stocks was issued. endTok	178.85320742895655
startTok It means that in Fleetwood, 30 inshore boats are tied up until the end of April. endTok	40.84937648618668
startTok The scientists and the fishermen both agree that something has to be done. endTok	42.49529921617498
startTok However, more than a dozen large Belgian beam trawlers have been granted a derogation from this regulation so the vessels that caused the very problem in the first place are carrying on fishing whilst it is a criminal offence for the UK fleet to do so. endTok	62.583507760641346
startTok The CFP does not assist in conservation and is angering the British public to the point where we demand to re-establish control over our own territorial waters. endTok	69.06754995288506
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Gallagher' s report on the fourth amendment of the Regulation on technical measures was not amended in our committee. It was actually approved unanimously for which I congratulate the rapporteur. endTok	27.670249189704226
startTok This also shows that our committee is in total agreement when it comes to supporting measures which aim to protect species, such as tuna in this case. endTok	45.35555935480441
startTok These decisions must be defended by the Commission in ICCAT. This is why our committee asked to be consulted in advance and to be represented at the meetings as an observer in order to ensure greater and better control and to reinforce the European Parliament' s role. endTok	34.715627678485646
startTok Mr Fischler, I am delighted that the Commission responded favourably to our request in the last and constructive debate which we had on this issue and has asked to attend our next meeting this month to inform us about the future preparatory ICCAT meeting. endTok	38.96978038183361
startTok Our rapporteur' s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded. endTok	59.56099102988328
startTok I must highlight the part of the report which states that, in 1975, with regard to the size of bluefin tuna, a minimum limit of 6.4 kg with a 15% tolerance in the number of fish was recommended for the entire Atlantic. endTok	38.14426968834537
startTok However, according to the SCRS study, the regulation establishing the 6.4 kg minimum has been poorly enforced in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean fisheries. endTok	54.14949088132493
startTok The WWF reports that, according to Italian, French and Spanish customs authorities, illegal bluefin fishing and landings of small fish are on the increase. endTok	75.28841380219382
startTok I cannot and do not want to go any further as we are pushed for time. endTok	43.56751400159057
startTok However, I must again congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Gallagher. endTok	22.964203721323702
startTok Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler. endTok	3.9974592804328517
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. endTok	3.285491258473609
startTok Fishing and the environment (Bergen 13-14 March 1997): 2nd report endTok	107.1211255703745
startTok The next item is the report (A5-0016/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the second report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of the "statement of conclusions from the intermediate ministerial meeting on the integration of fisheries and environmental issues, 13-14 March in Bergen" (COM(1999) 270 - C5-0156/1999 - 1999/2150 (COS)). endTok	9.750985015266263
startTok Mr President, Mr Fischler, my report concerns the vital integration of environmental and fisheries issues, as discussed at the ministerial meeting in Bergen. endTok	52.27758866812115
startTok This integration has always been a priority for me as we would be doing the fisheries and fishermen of the future a disservice if we did not emphasise the need for conservation of resources and responsible fisheries in general. endTok	60.9143305646798
startTok To fail in this respect would mean food for today but hunger for tomorrow, not just for our fishermen and the people of Europe but, more seriously, for humanity as a whole. endTok	67.57246443019233
startTok The common fisheries policy is theoretically very demanding and very strict in this respect, perhaps more so than most people, both Europeans and non-Europeans, would believe. endTok	82.0878638539707
startTok I have therefore asked the European Commission to produce a publication which lists all the measures of the common fisheries policy aimed at conserving and protecting resources. This will serve to publicise our protectionist actions. endTok	32.61396254749578
startTok We have also asked Parliament' s own DG IV to prepare a systematic study of these measures for the Committee on Fisheries. endTok	31.561511594639033
startTok The revision of the common fisheries policy in 2002 is the biggest time-limited challenge facing us. We must completely overhaul, modernise or, if you prefer, update this policy in its entirety. endTok	52.0574664421625
startTok I would stress that the whole of the CFP must be revised, particularly the part on the protection of fish stocks. endTok	23.72135357119807
startTok This is the basis of my request to the European Commission and the services of this House. endTok	16.490161641251873
startTok I do not believe that the state of stocks and the current scandalous system of discards are a good example of the policy' s effectiveness which must therefore, in my opinion, be significantly improved. endTok	32.72063362260664
startTok I do not want to and cannot go into too much detail, Mr President, given the time constraints and also the interpreters' fees. endTok	53.526873692666626
startTok However, I will just remind you that the meeting in Bergen showed very significantly that a proper policy on the sea must be created. endTok	39.38067573131628
startTok The President-in-Office informed our committee that the current Portuguese presidency intended the CFP to be regarded as a policy for ensuring the sustainability of our resources. This must be our objective in Europe and throughout the world. endTok	41.550077455538485
startTok In this respect, important Community initiatives arose from Bergen which have always been supported by our committee. These are aimed at re-establishing the breeding biomass, reducing and adapting fishing effort to resources, protecting juveniles, species and their habitats and adopting technical measures aimed at selective and responsible fisheries. endTok	81.15294643519522
startTok These initiatives, together with effective systems of control, are the key aspects for the future of fisheries. endTok	69.86597007230257
startTok However, we do not have to resort to extreme solutions, as Mr Katiforis initially suggested in his draft report. endTok	44.09192146349343
startTok I am referring to this now because I will not have time to speak later on. endTok	25.993142820908478
startTok I must point out in this respect that it was the numerous amendments tabled and approved in our committee and the flexibility shown by Mr Katiforis which enabled his report to be approved by our committee. endTok	40.471894758861104
startTok Coincidence or fate has worked to bring together in this part-session both my report and Mr Katiforis' s report on fisheries and the environment. The oral question from our committee on the extremely serious consequences for fisheries of the accident involving the tanker Erika will also be considered tomorrow. endTok	50.78225476941397
startTok Maritime transport, industrial and urban pollution and waste also have negative effects on fisheries whose problems do not just come from overfishing. endTok	115.24961637536354
startTok Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler. endTok	3.997459756967161
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. endTok	3.2854916501347113
startTok Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment endTok	32.133364601281585
startTok The next item is the report A5-0017/2000 by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament: Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment (COM(1999) 363 - C5-0176/1999 - 1999/2155 (COS)). endTok	5.708117236348721
startTok The problems for resource management and environmental protection in the fishery sector have been considered by this House many times in the past. endTok	35.83407955756032
startTok This particular communication from the Commission forms part of the Commission' s overall strategy of improving the integration of environmental considerations into other Community policies. endTok	47.89251305090844
startTok The overall strategy of the Commission is to direct fisheries activities towards both economically and environmentally sustainable levels through management of the scarce resource in such a manner as to prevent its exhaustion through over-exploitation and/or environmental degradation. endTok	74.83606998439961
startTok The alternative to successful management is the economic decline of the fisheries industry as stocks dwindle and demand for fish products is increasingly met by imports. endTok	77.89583059333344
startTok I understand I have been described in a Spanish newspaper as an enemy of the fishing industry because I have said such things. endTok	32.743920706933366
startTok Of course, I am only an enemy of the fishing industry as much as anybody who recommends to some people not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting. endTok	50.41083186521033
startTok This is an unwise policy. endTok	15.40700128241984
startTok In particular, the communication calls for control of fisheries pressure to benefit commercial stocks and marine aqua systems, improved measures for nature conservation in the marine environment, in the graded management of coastal areas, improved training, information transparency and a greater contribution from scientific research to fisheries management. endTok	71.63491562184612
startTok All of the above priorities will be pursued equally at both the Community level and in the various international fora in which the Community participates. endTok	48.63486998766373
startTok They should also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements which the Community negotiates. endTok	35.55958247355392
startTok Whilst the communication reveals the Commission' s worthy intentions in this field, it is also revealing as to what activity is lacking and where management and control improvements can be made. endTok	64.40305905347266
startTok One can quote from the communication. endTok	76.0865501091848
startTok Over-exploitation is so severe in Community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to 40 percent. endTok	110.35300126108318
startTok That appeared in the communication published last July. endTok	72.1169996242504
startTok Since then, the Fisheries Council meeting of 16 December decided on drastic reductions in the total allowable catches for certain species such as cod and anchovy which were in the region of 25 percent for cod and 43 percent for anchovy for the year 2000. endTok	70.18357915081117
startTok Furthermore, the Commission adopted an emergency regulation for a recovery plan for Irish Sea cod, effectively calling a halt to cod fishing in the Irish Sea between 14 February and 13 April due to the crisis in the species. endTok	89.25632607892508
startTok These are examples of the fishery sector facing severe problems due to over-exploitation. endTok	80.38909160682483
startTok What can be done to alleviate the damage done to fishing communities? endTok	37.56583735995482
startTok The first consideration must be to recognise that Community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced. endTok	71.0206673683103
startTok Secondly, the principles of such Community legislation should also be extended to international agreements to which the Community is a party. endTok	43.232230943070746
startTok Thirdly, the European Union should undertake to enhance its monitoring and prevention of extensive pollution prevalent in Community waters and which is harmful to marine life including fishery resources. endTok	56.970027228850306
startTok More controls would be placed to prevent oil spillages such as that of the Erika in the Bay of Biscay and also deliberate dumping of waste oils. endTok	47.30546345919343
startTok Recognition should also be given to the pressures which the delicate marine aqua system faces from urbanisation of coastal areas. endTok	57.688123864186686
startTok Such pressures are greatest in Europe. endTok	59.415840810327346
startTok In this context one can also mention the problems of discards of unwanted catches, fishing gear which destroys the seabed and the destruction of natural habitats by over intensive aquacultures. endTok	34.541918795893785
startTok A quota management system such as that existing in New Zealand since 1986 is one possible alternative. endTok	147.36082324089605
startTok Under this system, and given the total allowable catch for a species, a market is created for individual quotas for fishing rights within a certain area which the rightholders can trade amongst themselves, fish themselves or lease the rights to other fishermen for a certain time. endTok	104.95548624365045
startTok The property right that has been created in such a system is the right to fish - not the fish themselves. endTok	39.59834131685987
startTok Such a market organisation can reap better long-term prospects for the fishing industry. endTok	59.13133744449115
startTok At present dear colleagues, we can never be fully informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea, nor about the multitude of factors which affect the stock of resources in this aqua system. endTok	48.197990780159856
startTok However, we should never blind ourselves to scientific research, we should never cease to gather information, we should never cease to explore improvements in existing systems and, if necessary, we should at least consider policy changes. endTok	79.85848861267549
startTok The fishery sectors in Europe face serious problems and I am a great supporter of the fishery sector. endTok	45.58068241155181
startTok I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to find the information, the political will to provide genuine long-term solutions for fishing communities and not depend upon short-termism. endTok	61.55676955552751
startTok I recommend the report to the House. endTok	30.519176584574147
startTok The Environment Committee is generally pleased with the Commission' s communication and we are also pleased that the Fisheries Committee adopted all our amendments. endTok	40.65362061965744
startTok It is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide-ranging and pervasive than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by-catch. endTok	84.78189971109063
startTok We welcome the intention of the Commission to integrate environmental protection into other policies of the EU including the common fisheries policy. endTok	32.89514225483155
startTok After all, the treaties have stipulated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into Community policies. endTok	50.04751864919197
startTok But as has been pointed out, the adoption of a rigorous definition of the precautionary principle is crucial. This is because it is all very easy to pay lip service to the idea and then to continue with business as usual. endTok	43.38942508328636
startTok The UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard. endTok	132.71672536934895
startTok One aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control. endTok	51.34855417948853
startTok All the good policies and regulations in the world will not lead to conservation without an effective system to ensure that the rules are respected. endTok	45.932273108329085
startTok Control is a Member State competence and the Council has recently adopted a list of serious infringements aimed at coordinating to some extent the severity with which similar violations are viewed in different countries. endTok	56.77108981663745
startTok This is a good step forward, but as the Commission and the Fisheries Committee continually point out, much improvement is needed in the control programmes of all Member States. endTok	45.32579925976799
startTok I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report. endTok	4.263765776044514
startTok Mr President, fishing is an extremely important economic activity which involves major investment. Most of its jobs are provided under fairly tough conditions throughout entire Community regions. endTok	119.46236958163928
startTok However, some people' s view of the fisheries sector can be extremely simplistic, ranging from mere folklore to the insult of regarding fishermen as insensitive pirates and predators. endTok	33.44783683455575
startTok I regret to say that this report, due to its link with the environment, seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular misconceptions. endTok	48.21847262115143
startTok If Mr Katiforis' s report had been approved in its initial wording, none of the members of the Committee on Fisheries could have gone into any fishing region again without fear of being lynched. endTok	45.21622420590039
startTok The relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious. endTok	34.08108545991728
startTok Yet it is very wide-ranging and involves many other factors including pollution and maritime transport. endTok	57.484540803323775
startTok To blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong. endTok	149.9350811133595
startTok Our committee avoided embarrassing itself by making a series of amendments of which I tabled 14, many of which were accepted by the rapporteur for which I thank him sincerely. endTok	61.02821091195667
startTok Just when we thought the discussions had ended, a number of diverse amendments have been tabled in plenary which I ask you to vote against unreservedly. endTok	60.99315485934125
startTok According to these, for example, the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea. endTok	106.06326939339115
startTok Others, like Amendment No 4, which request financing for biological closures, also demonstrate a lack of understanding of fisheries regulations by requesting measures which are already in force, although admittedly there is room for improvement in these. endTok	109.97326317140681
startTok I therefore ask you to reject the four amendments tabled so that we can close this chapter on fisheries and the environment with the thought which came up in the committee' s debate. These two areas are closely related and they suffer the effects of the same environmental attacks. endTok	51.50279538465205
startTok As I have said many times before, the fisheries sector is more a victim than the cause of damage to the marine ecosystem and tomorrow we will be able to confirm this in the debate on the Erika. endTok	29.977944026532047
startTok Mr President, Mr Katiforis' s report has the virtue of having brought life, debate and controversy to a communication in which the European Commission limits itself to listing a series of good intentions, although recognising its inability to put these into practice. endTok	49.64391153659478
startTok Mr Katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which, in his opinion, could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea. endTok	26.489790273636498
startTok Yet I must say that I disagree with many of his proposals because I am with those who believe that it is not just resources which are important in the fisheries sector but also the human beings who have been carrying out this activity for centuries. endTok	32.33904889076363
startTok I agree with the rapporteur that the European fisheries and environmental policies should be better coordinated. endTok	20.321257182327543
startTok However, what we are basically missing is the political courage and determination of the Commission and the Member States to take decisions and apply the current regulations. endTok	44.02541808524959
startTok Maritime transport, employment and energy should be integrated together with fisheries and the environment. endTok	76.95495371045165
startTok As for the Structural Funds, certain examples could be mentioned but I will leave this for another day. endTok	67.89796978426715
startTok The European Parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries. endTok	27.959849617929844
startTok The Commission and Member States should be meticulous in respecting the TACs and the quotas fixed in accordance with objective scientific criteria. The same yardstick should be used for everyone. endTok	44.14467234483519
startTok As Mr Katiforis says, discards are a waste of resources which we cannot accept. endTok	45.622714690117235
startTok Twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back. endTok	56.86046589070696
startTok The fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear. endTok	79.49819597175502
startTok This House has already indicated its opposition to driftnets and yet it is evident that certain countries are not only not respecting the undertaking to eliminate these nets but are increasing the number of vessels using these or simply not providing data given the passiveness of the national and Community authorities. endTok	59.08317007699136
startTok We socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector. endTok	30.79199997709019
startTok It is therefore essential that the Commission launches an information campaign on the CFP with this message. endTok	22.524922311702806
startTok Without a common fisheries policy there can only be lack of control, damage to the environment and an unsustainable economic activity. endTok	33.93318079096757
startTok Mr President, I very much appreciate this report by Mr Katiforis on fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment. endTok	13.452394163868155
startTok Let us not forget that fish are at the very basis of our food chain and that the first 'environmental' disaster, Minamata disease, occurred in 1958 in Japan owing to the fact that fish were polluted by mercury. endTok	35.095169751335085
startTok We should therefore very carefully monitor pollution from industrial activity, but also from domestic activity. endTok	146.32592634445456
startTok I do not believe that ejecting emissions at sea, and particularly in a closed environment like the Mediterranean, when we want to clean up purification plants, is a good way to clean up water. endTok	60.778169079364964
startTok We should pay particular attention to telluric pollution, to development, to the urbanisation of coastal areas, etc. But we should also think about restoring the environment and, for example, solving the problems associated with caulerpa taxifolia, and the areas of posidonia that are disappearing and which must therefore be protected. endTok	31.234263586779516
startTok They say that if you want something done, it is best to do it yourself and so the users of the sea, the fishermen, must be very attentive. endTok	65.72551921241498
startTok It will certainly be necessary to reduce the amount of fish caught and the elimination of the surplus capacity between 30 and 40%, as proposed by the Commission, has been very greatly watered down by the Council, to between 5 and 10%. endTok	44.857567692632834
startTok It will also be necessary to undertake selective fishing and, together with my colleague, Nol Mamre, who is also a former Member of the European Parliament, we would request a moratorium on the use of deep-sea trawlers in Community waters in the Bay of Biscay, to the south of the 47th parallel north, because we have had enough of seeing dolphins being washed up and dying on our beaches, particularly at the moment. endTok	39.65828966916146
startTok So we must practise selective fishing. endTok	66.86207733144961
startTok Aquaculture should also be monitored. endTok	58.102386871967234
startTok Read Mr Katiforis' s report again, in which he says that in Scotland, for example, 17 000 salmon are infected by the disease that I just mentioned, and impact upon the environment. endTok	49.53543464289113
startTok Let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment. endTok	81.20803058299002
startTok The Council of Europe is coming before the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 22 March to speak about the research work that must be undertaken, particularly in the marine environment and, more precisely, the scientific and economic challenges of exploiting the oceans. endTok	60.46124738402916
startTok Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to come and take part in this discussion. endTok	18.245435304398704
startTok Mr President, the Katiforis report has been amended according to the proposals, notably, of the Europe for a Union of Nations Group, which were adopted in the Committee on Fisheries and, in my opinion, this version is an improvement on the original. endTok	31.576647697780903
startTok I would like to touch briefly on these amendments. endTok	12.042802956615446
startTok With regard to the installation of satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems, we feel that it is important for them to be installed on as many vessels as possible, although small vessels should not be compelled to carry them, of course, as investment and running costs would be disproportionately high compared to the value of the catches they make, and also in view of the fact that, in any case, satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems are not suitable or efficient for coastal fishing vessels. endTok	66.78225979207005
startTok We welcome the report' s rejection of the idea originally put forward by the rapporteur of creating a taxation system, as this would be impossible to implement and enforce for all the Member States. endTok	38.2131483897793
startTok Moreover, with regard to the protection of coastal areas, which are the main breeding and spawning grounds for many species of fish, we hope for tighter controls, which, in our opinion, should be accompanied by penal sanctions for throwing unwanted catches back into the sea. endTok	45.95551723738537
startTok In effect, this practice is responsible for a high death rate and is therefore incompatible with good fisheries management. endTok	72.90692419757505
startTok More specifically, with regard to fisheries management in the Mediterranean, we are all aware that fishing in the Mediterranean is not governed by provisions on TACs. endTok	31.675454898955785
startTok And just as well, in my view. endTok	56.600369336011894
startTok As you may be aware, in contrast with the cold Northern seas, the Mediterranean is a small, warm sea where there are very few, if any, schools of only one species of fish. endTok	103.55588786910197
startTok In our opinion, the possibility put forward in the explanatory statement of this report of setting TACs in the Mediterranean is therefore inappropriate. endTok	45.137154593344285
startTok Lastly, we would vote for the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left. endTok	14.141984361554158
startTok We do believe that it is extremely important to give financial support to conventional fishing and craft trades and to boost the income of fishermen during periods when moratoria on fishing are in force: in short, we must make it possible to carry on a major, responsible economic activity while still ensuring proper respect for the environment. endTok	58.73984046639406
startTok Mr President, first of all, I am pleased that the Katiforis report takes into consideration the multitude of factors responsible for the deterioration of the marine environment: pollution, unsupervised fishing, drilling platforms and pressure from the increasing use of coastal areas for urban development are potential sources of widescale damage to the environment in both coastal areas and offshore, and fishing is also a victim of this situation. endTok	35.67617703903104
startTok There is therefore a need for an in-depth analysis of the relationship between fishing and the environment. endTok	20.433650280093044
startTok The use of selective fishing gear which reduces incidental unwanted catches and limits the throwing of unwanted fish back into the sea is certainly essential, as is a reduction of the pressure from the fishing industry offshore, as well as in coastal waters. endTok	47.267774450767234
startTok A reduction in the fishing capacity and in pressure from the fishing industry on fish stocks is not necessarily compatible with maintaining an outdated fleet and would limit modernisation. endTok	100.2381836609829
startTok In addition to providing more appropriate conditions of safety and hygiene, the use of more modern vessels could also contribute to reducing certain major factors. endTok	88.45402364225396
startTok Moreover, it is important to uphold the concept that it is not possible to make a surface categorisation of entire fishing sections as more environmentally friendly: in reality, in some cases, small-scale fishing has less of an impact on the environment and natural resources. endTok	78.15552504008734
startTok I am also pleased that the report takes into consideration the possibility of starting a campaign for informing fishermen and consumers of the risks of exploiting fishing resources, and I also welcome the Commission' s request to propose the institution of a European award to be given to different categories of the industry and to all those who provide services and advice regarding responsible behaviour, in order to further the sustainable management of fish stocks and the conservation of marine life. endTok	47.834473934507876
startTok Mr President, as a member of the Verts/ALE Group, but also as a Member of this Parliament for Galicia, I propose to use this intervention to enlarge upon two issues. I shall, of course, be brief. endTok	36.0075297039096
startTok Firstly, fishery production and the conservation of marine life and resources are two sides of the same coin. endTok	57.51376810650885
startTok Shipowners and fishermen from the countries most active in fishing are more concerned than anyone about respecting their means of living, for without it, the future of this sector cannot be guaranteed. endTok	135.7551518474641
startTok Secondly, it is true that a policy of preserving the marine environment must be practised both in Community seas and in international waters or those belonging to third countries. endTok	39.08071600330282
startTok This particularly applies, however, to our own coastal waters. endTok	65.44190707195608
startTok Given this context, I would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago. endTok	29.119206455241
startTok I discovered that the EU is using ERDF resources to finance the construction of a wharf in Vilagarcia, in Galicia, for storing chemical and hydrocarbon products, on a site which will only employ three workers. This contravenes the EC environmental impact directive in relation to an estuary such as Arousa, where 26 000 people earn a living from the seafood industry. endTok	67.84369647403858
startTok Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report. endTok	14.544923619852822
startTok Conservation is something that I hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it. endTok	118.69327725486875
startTok A lot of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep. endTok	35.86778245810191
startTok It is all very well to talk about conservation and I agree with it totally. endTok	32.65584641349723
startTok But at the end of the day one has got to strike the balance between those who are dependent on their life and their livelihood from the sea and those who are making the laws which govern who may or may not fish and where, when and how they may fish in any particular waters within the European Union. endTok	56.69877629071198
startTok Commissioner Fischler, of course, knows me from a long time back and I have written to him on BSE and many other issues in agriculture but now that he is responsible for fisheries I am going to have to berate him on fisheries, along with his lusty colleagues, because one of the areas that has been most affected has been my region and the fishermen of Northern Ireland. endTok	58.30134659271301
startTok In actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any recompense, without any real negotiation or discussion. endTok	79.04837185439371
startTok It has been imposed upon them that they cannot fish for about an 11 to 12 week period. endTok	216.52624690645263
startTok Now we all accept that there is a problem in conservation and a problem of stocks, but what I am really saying to you Commissioner, and I have said this to you in the Fisheries Committee and I will say it to you again: There is a wide divide between Brussels and the working fishermen. endTok	49.188397759192384
startTok It does not matter whether you come from Galicia, it does not matter whether you are from Northern Ireland or whether you are from Scotland. endTok	81.96270322832045
startTok That chasm exists and we in Brussels have not been able to cross that divide. endTok	78.52384735674772
startTok And we have got to take on board the views of the fishermen. endTok	20.223739896543247
startTok We have got to take on board the concerns of the fishermen and we have got to work closely with them and I hope that you, as the Commissioner responsible for fisheries, will recognise that divide and will try and work as closely as you possibly can to ensure that all sides are brought together and their views are taken on board. endTok	39.83668522540354
startTok Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler. endTok	3.9974592804328517
startTok The debate is closed. endTok	3.77548916318001
startTok The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. endTok	3.2854920417958597
startTok Bankruptcy procedures endTok	2002.2187182157847
startTok The next item is the report A5-0039/2000 by Mr Lechner, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Finland, with a view to the adoption of a Council regulation on insolvency proceedings (9178/1999 - C5-0069/1999 - 1999/0806(CNS)). endTok	6.983250292116992
startTok Mr President, I think we all agree that a European legal area must be created. endTok	18.402851522902125
startTok We also all agree that there should be harmonisation in a field that is marked by the great disparity of our legal systems and, what is more, concepts. endTok	33.34590183192341
startTok The very word bankruptcy, the legal concept of bankruptcy, does not cover the same accounting concept in each of the Member States of the Union. endTok	39.27899200002961
startTok We therefore all agree on the established facts, and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction. endTok	42.36762972020994
startTok If I may, however, just make a few comments on the method. endTok	47.66328959354159
startTok When you observe - and you cannot fail to do so - the disparity in the legal systems and concepts, and the fact that we wish to improve coordination, I believe that there are three ways in which we can proceed. endTok	38.9387232597965
startTok The first is to establish equivalence, saying: in the final analysis, bankruptcy in France is the same thing as bankruptcy in England or in Germany. endTok	42.48427739004732
startTok The second way is to recreate a law ex nihilo, that is to say, to harmonise the systems and completely overhaul all the concepts and legal systems in each of the Member States. endTok	44.27814011458505
startTok That is not the route that has been taken. endTok	20.313511559402848
startTok The third route that has been taken is in the end to superimpose above the existing systems, which are not touched, a real embryo of Community law of collective procedures and procedures for companies in difficulty. endTok	66.0427889125011
startTok This is a good thing, moreover, and the result has probably exceeded what the authors had hoped for. endTok	67.80925204963042
startTok But at this stage I should like to make an observation, which is not technical, but more philosophical and taken from practice. endTok	47.6700970040768
startTok It is that bankruptcy is experienced within the European Union, in the majority of States, as an absolutely definitive event for the person it affects. endTok	64.70129443553499
startTok And I believe that it is our responsibility, in an ever more rapidly moving economy, where everyone must have a real opportunity, to give people the chance of running a commercial enterprise, and a second and a third chance, if necessary. endTok	94.24070344696308
startTok Today, in many Member States, that is not possible. endTok	27.870566105283217
startTok One of the reasons that explains the difference in competitiveness between the European area, for example and the United States, is precisely this ability of bouncing back that exists on the other side of the Atlantic and that we just do not have here. endTok	45.79734596029797
startTok I believe that since we have gone that far and we are continuing along that path, which is the route of creating a collective procedure for regulating this type of legal standard in the European Union, we should bear in mind that it should not become the allegorical figure of the guillotine. endTok	40.88122650560056
startTok Mr President, Commissioner, I believe, in fact, that it is more by luck than skill that there have not so far been any disasters due to the absence of the rules mentioned by the previous speakers. endTok	36.81968460618838
startTok When we deal with the positive side of the single market and create a common internal market, we must also deal with the darker side, namely bankruptcies. endTok	28.17920862074964
startTok I consider that we are experiencing an historic moment in this regard. endTok	25.108424333399313
startTok I congratulate the rapporteur for having so quickly progressed further with his report. endTok	42.64891902350846
startTok I am, moreover, proud that my own country has been involved in tabling this regulation which we now hope will swiftly be adopted by the Council. endTok	40.419070661515775
startTok I think it is an important step we are taking, even if each of the national systems is not especially influenced by it. endTok	37.97477490636617
startTok To the rapporteur' s regret, I must unfortunately point out that our Group cannot support Amendment No 3 because we consider that it restricts creditors' legal position and impairs their legal protection. endTok	64.98801829664896
startTok With regard to Amendment No 6, we tabled a similar amendment in the negotiations in committee. I am a little surprised that you in the Group of the Party of European Socialists did not support it then. endTok	32.273662938352615
startTok We shall now support your Amendment No 6, but I wonder why you did not support our own amendment in committee. endTok	46.67817632747946
startTok I also hope that we produce some insight in this context and that we shall be able to compare which procedures are quickest and best in the various countries. endTok	33.04673127282997
startTok . (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the Commission wishes to emphasise above all that the draft regulation being debated this evening is merely an amendment of the 1995 Convention on insolvency proceedings. endTok	32.943324536740256
startTok As you all know, this convention was the result of many years of discussion, which was often difficult and often laborious, and that for this very reason, it represents a compromise between unitary and territorial principles, that is to say, the structural principles of the different legal insolvency proceedings in each of our Member States. endTok	58.11111472119633
startTok Because we are aware that the developing global economic situation, and particularly the single market, can force businesses to resort more frequently to insolvency proceedings, which often take the form of cross-border proceedings, the Union itself is fully justified in equipping itself with the binding legal instruments it needs to ensure that insolvency proceedings are carried out according to a set of common structural principles, thus ensuring that they are carried out swiftly. endTok	68.43082646423589
startTok For better or for worse, the fact that businesses become insolvent will become an increasingly common occurrence in our daily economic life. endTok	169.0945250040511
startTok It will furthermore be a factor in renewing the very fabric of business, which must not be hindered by the existence of slow bureaucratic procedures or by obstacles that prolong the agony of businesses that are no longer viable. endTok	46.19990638371076
startTok This is why it is important to try to find a legal frame of reference which can adapt to the new requirements of a global economy. endTok	31.911081409808933
startTok It was not the Commission that presented the present proposal for a regulation but two Member States, Germany and Finland, by means of a joint initiative under the right of initiative which Member States share with the Commission on such issues. endTok	54.46691226312609
startTok The Commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the Convention. endTok	34.011771849394826
startTok As far back as 1981, the Commission had already stated its position in favour of clearly adopting the principle of unitary insolvency proceedings. endTok	53.744969324486966
startTok Furthermore, this view was accepted in the Commission' s proposals on a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of businesses. endTok	50.48944849612085
startTok The 1995 Convention, on the other hand, authorises the filing of secondary proceedings, thereby creating situations which are exceptions to the general rule that the Commission would like to see accepted. endTok	60.36304517392878
startTok Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission would therefore have preferred that a new text be adopted, one which would specifically enshrine the principle of unitary proceedings. endTok	36.568758692370054
startTok Nevertheless, I do not think that this is the time to call into question the agreement obtained in the 1995 Convention which was, moreover, based on a timescale for negotiations of approximately thirty years. endTok	51.59837949196706
startTok Consequently, the Commission has refrained from presenting an amendment. Instead, it has limited itself to focusing its opinions on institutional issues. endTok	63.00023198339654
startTok The Commission feels, for this reason too, that it should not present a modified proposal for amendments to the regulation, but I would nevertheless like to convey to you the Commission' s opinions on the amendments under discussion. endTok	40.45368107137116
startTok The Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Lechner. endTok	19.491664557400355
startTok On the other hand, it does not accept Amendment No 4. endTok	8.613864040919141
startTok Indeed, the Commission feels that Parliament should instead support Amendment No 4 by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which would allow the annexes to the regulation to be modified by the Commission, assisted by a regulatory committee, in accordance with the on-going procedure of Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC. endTok	38.1541928629858
startTok Therefore, with regard to the amendments proposed by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 3 and 4. On the other hand, it does not accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2, on the idea of "centre of the debtor' s main interests" . endTok	23.460222778122994
startTok With regard to the centre of main interests of a company or of a legal person, this idea is clearly defined in Article 3. endTok	68.02065707195986
startTok In all other cases that have not been specifically addressed, we feel that the reference made in Recital 13 should be sufficient. endTok	69.34236939696262

startTok Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I want to warmly thank Mr Fischler for being here today. endTok	12.5800516879084
startTok Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments. endTok	79.52947597140721
startTok He must have reconsidered and, in so doing, has, as usual, shown great respect for this House. I thank him for this. endTok	76.37909972981576
startTok On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker Erika. endTok	15.883657288656277
startTok There are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue. endTok	55.650026072731016
startTok Firstly, we must show the Commission, the Council and the Member States that this House cannot and will not forget about this serious incident. endTok	33.54212541759631
startTok Secondly, we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster, namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions. endTok	48.47742716947653
startTok The epilogue to this disaster must surely be the urgent adoption of measures to minimise the damage and to prevent this happening again in the future. endTok	40.873156915359516
startTok Enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event. endTok	146.48467765295524
startTok We must now get down to adopting measures, Commissioner. endTok	76.4853025221009
startTok Firstly, efficient controls are needed in Community waters and ports in order to ensure safety in maritime transport, particularly where oil and dangerous goods are involved. endTok	95.23525807578399
startTok The construction of these vessels, the use of double hulls, their age, their control by classification companies, insurance, the creation of databases containing all relevant information, Community cooperation and coordination, the reinforcement of control by inspectors and the liability of carriers and owners of cargoes are all issues which must be tackled. Who better than the European Commission to make serious proposals for European harmonisation in these areas? endTok	84.80822187759732
startTok Flags of convenience must also be specifically monitored and regulated in maritime transport, particularly as they do so much damage to the fisheries which we have taken to calling 'responsible fisheries' . endTok	66.81325144887548
startTok Access into Community waters of vessels flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards must be controlled. endTok	64.03574679472878
startTok We expect concrete action from the European Commission. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of Brittany and the Vendée are particularly important, well-developed and prestigious. endTok	42.370458159040005
startTok The European Commission must therefore publicise the damage caused and its assessment of this damage. It must also indicate all the specific measures, including political, economic, social and financial measures, which it intends to adopt in order to minimise the damage and compensate the fishermen and industries which have been dramatically affected overnight. endTok	39.91652770444523
startTok How can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained? endTok	88.86075202070232
startTok How can those affected be compensated? endTok	56.900933153026074
startTok This is a very serious problem which the European Union, as an economic, commercial, industrial and fishing power, must tackle. endTok	43.025148430000996
startTok We must get to work and lead the way in these issues which are damaging our environment and destroying industries and occupations. endTok	62.931025860018885
startTok We must adopt preventative measures which can stop disasters like this from happening in the future. endTok	60.747109076240214
startTok This is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries. endTok	12.866747286662308
startTok We hope to hear specific proposals from the Commission, with plenty of action and no more regrets. endTok	59.48878296201418
startTok This House will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups. endTok	60.383887911767
startTok Mr President, the shipwreck of the Erika off the coast of Brittany on 12 December caused an oil slick whose effects on the environment will be felt for years. endTok	43.263091902396916
startTok In addition to destroying natural resources, this accident has had a serious impact on certain economic sectors, particularly those dependent on fisheries. endTok	50.43621010449677
startTok With 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the sunken vessel, the situation could still deteriorate. endTok	65.20017160988968
startTok The consequences of this accident have been disastrous for the aquaculture and ostreiculture sectors which were defenceless against the pollution that could not be prevented from coming ashore. These consequences not only stem from the pollution which occurred immediately after the accident but also the subsequent loss of market share and the rejection by the consumer of a fully guaranteed product which is now affected by the pollution itself. endTok	70.25215127936066
startTok The regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance. They have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which, unfortunately, is not an isolated event. endTok	58.95051146652414
startTok The main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature, which is nowadays too often being punished by man' s activities. endTok	85.91870560701035
startTok These events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities. endTok	53.98364217329457
startTok Prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes. endTok	117.98425751565912
startTok Surely the budget would agree, as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these. endTok	149.7975885482093
startTok Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked. endTok	120.5354652369585
startTok Yet on the issue of the Erika he has given the impression, perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of Brittany and the Vendée, that, as the Fisheries Commissioner, he is not always available or, at best, available only on a part-time basis. endTok	83.73772160930456
startTok As this House indicated in its first resolution on 20 January, the needs of the severely affected fisheries, ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account. endTok	44.349296814177954
startTok We therefore now call upon the Commission to urgently adopt measures to help the fisheries sector by means of special funds. endTok	49.40557520817368
startTok Galicia and Brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks. endTok	124.5241417924514
startTok We cannot understand how it is that experiences like the Urquiola or Amoco Cadiz have not served to reinforce legislation on maritime transport in terms of both controlling safety in the movement of dangerous goods and flags of convenience. endTok	45.90857007904391
startTok Please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this. endTok	82.02823228708569
startTok We must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen. endTok	190.00226254565465
startTok The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate. endTok	35.89619338770223
startTok It is time that polluters started to pay because, up to now, it has been those affected and taxpayers who have paid, and they have not just paid but cleaned up the affected areas as well. endTok	79.59157951817214
startTok I am therefore delighted at Mr Fischler' s response, particularly his recognition of the need to apply retroactive measures and to give a rapid response to the applications submitted. endTok	45.392546153514346
startTok On behalf of the PSE Group, I want to send a message of solidarity to those affected, to the fishermen, farmers and businesspeople who enable the products of the sea to be regularly brought to market. endTok	51.6223986087521
startTok My message of solidarity also goes out to the mayors and politicians, to the volunteers who have worked to clean the affected areas and to all those who deserve our full support. endTok	56.82243881652362
startTok I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner. endTok	23.457012413190245
startTok Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable. endTok	31.62693263255468
startTok The question for the Commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people. endTok	75.27444987544872
startTok The second point relates to the future and the publication of the Commission' s White Paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce European environmental legislation properly. endTok	28.566497125113294
startTok It is recognised in that White Paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified, where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two. endTok	81.78269011898058
startTok The Erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that White Paper is seeking to address. endTok	100.54311527559504
startTok This question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future. endTok	38.034541359484976
startTok The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by EU-regulated dangerous activities and my concern, and perhaps the Commissioner can deal with this, is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of Erika in future. Will it really address the concern or will, in practice, in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas, the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause. endTok	103.75725464580512
startTok Mr President, our sympathy and our solidarity go out to those people and regions stricken by the disaster, but good intentions are not enough, there must be compensation for the damage and losses covering both the restoration of the environment and the shellfish farms and fishing equipment. endTok	57.75583285737631
startTok We are pleased to hear the Commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation, and for this to be backdated. endTok	36.204099681201484
startTok We also deplore the excessively lax application of vessel inspection, and we are in favour of creating a European coast guard authority, and also, in particular, of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory. endTok	67.13369103955807
startTok We further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats. endTok	46.45510828375339
startTok Finally, we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely carcinogenic, with a polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million. endTok	64.64227068178458
startTok This means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products. endTok	70.99683020310925
startTok This is not acceptable. We only found out too late and, as a result, medical inspection must be provided, paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment. endTok	102.5985307248058
startTok Finally, we think it absolutely essential to pay particular attention to preventing such risks, as well as to scientific research work in order to avoid and eliminate damage. endTok	46.35806428789994
startTok A great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation. endTok	78.56882938466225
startTok Solutions cannot be found at the last minute, when the disaster is already in progress. endTok	85.76868450110122
startTok Consequently, the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand. endTok	27.101760634760275
startTok Mr President, over two months after the wreck of the Erika, pollution of the coasts, which have already been cleaned once, is still continuing. endTok	38.86090147655985
startTok While reiterating my solidarity with all the victims of this, I should like to salute the dedication of the workers, professionals and volunteers, who are still involved in cleaning the polluted beaches. endTok	40.16386268985477
startTok Thanks to the grass-roots involvement, which this House furthered by organising a debate and adopting a resolution on 20 January, an initial raft of measures has been announced. endTok	70.38369020578645
startTok The French Government has initiated a discussion and made proposals to strengthen maritime safety, particularly by fighting against the phenomenon of flags of convenience and by implementing much more extensive inspection. endTok	80.66352138373462
startTok The lessons of this latest oil slick must be learnt in full, and decisions must be taken speedily at Community level to prevent coffin ships sailing off our shores or berthing in our ports, to make double hulls mandatory for the transportation of pollutants, and to strengthen standards for safety and inspection. endTok	44.71653192959078
startTok We must also demand that the parties truly responsible be made to pay the costs incurred due to the pollution. endTok	60.94713257153433
startTok So, yes, Total Fina must provide the financial resources to contribute to the repair of ecological, economic and social damage and to compensate the people affected by the disaster. endTok	45.868538119319396
startTok The French State has released funds for compensating damage. endTok	115.96531410616646
startTok I feel, however, that the European Union has so far not actually come up with any expression of Community solidarity at the requisite level. endTok	44.67325753809822
startTok So, yes, appropriations must be released at Community level to support the cleaning of the contaminated coastlines, to assist the organisations which went into action to save oil-covered birds, and to contribute towards getting the affected businesses back on their feet. endTok	88.74870612133502
startTok Specific compensation should be provided for the fishermen and shellfish farmers who have suffered considerable loss of income and who face having to invest considerable sums in order to repair everything and regain consumer confidence. endTok	78.96187562236832
startTok I was pleased to hear the statement which Commissioner Fischler has just made, and I take careful note of the commitments he made before this House. endTok	33.141998827991465
startTok I should also like to say that my Group shall remain vigilant and committed, in collaboration with the grass-roots action groups, to ensuring that the parties affected receive compensation as soon as possible and that legislation is strengthened at every level, supported by realistic penalties in the event of non-compliance. endTok	69.41200620347846
startTok Mr President, the reason why it is important to return to the subject of the oil slick, two and a half months after the wreck of the Erika, is because the extent of the economic, social and ecological disaster affecting our Atlantic coastline is, in fact, far greater than the first assessments gave us to understand. endTok	50.012724352322806
startTok Cakes of tar are still washing in along 500 km of the Atlantic coastline on a daily basis. endTok	42.54721517912355
startTok Curiously, the exact composition of the cargo has still not been clarified. endTok	46.18802281792025
startTok The ecological disaster is a major one, possibly unprecedented in scale. endTok	67.97480975550188
startTok Large-scale degassing proliferates and the 16 000 tonnes of tar remaining in the wreck at a depth of 120 m present a major risk of fresh pollution. endTok	93.64059501521794
startTok All workers in the fishing, fish farming and aquaculture sectors have already been hit hard. endTok	88.95032940547675
startTok The chief victims today are the shellfish farmers who were once the most successful producers in Europe. endTok	103.89681933792514
startTok The frontline victims are the producers or freight forwarders banned in the Vendée and Loire-Atlantique regions. endTok	29.77720823621824
startTok Some of them have already lost several years' worth of harvests, but the 50% to 80% slump in sales is affecting all the harbours on the Atlantic coastline, and even those in the Channel and North Sea. endTok	72.93995817314831
startTok As regards fishing proper, passive gear fishing is currently the hardest hit. endTok	110.82046854294579
startTok After shellfish, the slump is now affecting crustacean sales. endTok	94.1774527255262
startTok The many fishing days lost affect the entire industry and, above all, the future of fishery products, an area in which prices had seen something of a turnaround in very recent years, now hangs entirely on consumer reaction and we are starting to see signs, unfortunately, of initial disenchantment. endTok	145.9453185875021
